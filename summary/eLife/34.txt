This text describes novel discoveries about tumor biology, focusing primarily  upon infectious agents. Overall，the manuscript presents compelling insights regarding contage spreading mechanism employedby malignant tumors arisingfrom Australian marsupplies called Tasmanian Devils(Sarcomorhynchus) highlighting potential therapeutic vulnerabilities associatedwith distinct molecular profiles exhibited amongst various cancerous lesions sampled throughout Australia。The paper explores key aspects related tomindividual immunity suppression caused predominantlyvia impaired Major Histocompatible Complex Class Iappressure presented here suggestthat althoughDFTM exhibits contrasting clinical behavior patternsacross geographically distant locations ; however comparable cellular features characterizeits aggressive nature enabling effective targeting strategies potentially applicable towards controlling disease progression achievedthrough experimental therapies involving immunotherapy approach
