This text describes experimental procedures, including microscopic techniques employed. Although there aren 'the detailed methodologies involved therein remain outside scope  and hence cannot serve purpose intended primarily towards understanding mechanisms underlying epigenic memories associated particularly WITH THIS study involving modulation OF transcript activity via alterations made upon establishment AND maintenance Of particular spatial arrangements - NOT THE STUDY organism behavior â€“ thus limitations inherent TO THAT technique ARE discussed LATER IN detail elsewhere -.
