 Summary & Implications


This paper presents  an extensive modeling effort aimed toward elucidating various aspects related specifically, though indirectly via simulations. Its primary objective involves analyzing factors influencing protease performance within mammalian tissues primarily focusing around "short fluorescent" probes rather complete natural target molecule - albeit providing valuable insight applicable later down stream targets like whole intact antibodies targeting tumor tissue samples derived either post surgical resection procedures conducted routinely during cancer treatment interventions involving targeted therapies against cancerous growths situated deep seated beneath skin surfaces commonly challenging accessibility due high levels inflammation resulting secondary complications arising frequently following surgery procedure itself..
