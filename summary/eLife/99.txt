 Summary & Implications


This manuscript describes  an innovative technique called "site Loc" - Imaging Based Eptope Localization, enabling precise localisation (~nm)   and quantification    in situ. Its primary application involves studying receptor occupancy dynamics during viral infection mechanisms involving pathogens like streptococcus Pneumoiae(Strep). Compared traditionally cumbersome procedures relying upon extensive labeling protocols combinedwith sophisticated equipment demands significant improvements over current methodologies while offering comparable if no better accuracies.<br>< br>
