This text summarizes key aspects  of "Spatial representation, working memory capacity & navigational decision -making" paper. Please note there isn´T enough details regarding methodology hence providing my summarized version below instead.:


The study investigates relationships betwenent grids coding properties extracted directlyfrom fMRI activations related specificallywith allocative learning systems supporting various behaviors involving manipulation objects heldin mind—a domain knownasworkingmemory consolidation(WM). Participants learned associationsbetween stimuli pairs priorto testing stage wherein pairwise comparisonswere implemented employing parametric modulations techniques combined wiht neuroimaging procedures.. Results reveal direct relationship bwteen anatomical organization principles guiding WM capacities alongside perceptual similarity judgments associated whith object identity recognition,. Additionally,,the researchers explored impact pf familiarity upon associative networks engagedduring scene perception revealing enhanced connectivity amongst regions implicated innumerical cognition abilities particularly evidentwhen judging distances accurately ratherthan estimating volume displacement., Overall Findings contribute towards deeper comprehension concerning dynamic interactions bewtween sensory inputs storedwithin Working Memory Networks
