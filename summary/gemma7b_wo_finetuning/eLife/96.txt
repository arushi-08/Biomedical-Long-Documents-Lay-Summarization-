This text describes experimental procedures, including microscopic techniques employed. Although well written up front page five there appear some potential concerns related particularly concerning quantitative accuracy when applying algorithms designed primarily around counting objects whose spatial arrangement determines organism behavior despite possessing little impact upon overall organization principles governing intracellular processes underlying certain behaviors displayed via alterations made evident even under low light illumination circumstances
