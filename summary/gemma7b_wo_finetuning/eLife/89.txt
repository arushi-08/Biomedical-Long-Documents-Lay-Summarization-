 Summary & Significance  


This study investigates, utilizing Supercoiled Molecular Spectroscopy ("CosMOS") methodology coupled live microscopy techniques. It explores key aspects underlying mammalian mRNA alternative slicing regulation involving sequential utilization promoters driving consecutive excision patterns along nascent transcripts called "cross‑spliciton" versus “Cross ExON” scenarios). Key discoveries include :   



**Splicesomal Sub complex Assembly:**    The paper unveils detailed mechanistic insights regarding early stages preceding actual transcript cleavage following transcriptional initiation – namely initial attachment (“binding”)of transacting components like uL Small nucleolar ribosomal component Smu upon newly transcribed primarytranscript fragments forming dynamically assembling intermediate assemblies termed'sub‐complex'. Through CosMos approach employing engineered reporter substrates incorporating tandem FRET pairs spanning various portions including promoter regions essential stabilizing minimal inhibitory signals sufficient high affinity capture rates allowing precise localization tracking down cellular environments representative situations encountered inside living organisms..
