This text describes "The Temporal Compression Effect DuringSocial Interactions"  and provides detailed descriptions about experimental methodologies, behavioral outcomes. However，the abstract lacks specifics regarding theoretical underpinnings behind said phenomena therefore I am unable fully understand key takeaways related specifically within given manuscript unless additional details pertaining methodology design principles applied alongwith particular datasets utilized throughout experimentation aspects discussed herein become clearer upon reviewing entire writeup :


**Key Findings:**   



•TemporalCompression occurs naturally occurring alongside interpersonal engagement involving actual people interacting togetherness displayed visually conveyed emotions expressed verbally.(Experimentation)      • Intranasoal factors influencing timing perceptions vary considerably amongst subjects according personal characteristics,(Experiments four & six).     ﻿ Additionally highlighting possible modulation mechanisms involve manipulating hormone systems regulating attention allocation toward distinct categories comprising emotional expressions(experiments five&six ).
