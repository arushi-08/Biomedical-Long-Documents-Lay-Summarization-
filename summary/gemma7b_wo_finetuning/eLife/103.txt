This text describes "Detection, characterization & modulation  of innate sensing pathways employed throughout life" based primarily around Tolleroceptors. Overallï¼Œthis work provides compelling demonstration about evolutionarily preserved behaviors involving senses such receptor binding ligand interaction across diverse species including humans highlighting universal sensor modalities utilized widely among organisms despite substantial variations amongst various physiological processes like learning behaviour patterns recognition memory formation etc., thereby providing novel insights regarding evolutionary biology principles governing organismal adaptation strategies toward environmental challenges faced frequently encountered situations related specifically microbial pathogenesis associated danger signal transduction initiated predominantly sensed molecules produced mainly pathogenic microbes,.
