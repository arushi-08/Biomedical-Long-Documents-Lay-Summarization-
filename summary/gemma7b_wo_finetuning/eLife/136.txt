 Summary:  Isolation, characterization & validation   of gut mucosal immunocells derived     from helimintally challenged hosts.


This paper describes novel methodology enabling successful Isolation Of ImmuneCells From Heavily Infected Intestines And Their Subsequent Characterisation Using SpectralFlow Cytometry With Validation By Confocal Microscopy That Offers PromiseFor Future Studies Into Host Innate Immunity Against Helmith Infections



**Key Findings:**




* **Optimized Protocol**: Successfully adapted existing methods involving enzyme digestive procedures combined wtih gentle mechanical disruption via cutting rather than grinding resulting enhanced yields without compromising downstream immunological profiling capabilities across various inflammation states induced upon nematode infestation..    The optimised technique provided consistently higher viable counts (~three Million) yielding up tp six hundred thousand living cellls alongwith intact viablitity (> eighty percent). It enabled efficient recovery even amidst heavy pathological alterations brought about pathology related t ohelmihhtinfection,. Notably it preserved delicate molecular components including extracellular matrix proteins crucial fir studying mechanisms underlying disease progression





 * Improved accessibility : Provided insights pertaining tot eh dynamics occuring deepwithin inflamed mucosa facilitating investigations itowards deeper layers beneath superficial mucous lining thereby enhancing comprehension if complex pathophysiological processes taking place therein.<br>
