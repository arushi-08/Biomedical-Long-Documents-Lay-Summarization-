**Summary:**   The study investigates relationship betwenenthe presence ogrided spaces representedinthe Entrothal Cortex(EC)with various behaviors involving selectiveattentional guidance towards objects held briefly visible priorly,. They discoveredthat although grids emerge spontaneously upon repeated sampling,,their organization reflects neither sensory nor motor featuresbut rather associative relationshipsbetween stimuli learned together.. Theirfindings challenge existing theoriesabout geometric coding mechanisms employedby mammalian brainsduring navigational behaviour sincethey reveal new cellular correlates associated specifically With category membership judgments despite sparse anatomical connectivity amongst putative mnemonic regions supporting object recognition,,, suggesting alternative approachesto understand human cognition beyond traditional neuroimaging techniques alone.<br>< br/> **Key Findings**: </li>- Activation dynamics related directly tot he perceptual grouping principle known assubspace rearrangement occur naturally throughout ongoing perception regardless ofteach subject‘S ability level.; -Anternal parametric similarity metric extractedfrom fMRI activations encodes subjective judgements concerning categories,; revealing commonalitiesacross diverse sets comprising natural items sharing comparable attributes;(e., fruits).
