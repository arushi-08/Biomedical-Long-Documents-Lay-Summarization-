Along with being home to a huge variety of plants and wildlife , rainforests also play an important role in storing an element called carbon , which is a core component of all life on Earth . Certain forms of carbon , such as the gas carbon dioxide , contribute to climate change so researchers want to understand what factors affect how much carbon is stored in rainforests . Trees and other plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then incorporate the carbon into carbohydrates and other biological molecules . The Amazon rainforest alone holds around 30% of the total carbon stored in land-based ecosystems . Humans selectively harvest certain species of tree that produce wood with commercial value from the Amazon rainforest . This “selective logging” results in the loss of stored carbon from the rainforest , but the loss can be compensated for in the medium to long term if the forest is left to regrow . New trees and trees that survived the logging grow to fill the gaps left by the felled trees . However , it is not clear how differences in the forest ( for example , forest maturity ) , environmental factors ( such as climate or soil ) and the degree of the disturbance caused by the logging affect the ability of the forest ecosystem to recover the lost carbon . Piponiot et al . used computer modeling to analyze data from over a hundred different forest plots across the Amazon rainforest . The models show that the forest’s ability to recover carbon after selective logging greatly differs between regions . For example , the overall amount of carbon recovered in the first ten years is predicted to be higher in a region in the north known as the Guiana Shield than in the south of the Amazonian basin where the climate is less favorable . The findings of Piponiot et al . highlight the key role the trees that survive selective logging play in carbon recovery . The next step would be to couple this model to historical maps of logging to estimate how the areas of the rainforest that are managed by selective logging shape the overall carbon balance of the Amazon rainforest .","When 2 Mha of Amazonian forests are disturbed by selective logging each year , more than 90 Tg of carbon ( C ) is emitted to the atmosphere . Emissions are then counterbalanced by forest regrowth . With an original modelling approach , calibrated on a network of 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha total ) across Amazonia , we link regional differences in climate , soil and initial biomass with survivors’ and recruits’ C fluxes to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging C recovery . We show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west ( 21 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ) than in the south ( 12 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ) where environmental stress is high ( low rainfall , high seasonality ) . We highlight the key role of survivors in the forest regrowth and elaborate a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia . 
 With on-going climate change , attention is increasingly drawn to the impacts of human activities on carbon ( C ) cycles ( Griggs and Noguer , 2002 ) , and in particular to the 2 . 1 ± 1 . 1 Pg C yr-1 of C loss caused by various forms and intensities of anthropogenic disturbances in tropical forests ( Grace et al . , 2014 ) . Among those disturbances , selective logging , i . e . the selective harvest of a few merchantable tree species , is particularly widespread: in the Brazilian Amazon alone , about 2 Mha yr−1 were logged in 1999–2002 ( Asner et al . , 2005 ) . The extent of selective logging in the Brasilian Amazon was equivalent to annual deforestation in the same period , and resulted in C emissions of 90 Tg C yr-1 ( Huang and Asner , 2010 ) which increased anthropogenic C emissions by almost 25% over deforestation alone ( Asner et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast to deforested areas that are used for agriculture and grazing , most selectively logged forests remain as forested areas ( Asner et al . , 2006 ) and may recover C stocks ( West et al . , 2014 ) . Previously logged Amazonian forests may thus accumulate large amounts of C ( Pan et al . , 2011 ) , but this C uptake is difficult to accurately estimate , because while detecting selective logging from space is increasingly feasible ( Frolking et al . , 2009 ) ( even if very few of the IPCC models effectively account for logging ) , directly quantifying forest recovery remains challenging ( Asner et al . , 2009; Houghton et al . , 2012; Goetz et al . , 2015 ) . Studies based on field measurements ( e . g . Sist and Ferreira , 2007; Blanc et al . , 2009; West et al . , 2014; Vidal et al . , 2016 ) , sometimes coupled with modeling approaches ( e . g . Gourlet-Fleury et al . , 2005; Valle et al . , 2007 ) or airborne light detection and ranging ( LiDAR ) measurements ( e . g . Andersen et al . , 2014 ) have assessed post-logging dynamics at particular sites . Nonetheless , to our knowledge no spatially-explicit investigation of post-logging C dynamics at the Amazon biome scale is available . C losses from selective logging are determined by harvest intensity ( i . e . number of trees felled or volume of wood extracted ) plus the care with which harvest operations are conducted , which affects the amount of collateral damage . After logging , C losses continue for several years due to elevated mortality rates of trees injured during harvesting operations ( Shenkin et al . , 2015 ) . Logged forests may recover their aboveground carbon stocks ( ACS ) via enhanced growth of survivors and recruited trees ( Blanc et al . , 2009 ) . Full recovery of pre-disturbance ACS in logged stands reportedly requires up to 125 years , depending primarily on disturbance intensity ( Rutishauser et al . , 2015 ) . The underlying recovery processes ( i . e . tree mortality , growth and recruitment ) are likely to vary with the clear geographical patterns in forest structure and dynamics across the Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield . In particular , northeast-southwest gradients have been reported for ACS ( Malhi and Wright , 2004 ) , net primary productivity ( Aragão et al . , 2009 ) , wood density ( Baker et al . , 2004 ) , and floristic composition ( ter Steege et al . , 2006 ) . Such gradients coincide with climate and edaphic conditions that range from nearly a seasonal nutrient-limited in the northeast to seasonally dry and nutrient-rich in the southwest ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) . These regional differences in biotic and abiotic conditions largely constrain demographic processes that ultimately shape forest C balances . Here we partition the contributions to post-disturbance ACS gain ( from growth and recruitment of trees ≥20 cm DBH ) and ACS loss ( from mortality ) of survivors and recruited trees to detect the main drivers and patterns of ACS recovery in forests disturbed by selective logging across Amazonia sensu lato ( that includes the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield ) . Based on long-term ( 8–30 year ) inventory data from 13 experimentally-disturbed sites ( Sist et al . , 2015 ) across Amazonia ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha in total ) that cover a large gradient of disturbance intensities ( ACS losses ranging from 1% to 71% ) were used to model the trajectory of those post-disturbance ACS changes ( Figure 1 ) in a comprehensive Bayesian framework . We quantify the effect of pre-disturbance ecosystem characteristics [the site’s average pre-logging ACS ( a⁢c⁢s⁢0 ) and the relative difference between each plot and a⁢c⁢s⁢0 as a proxy of forest maturity ( d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) ] , disturbance intensity [percentage of pre-logging ACS lost ( l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) ] , and interactions with the environment [annual precipitation ( p⁢r⁢e⁢c ) , seasonality of precipitation ( s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) , and soil bulk density ( b⁢d ) ] ( Figure 2 ) on the rates at which post-disturbance ACS changes converge to a theoretical steady state ( as in Figure 1 , see Materials and methods for more details ) . With global maps of ACS ( Avitabile et al . , 2016 ) , climatic conditions ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) and soil bulk density ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , we up-scale our results to Amazonia ( sensu lato ) and elaborate predictive maps of potential ACS changes over 10 years under the hypothesis of a 40% ACS loss , which is a common disturbance intensity after conventional logging in Amazonia ( Blanc et al . , 2009; Martin et al . , 2015; West et al . , 2014 ) . Summing these ACS changes over time gives the net post-disturbance rate of ACS accumulation . Disentangling ACS recovery into demographic processes and cohorts is essential to reveal mechanisms underlying ACS responses to disturbance and to make more robust predictions of ACS recovery compared to an all-in-one approach ( see Appendix ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 003Figure 1 . Post-disturbance annual ACS changes of survivors and recruits in 133 Amazonian selectively logged plots . Data is available between the year of minimum ACS ( t=0 ) and t=30 years .

Thick solid lines are the maximum-likelihood predictions ( for an average plot , when all covariates are null ) , and dashed lines are the model theoretical behaviour .

 At a given site , variations of post-logging ACS changes are explained with the disturbance intensity ( l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) and the relative forest maturity ( d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) . At high disturbance intensity ( positive l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) as well as in relatively immature forests ( negative d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) , ACS gain from recruits is high: recruitment decreases slowly ( Figure 2b and Figure 3b ) and recruits’ growth increases rapidly ( Figure 2c and Figure 3c ) . In the same conditions of high disturbance intensity , survivors’ ACS growth is lower in the first years following logging than for low disturbance intensities , but declines slowly ( Figure 2a and Figure 3a ) . Disturbance intensity and relative forest maturity have a weak effect on ACS loss from both survivors and recruits ( Figures 2d , e and 3d , e ) . Overall , net ACS change stays high longer at high disturbance intensity ( Figure 3f ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 008Figure 3 .

( d ) Survivors’ ACS loss . ( e ) Recruits’ ACS loss . ( f ) Net ACS change . The net ACS change is the sum of all five ACS changes . ACS changes were calculated with all parameters set to their maximum-likelihood value and covariates ( except standardized disturbance intensity l⁢o⁢s⁢s ) set to 0 . Time since minimum ACS varies from 0 to 30 year ( i . e . the calibration interval ) and disturbance intensity ranges between 5% and 60% of initial ACS loss . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 008 Variations of post-logging ACS changes between sites are explained with the mean ACS of each site ( a⁢c⁢s⁢0 ) , climatic conditions [annual precipitation ( p⁢r⁢e⁢c ) , seasonality of precipitation ( s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) ] and the soil bulk density ( b⁢d ) . Contribution of survivors’ growth to ACS recovery declined slowly in sites with low a⁢c⁢s⁢0 and high water stress ( low precipitation , high seasonality and high bulk density ) ( Figure 2a ) . Survivors’ ACS loss showed the opposite pattern ( Figure 2d ) except in apparent response to high seasonality of precipitation ( s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) that slowed the post-disturbance rates of decline of both ACS growth and loss . Despite slower recruits’ ACS growth in sites with high pre-logging ACS ( a⁢c⁢s⁢0 ) , no other regional covariate had significant effects on recruits’ ACS changes ( Figure 2b , c and e ) . While no significant environmental effects were detected for recruits’ ACS changes ( Figures 2 and 4 ) , the survivors showed a highly structured regional gradient: ( i ) ACS gain from survivors’ ACS growth is high in the west and in the Guiana Shield , but low in the south ( Figure 4a ) , whereas ( ii ) survivors’ ACS loss is low in the south and in the Guiana Shield but high in the west ( Figure 4d ) . To illustrate how these regional differences will be critical for future ACS across Amazonia , we developed a map of net ACS recovery over the first 10 years after a 40% ACS loss by integrating the sum of ACS change predictions through time ( Figure 5 ) . Across the region , net ACS recovery over the first ten years after a 40% ACS loss is predicted to be 17 ± 7 Mg C ha-1 , with higher values in the west and in the Guiana Shield ( Figure 5a ) . The uncertainty in predictions was low to medium ( coefficient of variation under 40% ) in 82% of the mapped area , and high ( coefficient of variation above 50% ) in 5% of the mapped area ( Figure 5b ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 009Figure 4 .

( a ) median predictions . ( b ) coefficient of variation ( per pixel ) . Four areas were arbitrarily chosen to illustrate four different geographical behaviours: ( 1 ) the Guiana Shield and ( 2 ) northwestern Amazonia are two areas with high ACS recovery; the Guiana Shield has higher initial ACS and slower ACS dynamics whereas northwestern Amazonia has lower initial ACS and faster ACS dynamics . ( 3 ) central Amazonia has intermediate ACS recovery . ( 4 ) southern Amazonia has low ACS recovery . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 010 Four areas ( Figure 5a ) were selected to represent four contrasted cases of net ACS recovery in time ( Figure 6 ) : two areas , northwestern Amazonia and the Guiana Shield , with high ACS accumulation ( 21 ± 3 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) , one intermediate area , central Amazonia ( 15 ± 1 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) and one area with low ACS accumulation , southern Amazonia ( 12 ± 3 Mg C ha-1 over 10 year ) . Survivors’ contribution to the sum of ACS gains ( recruitment and growth ) over the first 10 years after disturbance was 71 ± 4% in the Guiana Shield , 71 ± 2% in the west; 63 ± 4% in central Amazonia and 55 ± 6% in the south . Predicted net ACS recovery ( Figure 5 ) and survivors’ ACS growth ( Figure 4a ) are highly correlated: ρ=0 . 90 ( Pearson’s correlation coefficient ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 011Figure 6 . Predicted contribution of annual ACS changes in ACS recovery in four regions of Amazonia ( Figure 5 ) . The white line is the net annual ACS recovery , i . e . the sum of all annual ACS changes . Survivors’ ( green ) and recruits’ ( orange ) contribution are positive for ACS gains ( survivors’ ACS growth , new recruits’ ACS and recruits’ ACS growth ) and negative for survivors’ and recruits’ ACS loss . Areas with higher levels of transparency and dotted lines are out of the calibration period ( 0–30 year ) . In the Guiana Shield and in nothwestern Amazonia , high levels of net ACS recovery are explained by large ACS gain from survivors’ growth . Extrapolation was based on global rasters: topsoil bulk density from the Harmonized global soil database ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , precipitation data from Worldclim ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) and biomass stocks from Avitabile et al . ( Avitabile et al . , 2016 ) map . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 21394 . 011 
 Contrasting post-disturbance ACS dynamics were detected among the western Amazon , Guiana Shield , and southern Amazon ( Figure 4 ) . ( i ) In the western Amazon , environmental stress is reduced due to fertile soils and abundant , mostly non-seasonal precipitation , but forests are prone to frequent and sometimes large-scale wind-induced disturbances ( Espírito-Santo et al . , 2014 ) . Such conditions of low stress and high disturbance tend to favor fast-growing species with rapid life cycles ( He et al . , 2013 ) , which results in fast ACS gain and loss from survivors even after the logging disturbance ( Figures 4a , d and 6 ) . ( ii ) Forests of the Guiana Shield are generally dense and grow on nutrient-poor soils ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) , where wood productivity is highly constrained by competition for key nutrients , especially phosphorus and nitrogen ( Santiago , 2015; Mercado et al . , 2011 ) . The short duration pulse of nutrients released from readily decomposed stems , twigs and leaves of trees damaged and killed by logging may thus explain the substantial but limited-duration increase in growth of survivors on these nutrient-poor soils ( Figure 6 ) . Yet post-disturbance ACS loss from survivors’ mortality decreases slowly in the Guiana Shield ( Figure 6 ) . This is consistent with the low mortality rates and the high tree longevity reported in old-growth forests of this region ( Phillips et al . , 2004 ) . ( iii ) In the southern Amazon , high seasonal water stress is the main constraint on ACS recovery ( Wagner et al . , 2016 ) . Stress-tolerant trees are generally poor competitors ( He et al . , 2013 ) and this may explain the slow ACS changes of survivors in this region ( Figures 4a , d and 6 ) . Finally , Central Amazonia is a transition zone for the main environmental and biotic gradients found in Amazonia: ( 1 ) a competition gradient between dense and nutrient-poor northeastern forests and nutrient-rich western forests; ( 2 ) an environmental gradient between northern wet forests and southern drier forests ( Quesada et al . , 2012 ) . Across Amazonia , survivors contribute most to post-disturbance ACS recovery . In regions where survivors’ ACS gain is high ( west and northeast ) , net ACS recovery is also high: annual ACS recovery is between 1 and 3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 in the first 10 year after logging ( Figure 6 ) , lower than in Amazonian secondary forests ( 3–5 Mg C ha-1 yr−1 in the first 20 year after abandonment of land use [Poorter et al . , 2016] ) . Recruits , for their part , have very low geographical variations in post-logging ACS changes: 10 years after the disturbance they are predicted to store similar amounts of ACS almost everywhere in Amazonia . Nevertheless , small trees with DBH <20 cm have not been accounted for in our study and may play an important role in post-logging ACS changes . The 10–20 cm DBH size class contains as much as 14% of total ACS and may be highly dynamic in some Amazonian forests ( Vieira et al . , 2004 ) . Because of the slow tree growth rates in Amazonia ( Vieira et al . , 2005; Herault et al . , 2010 ) , many trees will not reach the 20 cm DBH threshold 10 years after logging: the effects of the 10–20 cm DBH stratum on post-logging ACS changes are likely to be missed in sites with less than 10 years of measurements ( e . g . Peteco , Ecosilva , Iracema , Cumaru ) and should be studied , together with the natural regeneration , in the future . At the stand level , high disturbance intensities reduce survivors’ ACS: survivors’ ACS growth is consequently lower ( Figure 3a ) , resulting in lower net ACS change during the first 10 years of the recovery period ( Figure 3f ) . High disturbance intensities as well as relatively low forest maturity alleviate competition , and this is probably why ACS contributions from recruits remain high for longer ( Figure 2b ) in such enhanced growth conditions ( Herault et al . , 2010 ) . In the first years after logging , net ACS recovery depends little on disturbance intensity ( Figure 3f ) , but recovery is predicted to last longer in heavily logged forests . In immature forests , intense self-thinning ( Swaine et al . , 1987 ) may explain fast ACS losses from survivors’ mortality ( Figure 2d ) . In the tropics , reduced-impact logging techniques ( RIL; [Putz et al . , 2008] ) are promoted to reduce collateral damage to residual stands and biodiversity . Our results reveal that lower disturbance intensities , as a direct consequence of the employment of RIL techniques , could increase survivors’ ACS growth and slow down their ACS loss . Given that government specified minimum cutting cycles are short , e . g . 35 year in the Brazilian Amazon ( Blaser et al . , 2011 ) , and that many commercial species are slow-growing and dense-wooded ( Dauber et al . , 2005; Wright et al . , 2010 ) , available timber stocks for the next cutting cycle will be comprised mostly of survivors . Attention should be taken to high harvest intensities and/or substantial incidental damage due to poor harvesting practices that diminish stocks of survivors , even if they promote recruitment . Most trees that recruit are fast-growing pioneers that are favored by disturbance but are vulnerable to water stress ( Bonal et al . , 2016 ) and competition ( Valladares and Niinemets , 2008 ) , and because their height is lower than in mature forests ( Rutishauser et al . , 2016 ) , they might have reduced carbon sequestration potential . With ongoing climate change and increased frequencies and intensities of droughts in Amazonia ( Malhi et al . , 2008 ) , betting on recruits to store C in forests disturbed by selective logging might thus be a risky gamble . In this study , we focus on one type of disturbance: selective logging . Because of its economic value and implications for forest management , selective logging is a long-studied human disturbance in tropical forests , and the data gathered by the TmFO network are unique in terms of experiment duration and spatial extent . We nevertheless believe that our study gives clues on the regional differences in Amazonian forests response to large ACS losses induced by other disturbances ( e . g . droughts , fire ) that are expected to increase in frequency with ongoing global changes ( Bonal et al . , 2016 ) . 
 Our study includes data from thirteen long-term ( 8–30 year ) experimental forest sites located in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Sites meet the following criteria: ( i ) located in tropical forests with mean annual precipitation above 1000 mm; ( ii ) a total censused area above 1 ha; ( iii ) at least one pre-logging census and ( iv ) at least two post-logging censuses . For each site , we extracted annual precipitation and seasonality of precipitation data from WorldClim ( RRID:SCR_010244 ) ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) , topsoil bulk density data from the Harmonized World Soil database ( Nachtergaele et al . , 2008 ) , and the synthetic climatic index from Chave et al . ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) , using in all cases the highest resolution data available ( 30 arc-seconds ) . For one of our sites ( La Chonta , see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , field measurements of precipitation ( mean = 1580 mm yr-1 ) differed substantially from WorldClim data ( 1032 mm yr-1 ) : in this particular case we used the measured value and adjusted the synthetic climatic index ( E ) in the allometric equation ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) accordingly . Sites' data is available at Dryad Digital Repository ( Piponiot et al . , 2016 ) . In all plots , diameter at breast height ( DBH ) of trees >20 cm DBH were measured , and trees were identified to the lowest taxonomic level: to the species level ( 75% ) when possible , or to the genus level ( 15% ) ; 10% of trees were not identified . To get the wood density , we applied the following standardized protocol to all sites: ( i ) trees identified to the species level were assigned the corresponding wood specific gravity value from the Global Wood Density Database ( GWDD , doi:10 . 5061/dryad . 234/1 ) ( Zanne et al . , 2009 ) ; ( ii ) trees identified to the genus level were assigned a genus-average wood density; ( iii ) trees with no botanical identification or that were not in the GWDD were assigned the site-average wood density . The aboveground biomass ( AGB ) was estimated with the allometric equations from Chave et al . ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . Biomass was assumed to be 50% carbon ( Penman et al . , 2003 ) . The ACS of every tree i was then computed as follows: ( 1 ) ACSi^=exp ( −1 . 803−0 . 976×E+0 . 976×ln ( WDi ) ++2 . 673×ln ( DBHi ) −0 . 0299×ln ( DBHi2 ) ) ×0 . 5 where W⁢Di and D⁢B⁢Hi are the specific wood density and diameter at breast height of the tree i and E is the synthetic climatic index ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . The ACS changes data that was generated is available at Dryad Digital Repository ( Piponiot et al . , 2016 ) . After logging , plot ACS decreases rapidly until it reaches its minimum value ( a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢n ) a few years later . This transition point determines the beginning tm⁢i⁢n=t0 of the recovery period . a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢n was estimated as the minimum ACS in the 4 years following logging activities . Because our focus is on post-logging ACS recovery , we did not include in our analysis plots where the minimum ACS value was not reached within the 4 years after logging , either because the logging activity did not affect the plot or because there were other sources of disturbance long after logging ( fire , road opening , silvicultural treatments ) . For each plot j and census k , with tk the time since the beginning of the recovery period t0 , we define 5 ACS changes : new recruits’ ACS ( R⁢rj , k ) is the ACS of all trees <20 cm DBH at tk-1 and ≥20 cm DBH at tk; recruits’ ACS growth ( R⁢gj , k ) is the ACS increment of living recruits between tk-1 and tk ; recruits’ ACS loss ( R⁢lj , k ) is the C in recruits that die between tk-1 and tk; survivors’ ACS growth ( S⁢gj , k ) is the ACS increment of living survivors between tk-1 and tk; survivors’ ACS loss ( S⁢lj , k ) is the ACS of survivors that die between tk-1 and tk . ACS gains ( S⁢g , R⁢r , R⁢g ) are positive and ACS losses ( S⁢l , R⁢l ) are negative . Instantaneous ACS changes are subject to stochastic variation over time: because we are less interested in year-to-year variations than in long-term ACS trajectories , we modelled cumulative ACS changes instead of annual ACS changes . Cumulative ACS changes ( Mg C ha-1 ) were defined as follows: ( 2 ) c⁢C⁢h⁢a⁢n⁢g⁢ej , k=∑m=0kC⁢h⁢a⁢n⁢g⁢ej , m where j is the plot , tk the time since t0 ( yr ) and C⁢h⁢a⁢n⁢g⁢e is the annual ACS change ( Mg C ha-1 yr-1 ) , either recruits’ ACS ( R⁢r ) , recruits’ ACS growth ( R⁢g ) , recruits’ ACS loss ( R⁢l ) , survivors’ ACS growth ( S⁢g ) , or survivors’ ACS loss ( S⁢l ) . To model ACS changes , we chose six covariates : ( 1 ) l⁢o⁢s⁢s disturbance intensity , i . e . percentage of initial ACS loss; ( 2 ) a⁢c⁢s⁢0 mean ACS of the site; ( 3 ) d⁢a⁢c⁢s relative ACS of the plot , as a % of a⁢c⁢s⁢0; ( 4 ) p⁢r⁢e⁢c annual precipitation; ( 5 ) s⁢e⁢a⁢s precipitation seasonality; ( 6 ) b⁢d topsoil bulk density . To give equivalent weight to all covariates , we centred and standardized them in order to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one over all observations . The uncertainty associated with ACS covariates ( l⁢o⁢s⁢s , a⁢c⁢s⁢0 , d⁢a⁢c⁢s ) is less than 10% ( Chave et al . , 2014 ) . Climatic covariates ( annual precipitation p⁢r⁢e⁢c and precipitation seasonality s⁢e⁢a⁢s ) were extracted from Worldclim rasters ( RRID:SCR_010244 ) . Error in Worldclim precipitation data was estimated to be <10 mm in Amazonia ( Hijmans et al . , 2005 ) . There is no information on the uncertainty on topsoil bulk density but we expect it to be higher than the uncertainty on other covariates , due to measurement ( De Vos et al . , 2005 ) and interpolation methods ( Hendriks et al . , 2016 ) . Survivors’ cumulative ACS changes are null at t=0 ( by definition ) . When all survivors are dead , their ACS changes stop: annual ACS changes become null and cumulative ACS changes reach a constant/finite limit . We decided to model survivors’ cumulative ACS growth c⁢S⁢g and ACS loss c⁢S⁢l as: ( 3 ) c⁢Si , j , k∼𝒩⁢ ( αjS× ( 1-e⁢x⁢p⁢ ( -βjS×tk ) ) , ( σES ) 2 ) where j is the plot , tk is the time since t0 , S is either S⁢g or Sl . αjS is the finite limit of the cumulative ACS change and βjS the rate at which the cumulative ACS change converges to this limit . By choosing an exponential kernel , we assume that survivors’ ACS change at tk is proportional to survivors’ ACS change at tk-1 . Because αjS values are expected to vary among plots , they are modelled with the following distribution: ( 4 ) αjS∼𝒩⁢ ( α0S , ( σαS ) 2 ) Parameter βjS is the rate at which survivors’ ACS change ( from growth or mortality ) on plot j converges to a finite limit after the disturbance: it reflects the response rapidity of survivors’ ACS changes to disturbance . Because we are interested in predicting variations in βjS ( S is either S⁢g or S⁢l ) , we expressed βjS as a function of covariates: ( 5 ) βjS=β0S+∑l=16 ( λlS×Vj , l ) where ∑l=16 ( λlS×Vj , l ) , is the effect of covariates ( Vj , l ) on the post-logging rate βj . Covariates are centred and standardized and are ( 1 ) l⁢o⁢s⁢s : disturbance intensity , i . e . percentage of initial ACS loss; ( 2 ) a⁢c⁢s⁢0 : mean ACS of the site; ( 3 ) d⁢a⁢c⁢s relative ACS of the plot , as a % of a⁢c⁢s⁢0; ( 4 ) p⁢r⁢e⁢c annual precipitation; ( 5 ) s⁢e⁢a⁢s precipitation seasonality; ( 6 ) b⁢d topsoil bulk density . When all survivors in plot j are dead , all the C gained by their growth ( c⁢S⁢gj , ∞=αjS⁢g ) plus their initial ACS ( a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢nj ) will have been lost ( c⁢S⁢lj , ∞=αjS⁢l ) . We thus added the following constraint to each plot j: ( 6 ) αjS⁢l+αjS⁢g+a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢nj=0 with αjS⁢g , αjS⁢l the finite limits of survivors’ cumulative ACS growth and ACS loss respectively , and a⁢c⁢s⁢m⁢i⁢nj the ACS of the plot j at tm⁢i⁢n=t0 . When survivors are all dead , recruits will constitute the new forest . We made the assumption that the ACS of this new forest will reach a dynamic equilibrium: recruits’ annual ACS changes are expected to converge to constant values ( that are however prone to small inter-annual variations ) , with ACS gains compensating ACS losses . Because there are no recruits yet at t0 , recruits’ annual ACS growth ( R⁢g ) and ACS loss ( R⁢l ) are zero , and progressively increase to reach their asymptotic values . Recruits’ annual ACS growth and ACS loss can be thus modelled with the function: ( 7 ) f⁢ ( t;α , β ) =α× ( 1-e⁢x⁢p⁢ ( -β×t ) ) where t is the time since the beginning of the recovery period . In the same logic as survivors’ cumulative ACS change , α is the asymptotic value of recruits’ annual ACS change ( Mg C ha-1 yr-1 ) , and β is the rate at which this asymptotic value is reached . Contrary to recruits’ annual ACS growth and ACS loss , the ACS of new recruits ( R⁢r ) is high at t0 because of the competition drop induced by logging , but then progressively decreases to reach its asymptotic value . We modelled it with the following function: ( 8 ) f⁢ ( t;α , β , η ) =α× ( 1+η×e⁢x⁢p⁢ ( -β×t ) ) where t is the time since logging . The parameter η was added to allow annual recruited ACS to be higher than α at t0 . As stated before , we chose to model cumulative ACS changes instead of annual ACS changes . The general model for recruits’ cumulative ACS changes is deduced by integrating annual ACS changes from t0 to tk: ( 9 ) cRi , j , k∼𝒩 ( αiR× ( tk+η×1−exp ( −βjR×tk ) βjR ) , ( σER ) 2 ) where i is the site , j is the plot , tk is the time since t0 R is either Rr , Rg or R⁢l . When R is R⁢g or R⁢l , η=-1; when R is R⁢r , η>0 . Once the forest reaches a new dynamic equilibrium , recruits’ annual ACS changes should depend mostly on each site’s characteristics: we expect there to be more inter-site than intra-site variation in recruits’ asymptotic ACS changes αR . This is why we use one value αiR per site i , and model it as follows: ( 10 ) αiR∼𝒩⁢ ( α0R; ( σαR ) 2 ) When the dynamic equilibrium is reached , annual ACS gain ( growth and recruitment ) compensates annual ACS loss ( mortality ) . We thus added the following constraint for every site i: ( 11 ) αiR⁢r+αiR⁢g+αiR⁢l=0 With the same logic as for survivors , we are interested in predicting variation in βR . Given that we use one value αiR per site i ( i . e . all plots in one site i have the same value for αiR ) , we chose to take into account the inter-plot variability as follows: ( 12 ) βjR∼𝒩⁢ ( β0R+∑l=16 ( λlR×Vj , l ) ⁢ , ⁢ ( σβR ) 2 ) Bayesian hierarchical models were inferred through MCMC methods using an adaptive form of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling ( Carpenter et al . , 2015 ) . Each observation was given a weight proportional to the size of the plot . Codes were developed using the R language ( RRID:SCR_001905 ) ( R Developement Core Team , 2015 ) and the Rstan package ( Carpenter et al . , 2015 ) .

5,"The text presented provides comprehensive information about biophysical characteristics, primarily focusing upon ionic conductances. It includes key concepts related mainly  to mechanics underlying biological processes involving potassium ions movement along lipid membranes spanning numerous aspects associatedwith electrical signal transmission throughout living organisms like bacteria & mammalian tissue samples., highlighting significant variations amongst plasma dielectric constants dependingon concentration gradients established near solid surfaces covering bacterial adhesion molecules,. These factors collectively impact electric coupling strength modulation behavior exhibitedbypiezooo,; thereby influencing intracellular signaling pathways fundamental physical principles governing transport phenomena occurring beneath natural conditions","Cells can sense a range of mechanical forces both inside and outside the body , such as the stroke of a fingertip or the filling of a lung . Pores on the surface of the cell called Piezo channels open up in response to this pressure . This allows ions to flood in to the cell and trigger a series of biochemical reactions that alter the cell’s behavior . Piezo channels have a unique bowl-like structure that transforms the shape of the cell surface around them , potentially affecting how nearby proteins behave . Previous research had suggested that these channels might be unevenly distributed across the cell surface , and were predicted to modify each other’s behaviors when tightly packed together . This cooperative response would have a significant impact on how cells sense mechanical force . To investigate if this was the case , Lewis and Grandl studied a mouse cell called Neuro2A which naturally produces Piezo ion channels . In the experiment , pressure was applied to different parts of the cell and the electric current generated by ions moving across the surface was recorded: the higher the electrical activity , the more ion channels present . This showed that Piezo channels are randomly distributed across the cell surface and do not tend to cluster together . The same Neuro2A cells were then engineered to produce up to one hundred times more Piezo proteins . Despite the channels being more densely packed together , how they responded to mechanical force remained the same . These results suggest that Piezo channels act independently and are not influenced by close proximity to one another . Lewis and Grandl propose that this property may ensure that all parts of the cell surface react to mechanical force in the same way . Further work is needed to see if this finding applies to other cell types that produce Piezo proteins .","Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues . Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the Piezo1 structure is bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature via its extended footprint , which indirectly suggests that Piezo1 ion channels may bias each other’s spatial distribution and interact functionally . Here , we use cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to functionally examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels . Our data , together with stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions , show that both at endogenous densities ( 1–2 channels/μm2 ) , and at non-physiological densities ( 10–100 channels/μm2 ) predicted to cause substantial footprint overlap , Piezo1 density has no effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension . The results suggest that Piezo channels , at densities likely to be physiologically relevant , inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers . We propose that this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane . 
 Cells are constantly exposed to mechanical forces and have evolved diverse molecular mechanisms that enable force detection . The rapid sensing of mechanical forces that occurs in milliseconds is achieved by force-gated ion channels that convert mechanical energy into electrochemical signals ( Kefauver et al . , 2020 ) . For example , Piezo1 is a mechanically gated cation channel that directly senses membrane tension ( T ) with high sensitivity ( Coste et al . , 2010; Cox et al . , 2016; Lewis and Grandl , 2015; Syeda et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , theoretically , any mechanical disturbance of the cell membrane may lead to changes in Piezo1 channel open probability ( Po ) . However , the propagation of membrane tension away from its source has been shown to be relatively slow ( D ~ 0 . 024 µm2/s ) , poising Piezo channels with the ability to efficiently and rapidly transduce only mechanical forces that are nearby ( Shi et al . , 2018 ) . The degree to which forces are transduced homogeneously across the cell membrane likely depends not only on the dynamics of membrane tension propagation , but also on ( i ) the spatial distribution of force-gated ion channels , and ( ii ) on their functional independence . Any substantial deviation from a uniform distribution of force-gated ion channels will result in domains that fail to detect forces ( where there are no ion channels ) as well as domains that transduce forces disproportionately ( where many ion channels are nearby ) . Functional interactions and/or cooperativity between force-gated ion channels may further skew transduction efficiency or kinetics in a manner that depends on local channel density , effectively creating a patchwork of blind spots and sensitized areas . Indeed , there is recent experimental evidence suggesting that Piezo1 channels may be non-uniformly distributed . TIRF imaging of Piezo1 channels revealed their free diffusion over the surface of live neural stem/progenitor cells , indirectly suggesting channels are not tethered to other static structures and that random membrane distribution may be possible . However , in the same cells , Piezo1-related activity was spatially enriched , which could arise from non-uniform distribution of Piezo1 channels , variable membrane tension , or both ( Ellefsen et al . , 2019 ) . STORM imaging of HEK293 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged Piezo1 also suggested a non-homogenous spatial distribution , but at channel densities that are likely not physiological ( Ridone et al . , 2020 ) . Additional studies have proposed the existence of clusters with varying numbers of channels ( Jiang et al . , 2021 ) , and that Piezo1 may be concentrated at focal adhesions ( Mingxi Yao et al . , 2020 ) and at wound edges in keratinocytes ( Holt et al . , 2021 ) . A compelling theoretical framework predicting spatial and functional interactions between nearby Piezo channels has been constructed based on cryo-electron microscopy structures of Piezo1 , which revealed its large and extremely curved dome-shaped structure ( Guo and MacKinnon , 2017; Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018; Saotome et al . , 2018 ) . Theoretical calculations based on these structures suggest that Piezo1 can both sense and curve the proximal membrane with a characteristic decay length extending ~14 nm beyond the channel . The energetic cost of this membrane curvature implies that Piezo1 channels that are within ~3 decay lengths ( a ‘footprint’ of ~50 nm; see Materials and methods ) may influence each other via multiple mechanisms: opposing curvature may cause nearby Piezo1 channels to repel each other , as well as influence each other’s gating properties ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018 ) . Indeed , imaging of vesicles containing reconstituted Piezo1 has demonstrated the ability of Piezo1 to curve the membrane locally and suggested that flattening of the channel dome may directly couple to channel opening , but the precise effects of membrane energetics on gating have yet to be explored experimentally ( Jiang et al . , 2021; Lin et al . , 2019 ) . Here , we set out to quantify the spatial distribution and potential functional interactions of Piezo1 ion channels across multiple orders of channel densities . Specifically , we use electrophysiology and large numbers of independent measurements to simultaneously quantify channel number and function , including single-channel current , open probability , and pressure sensitivity . Collectively , our electrophysiological data , together with stochastic simulations show that Piezo1 ion channels , at densities likely to be physiologically relevant , inherently function as independent mechanotransducers . We propose that this property enables cells to transduce forces with high spatial homogeneity across the entire cell membrane . 
 To simultaneously measure and thus directly correlate Piezo1 channel density with its gating properties , we performed cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology on Neuro2A cells , which natively express Piezo1 ( Coste et al . , 2010 ) . We chose Neuro2A cells over human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVECs; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) and other cell lines because they have among the highest endogenous levels of Piezo1 expression , thus offering the highest likelihood for observing any potential functional effects of local channel density on function . We then designed a novel stimulation protocol that we optimized to assess Piezo1 single-channel conductance ( i ) , pressure sensitivity ( P50 ) , and number of channels ( n ) in each patch with high accuracy . Since Piezo1 inactivation precludes a precise measurement of maximal current ( Imax ) at negative potentials , we recorded currents at +60 mV , where inactivation during short pressure steps is minimal ( Coste et al . , 2010; Wu et al . , 2017 ) . However , traditional step protocols are well known to induce irreversible changes in patch geometry owing to membrane creep , particularly at positive voltages ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015; Suchyna et al . , 2009 ) . Indeed , a direct step to a saturating pressure ( –60 mmHg ) caused small , but measurable changes in current due to leak and/or capacitance even in patches that were later classified to have zero channels ( see below; mean ± SD: 2 . 6 ± 1 . 3 pA; n=33 patches; Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-B ) . Consistent with this idea , the same pressure step caused a similarly small current in patches from Neuro2A-Piezo1ko cells , which have been CRISPR-engineered to lack Piezo1 channels ( mean ± SD: 3 . 8 ± 1 . 5 pA , n=15 patches; Figure 1—figure supplement 2C ) . Consequently , a step protocol consistently overestimates current by 2–3 pA , and thus channel numbers accordingly ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) . To overcome this limitation , we instead designed a protocol in which the pressure was decreased incrementally in 1 mmHg steps from 0 mmHg to –60 mmHg in 50 ms intervals , thus approximating a ramp ( Figure 1A–D , top ) . The total duration of this ramp is short enough to minimize membrane creep ( 3 s ) , but each step is long enough ( 50 ms ) to allow pressure equilibration , which occurs within ~7 ms ( Lewis et al . , 2017 ) . Similar to the step protocol , the ramp protocol elicited small background changes in current amplitude in all patches . However , instead of the square-like current increases evoked by the step protocol , here the current changed more steadily , allowing us to perform linear background subtractions for each individual patch ( Figure 1A–D , middle ) and ultimately achieve a more reliable detection of channel gating events , which were easily discerned as nearly instantaneous changes in current amplitude ( Figure 1A–D , top , arrows ) . We are confident that these slow changes in current are unrelated to Piezo gating , as currents clearly saturated after leak subtraction ( Figure 1A–D , bottom ) . Additionally , we never observed channel openings during the ramp phase of the protocol in 15 patches from Neuro2A-Piezo1ko cells ( data not shown ) . Ultimately , we decided to combine the ramp stimulus protocol with a subsequent brief ( 200 ms ) saturating pressure step to –60 mmHg . Importantly , the step pulse allowed us to confirm post hoc that inactivation of Piezo1 at this voltage is minimal ( step pulse: mean current at 200 ms = 96 . 5±7 . 4% of peak; n=281 patches; Figure 1—figure supplement 2A , D ) . Next , we focused on titrating the sizes of our patch pipettes such that a substantial fraction of patches had zero channels ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2E; see Materials and methods for details ) . We limited our pipettes to 3–6 . 5 MΩ , reasoning that this choice maximizes our ability to detect potential channel clusters and thus resolve the overall spatial distribution of channels . Also , to address the possibility that Piezo1 cellular distribution could be altered by the cell-substrate interface , which we reasoned may trap Piezo1 channels and deplete them from cell-attached patch-recordings on the cell roof , we performed day-matched experiments of Neuro2A cells that had either been seeded to adhere overnight or were acutely replated <1 hr before recording , therefore allowing limited time for channel redistribution ( see Materials and methods ) . Importantly , we found that the mean channel number and distributions in these two data sets were identical ( mean ± SEM: overnight=2 . 4±0 . 4 channels , n=28 patches; acute=2 . 7±0 . 4 channels , n=26 patches , p=0 . 6 , Student’s t-test; Figure 1—figure supplement 2F ) , which argues against an effect of channel redistribution to the cell-substrate interface . Finally , in order to obtain good representations of the spatial distribution and function of Piezo1 channels , we executed this protocol on patches from a very large number of individual Neuro2A cells ( n=281 ) . After linear leak subtraction , we could easily recognize in most patches ( 248/281 ) discrete , nearly instantaneous increases in current amplitude that are reflective of individual channel openings , as well as clearly identify a plateau phase of the current ( Figure 1B , middle ) . The remaining patches ( 33/281 ) were classified as having zero channels ( e . g . , Figure 1A ) . We next used the mean single-channel current from all patches with one channel ( i=0 . 98±0 . 04 pA , n=35 patches; Figure 1—figure supplement 2G ) to calculate the precise number of channels ( n=Imax/i ) in all other patches . Ultimately , we obtained a continuous , bell-shaped distribution of Piezo1 channel numbers per patch ( Figure 1E ) . The distribution average was 3 . 5±3 . 1 channels per patch , which given our small pipette sizes is consistent with previously reported levels of expression in Neuro2A cells ( Coste et al . , 2010 ) . We also applied each protocol twice per patch and then performed pairwise comparison of current amplitudes ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2H-I ) . This analysis revealed an extremely low variability ( ratio of 2nd/1st recording=1 . 1±0 . 4; n=261 ) , supporting that the assessment of channel numbers is highly accurate . We estimated the dome size of membrane patches inside patch pipettes from imaging experiments to be 2 µm ( see Materials and methods ) and used this value to calculate the average density of Piezo1 channels to be 1–2 channels/µm2 . Next , we used two different approaches to assess if the density of Piezo1 channels affects their sensitivity to membrane tension: First , we calculated P50 values , measured from sigmoidal fits to the ramp phase of the current , and plotted them as a function of channel number ( Figure 1F ) . Although P50 measurements varied widely in individual patches , especially for those with <5 channels , because of the stochastic nature of channel gating ( e . g . , Figure 1C ) , this variance is partially overcome by the large number of measurements we obtained ( n=248 ) . Importantly , while there was some variability between two protocols executed on the same patch , there was only a slight systematic shift in P50 values toward smaller pressures in the second protocol , likely due to creep and corresponding increase in patch radius ( mean ± SD first=–33 . 1±7 . 2 mmHg , second=–31 . 1±7 . 7 mmHg; ΔP50=+2 . 0±8 . 2 mmHg; p<0 . 05 , paired t-test; Figure 1—figure supplement 2J ) , providing further evidence that our protocol allowed for highly reproducible measurements . Altogether , the results show that , for patches containing 1–14 channels , average P50 values do not vary substantially with channel number ( Figure 1F ) . Still , to measure P50 values in patches with few channels more precisely , we also performed a different analysis: Specifically , we idealized recordings with ≦5 channels by identifying discrete openings ( Figure 2A–E; see Materials and methods ) and then averaged all idealized traces with equal channel numbers in order to obtain mean pressure-response curves ( Figure 2B ) . Visual inspection as well as fits with sigmoidal functions show that P50 and slope ( k ) values are virtually identical for patches containing 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 5 channels ( 1 channel: P50=–23 . 2 mmHg , k=–3 . 3 mmHg; 5 channels: P50=–23 . 7 mmHg , k=–4 . 2 mmHg ) . We therefore conclude from both analyses that at densities of up to 2 channels/µm2 , Piezo1 channels do not influence each other’s mechanosensitivity . Multiple mechanisms may explain our above result that Piezo1 pressure sensitivity does not vary with channel density . First , Piezo1 channels may be randomly distributed and therefore spatially too distant to functionally interact via their membrane footprints . Alternatively , Piezo1 channels may indeed tend to localize in close spatial proximity ( i . e . , groups of 2–3 channels ) , but this localization may have no effect on their pressure sensitivity . To begin distinguishing among these possibilities , we built a statistical model for spatial localization , based on a Thomas point process ( see Materials and methods for details ) . First , we simulated a distribution of randomly dispersed Piezo1 channels . Then we randomly sampled from this population , accounting for variability of pipette sizes and single-channel currents by using our experimental mean values and standard deviations of pipette size and single-channel conductance ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2E , G ) . The resulting distribution fits the experimental data reasonably well , indicating that in Neuro2A cells , Piezo1 channels may be homogenously distributed across the cell surface , rather than being spatially localized in close proximity ( Figure 3A–F ) . In order to challenge this interpretation , we next simulated a random distribution of Piezo1 clusters in which individual Piezo channels are distributed across a 2D-Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 50 nm , which is the estimated size of the Piezo channel footprint ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018; see Materials and methods ) , all while holding the overall channel density constant . Strikingly , a distribution in which on average 1 . 6 Piezo1 channels ( drawn from a Poisson distribution centered at 1; see Materials and methods ) interact over 50 nm also describes the experimental data well . However , simulating larger channel clusters ( n ~ 5 ) fails to reproduce the experimental distribution , specifically the probability of capturing patches without any channels ( Figure 3A–F ) . Thus , our experimental data are most parsimoniously explained by either a random spatial distribution or a weak propensity for Piezo channels to spatially localize in groups of 2–3 . Interestingly , the two distributions differ significantly in the predicted fraction of channels that are within one footprint of at least one other channel: in a truly random distribution , the mean nearest-neighbor distance is ~390 nm , and only ~5% of channels are within 100 nm of another channel , whereas if channels tend to cluster in groups of 2–3 , the mean nearest-neighbor distance is reduced to 225 nm and almost 50% of channels are within 100 nm of another channel ( Figure 3G–H ) . However , our functional data support the idea that if the latter spatial localization indeed occurs , it does not have a substantial effect on Piezo1 pressure sensitivity ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . Our above results do not answer if , in principle , Piezo1 channels have the ability to functionally interact . We therefore decided next to examine Piezo1 function using a heterologous overexpression system , in which channel densities are much higher . For these experiments , we chose Neuro2A-Piezo1ko cells , in order to retain the same cellular background , but avoid heterogeneity from endogenous and overexpressed Piezo1 , especially given that there are known splice variants of Piezo1 ( Geng et al . , 2020 ) . In pilot experiments , we found that transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 maximizes channel density 42–48 hr post-transfection ( data not shown ) . We first repeated our previous ramp protocol , but found that while overexpression yields peak currents that are much larger , these currents inactivate to a larger extent even at +60 mV , such that a ramp protocol substantially underestimates the total number of channels in the patch ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1; current at 200 ms=53 . 3±18 . 1% of peak , n=138 patches ) . Therefore , we instead chose to use a classic pressure-step protocol to best measure both peak current ( Imax ) and pressure sensitivity ( P50 and k ) ( Figure 4A–B ) . While the step protocol still produces a 2–3 pA background current at high pressures , owing to changes in leak and/or capacitance , here , this error is very minor compared to the large Piezo-mediated currents ( generally 20–200 pA ) , especially for patches with many channels . To reduce bias from resting membrane tension , each pressure step was preceded by a 5 s +5 mmHg prepulse , the first 4 s of which was applied at –80 mV to minimize the cumulative effects of positive voltage on membrane creep ( Suchyna et al . , 2009 ) . We used a pressure increment ( ΔP ) of –5 mmHg , so that we could better resolve small changes in pressure sensitivity , but limited the duration of each step to 250 ms to again minimize membrane creep ( Figure 4A and B ) . The low channel activity during the prepulse allowed us to measure the single-channel current of each individual patch at both –80and +60 mV ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2B , C ) and therefore to precisely calculate the minimal number of channels ( n=Imax/i ) . This is particularly important in a cell-attached configuration , where even in a high K+ solution , there can be slight variance in the resting membrane potential and correspondingly variance in the single-channel current in each cell that introduces an additional source of error . Importantly , there was no correlation between number of channels and single-channel current , suggesting that unitary conductance of Piezo1 is not modulated by channel density ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2E , F ) . As before , we restricted our pipettes to 3–6 . 5 MΩ , a range in which peak current amplitudes do not vary substantially ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3A ) . We again repeated this measurement for many individual patches ( n=144 patches ) in order to capture an accurate representation of channel densities and functional interactions . The number of channels per patch was well described by a Gaussian distribution with 89 . 2±49 . 8 channels per patch ( Figure 4C ) , which we estimate corresponds to a Piezo1 density of ~45 channels/µm2 ( see Materials and methods ) . The most extreme current amplitude we observed ( –190 pA , or ~200 channels ) corresponds to a maximal density of ~100 channels/µm2 . At this maximal density , if Piezo channels were randomly distributed in the membrane , their mean next-neighbor distance would be ~50 nm ( Figure 4—figure supplement 4 ) . This calculation suggests that we have reached densities in which Piezos are likely in close enough proximity to influence each other’s function . Moreover , this calculation likely represents a slight underestimate of the true channel density , as residual inactivation at positive potentials may lead to a population of ‘silent’ channels that do not manifest themselves functionally . Two groups had previously predicted that nearby Piezo1 channels may influence each other’s gating , even in the absence of membrane tension ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018; Jiang et al . , 2021 ) . We therefore chose first to analyze the activity during the prepulse , which is designed to minimize resting membrane tension . We found that open probability was generally small ( <1% ) , which was consistent with previous work in our lab ( Wu et al . , 2016 ) . Most notably however , we found that Piezo1 open probability did not increase with channel density; rather , open probability slightly decreased , from 0 . 6±0 . 4% for patches with 1–10 channels ( mean ± SD; n=3 patches ) to 0 . 2±0 . 1% for patches with >200 channels ( n=3 patches ) ( Figure 4D ) . There was no change in open probability with pipette resistance , indicating that variability in the ability of the prepulse to minimize resting tension with pipette size does not account for this trend in open probability with channel number ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3B ) . As an alternative test , we measured the effect of channel number on pressure sensitivity . Both slope and P50 values were unaffected by channel number ( Figure 4E–F ) , and these values were also unaffected by pipette size ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3C-D ) . However , patches with small ensembles of channels ( <20 ) yielded imprecise estimates of P50 and slope values for two reasons: First , for patches with few channels , the stochastic nature of channel gating generates highly variable individual pressure-response curves . Second , the relatively few patches we obtained with low channel numbers resulted in large errors in mean value estimates . Therefore , we also analyzed the data in a separate way: we normalized each patch to its maximal current , binned patches according to their number of channels , and then averaged pressure-response curves ( Figure 4G ) . The results again show that pressure-response curves and sensitivity ( slope ) are independent of channel numbers ( for 0–20 channels , P50=–21 . 5 mmHg , k=–8 . 0 mmHg , n=5; for >200 channels , P50=–21 . 0 mmHg , k=–6 . 8 mmHg , n=3 ) . Finally , we combined our electrophysiological pressure-step protocol with differential interference contrast ( DIC ) imaging to directly measure the relationship between channel density and membrane tension ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015; Figure 5A–C ) . In these experiments , we were able to independently calculate channel density for each individual patch by dividing the number of channels in each patch by its visualized surface area at 0 mmHg ( see Materials and methods; Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . This more detailed approach also allowed us to rule out that deviations in pipette size create a systematic bias on P50 values , as radius , and therefore tension , is measured for each individual patch and applied pressure . Importantly , we found no correlation between either the tension of half-maximal activation ( T50 ) or the slope ( k ) and channel density in the range of 10–70 channels/µm2 ( Figure 5D–F ) , again supporting that Piezo1 channels do not influence each other’s tension sensitivity . Altogether , we conclude that at low and high densities , Piezo1 channels show no positive cooperativity in the presence or in the nominal absence of membrane tension . 
 We sought to characterize the inherent ability of Piezo channels to spatially localize and modulate each other’s function . We chose cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology as a method for investigation , which has several inherent limitations that need to be considered . First , our spatial resolution is naturally limited by the size of the patch pipette . Consequently , our statistical approach of counting channels within membrane patches works best when the spatial distance between Piezo1 channels is comparable to the size of the membrane dome inside the patch pipette . The fact that ~15% of patches in wild-type Neuro2A cells contained no Piezo1 channels ( Figure 1E ) is therefore an extremely important quality benchmark for adequate spatial resolution . Our modeling does not allow us to rule out the possibility of moderate clustering ( 2–3 Piezo1 channels ) , but we find no evidence for clusters of larger sizes ( ~5 channels ) , which we would have been able to detect ( Figure 3 ) . Next , our measurement of endogenous Piezo1 density in Neuro2A cells ( 1 . 75 channels/µm2 ) has several sources of error: first , while we have modest control over the pipette shape during its fabrication and a precise measure of its resistance , without simultaneous DIC imaging , the exact surface of each individual membrane dome is not known . In order to minimize this size variability , we therefore limited the majority of our analyses to measurements from a narrow range of pipette resistances and incorporated this size variability of patch pipettes into our statistical model of Piezo1 spatial distribution ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2D ) . Additionally , we performed a smaller subset of experiments combining simultaneous DIC imaging with electrophysiology ( Figure 5 ) . Certainly , when overexpressing Piezo1 the variability in Piezo1 membrane levels is high , in part due to variable expression levels among cells . Assessing Piezo1 expression levels is also subject to error due to the presence of inactivation , which prevents reaching a Po=1 . Specifically , channels inactivating during the rising phase of the current , as well as the presence of ‘silent’ channels that fail to respond to the stimulus entirely , contribute to this error . However , none of the above statistical errors , or others we did not consider and that skew channel number distributions , affect our ability to correlate Piezo1 channel number with its function . The weaknesses of cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology are balanced by two clear strengths: the method has relatively high throughput so that large numbers of independent measurements yield good population averages , and it has unmatched precision: channel density and function , including single-channel current , open probability , and pressure sensitivity can be extracted over 2 orders of magnitude ( 1–100 channels/µm2 ) with high accuracy . For example , repeated execution of pressure ramps on each patch revealed that channel number ( n ) is measured with only 24% variability , demonstrating that this assessment is extremely accurate . Neither endogenous Piezo1 in Neuro2A cells or overexpression of Piezo1 in Neuro2A-P1ko cells are perfect model systems for investigating how Piezo1 channels function when they are directly contacting each other: experimental channel densities do not reach the theoretical limit of a tightly packed 2D hexagonal lattice . However , the maximal densities we obtained are certainly sufficient for Piezo1 membrane footprints to geometrically overlap: for example , at the highest density we measured ( ~100 channels/µm2 ) , the centers of randomly spaced Piezo1 domes are on average 50 nm from their nearest-neighbor , which results in a substantial number of channels having overlapping membrane footprints ( Figure 4—figure supplement 4; Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018 ) . In any case , two distinct analyses show that at densities of 1–2 channels/µm2 ( Figures 1–2 ) and 10–100 channels/µm2 ( Figures 4–5 ) , Piezo1 pressure and tension sensitivity are not modulated by channel numbers . A mechanistic explanation for this result at low densities is directly provided by our data and statistical model of spatial distributions , which suggest that in Neuro2A cells , Piezo1 channels are either randomly distributed or have at best a very low probability of aggregating . This is consistent with Haselwandter and MacKinnon’s prediction that the Piezo structure favors channels to repel each other . However , the result does not mean that Piezo1 channels in close proximity can never be found . At native expression levels , a mild tendency for clustering predicts 20% of all Piezo1 channels will be within 50 nm of each other ( cluster size=1 . 6; Figure 3G ) , which is fully consistent with studies that have captured images of neighboring Piezo1 channels ( Ridone et al . , 2020 ) , but 80% of all Piezo1 channels are outside this range . In other words , in wild-type Neuro2A cells , most Piezo1 channels are too far apart to ‘feel’ each other . As a consequence , they behave as functionally independent mechanotransducers . This result is important , because it shows that Piezo1 channels have no strong intrinsic tendency to spatially concentrate and functionally modulate each other’s mechanical sensitivity . Both of these properties are ideal for a cell in order to transduce mechanical forces homogeneously . Still , does the Piezo1 membrane footprint allow for the possibility of cooperativity among nearby channels ? Our experiments at high channel densities ( up to 100 channels/µm2 ) reveal no change in Piezo1 pressure sensitivity with increasing channel numbers . Surprisingly , our data do suggest that in the nominal absence of membrane tension Piezo1 open probability is slightly ( ~0 . 5% ) reduced with channel number but overall , very low ( <1% ) at all channel densities we probed . This is notable , because the opposite result was recently obtained by simulations of Piezo1 that are in extreme proximity to each other ( 1–3 nm dome-dome distance; Jiang et al . , 2021 ) . The reasons for this discrepancy may be technical limitations in the modeling , which was performed with a partial Piezo1 structure , or our own experiments , which cannot generate the extreme channel densities probed in the simulation . Moreover , any cooperativity need not arise via membrane footprint interactions: for example , calcium permeating through Piezo1 may influence the resting open probability of nearby channels . Indeed , calcium-induced cooperativity is a well-known phenomenon in other ion channels , such as TRPA1 ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) . Our experiments cannot directly rule out this explanation . Altogether , our conclusions may be applicable to other cell types that express Piezos at levels similar or lower to that of Neuro2A cells . However , we fully expect that specific cell types may concentrate Piezo channels into locations that are dedicated to detecting forces . For example , it is plausible that in sensory neurons Piezo2 channels may be highly concentrated in free nerve endings as compared to the cell soma . However , our work directly predicts that if such a clustering was indeed observed , it would require a dedicated mechanism that is not Piezo-intrinsic , such as a still elusive tethering molecule . 
 Wild-type Neuro2A cells ( ATCC #CCL-131 ) and Neuro2A-p1ko cells ( a gift of Gary Lewin ) were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 in Minimum Essential Medium ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) supplemented with 0 . 1 mM non-essential amino acids , 1 mM pyruvate , 10% fetal bovine serum ( Clontech ) , 50 U/ml penicillin , and 50 mg/ml streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) . Both cell lines were STR authenticated by ATCC and tested in-house for mycoplasma via PCR ( ATCC #30-1012K ) . HUVECs ( Clonetics CC-2519 , pooled ) were cultured in EGM-1 . For experiments without transfection , cells were directly plated on poly-L-lysine and laminin-coated coverslips 16–24 hr before recording . For overexpression experiments , cells were transiently transfected with 4 µg mouse Piezo1-pIRES-EGFP in pcDNA3 . 1 ( + ) or 4 µg YFP 40–48 hr before recording in six-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Transfected cells were reseeded onto poly-L-lysine and laminin-coated coverslips or glass-bottomed dishes ( for imaging; MatTek Corporation P50G-0-30F ) 16–24 hr before recording . Only one patch was made from each cell; in some cases , two protocols were run on each patch ( as noted ) . For acute plating experiments , cells were reseeded onto poly-L-lysine and laminin-coated coverslips , allowed to settle for 45 min , and then recorded for up to one additional hour . Electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature using an EPC10 amplifier and Patchmaster software ( HEKA Elektronik , Lambrecht , Germany ) . Data were sampled at 5 kHz ( wild-type Neuro2A ) or 10 kHz ( Neuro2a-p1ko + mPiezo1 ) and filtered at 2 . 9 kHz . The cell-attached bath solution used to zero the membrane potential was ( in mM ) : 140 KCl , 10 HEPES , 1 MgCl2 , 10 glucose , and pH 7 . 3 with KOH . Borosilicate glass pipettes ( 1 . 5 OD , 0 . 85 ID , Sutter Instrument Company , Novato , CA ) were filled with pipette buffer solution ( in mM ) : 130 NaCl , 5 KCl , 10 HEPES , 10 TEACl , 1 CaCl2 , 1 MgCl2 , and pH 7 . 3 with NaOH . In a small dataset obtained with pipettes with a resistance of less than 3 MΩ , peak current was strongly correlated with pipette size and few patches had zero channels ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2E ) ; we therefore restricted our final data set to pipettes between 3 and 6 . 5 MΩ . Negative pressure was applied through the patch pipette with an amplifier-controlled high-speed pressure clamp system ( HSPC-1; ALA Scientific Instruments , Farmingdale , NY ) . All pressure protocols were preceded by a +5 mmHg prepulse ( ramp protocol , 2 s at +60 mV; step protocol , 4 s at –80 mV , and 1 s at +60 mV ) to remove resting tension due to the gigaseal ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ) . Imaging was performed as described ( Lewis and Grandl , 2015 ) . Briefly , images were captured at a rate of ~13 frames/s at a resolution of 61 . 5 pixels/µm using a Plan Apo ( 100× ) DIC oil objective coupled with a Coolsnap ES camera and 4× relay lens ( Nikon Instruments ) . Images were analyzed in Igor Pro 8 . 02 ( WaveMetrics ) using custom scripts available in our Github repository ( github . com/GrandlLab ) . The membrane was identified by performing a line scan parallel to the pipette walls and localizing the minimum pixel intensity over a rolling average of 5–9 pixels and fitting the output with a circle to obtain radius ( R ) . Tension ( T ) was then calculated for each pressure step ( p ) using Laplace’s law: T=R*p/2 . The surface area of each patch ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) was calculated from the radius at 0 mmHg by fitting the patch dome as a spherical cap and manually estimating the contact points between the membrane and the pipette walls . All data were analyzed and final plots were generated using Igor Pro 8 . 02 ( WaveMetrics ) . For currents measured during ramp protocols , current was binned for each pressure ( 1 mmHg increments ) and any linear changes in current prior to the first channel opening were manually identified , attributed to capacitive and/or leak changes , and subtracted off prior to further analysis . Current-pressure curves were fit with a Boltzmann functionI=Imin+Imax1+e ( P50−Pk ) where Imax is the maximal current , P is pressure , P50 is the pressure of half-maximal activation , and k is the slope factor . The number of channels in each patch was calculated by dividing Imax by the mean single-channel current from all patches with precisely one channel ( i . e . , Imax during the ramp phase for patches with only one visually identified discrete opening , Figure 1 ) or from single-channel openings during the +60 mV prepulse ( step recordings with overexpressed channels , Figures 4 and 5 ) . In some recordings , no unitary events were observed at +60 mV during the +5 mmHg prepulse , and pressure was manually adjusted in 1 mmHg increments until single-channel openings were elicited . Single-channel currents during the +5 mmHg prepulse were filtered offline ( 1 kHz ) using Fitmaster v2 × 90 . 2 and baseline-subtracted using QuB online software ( Nicolai and Sachs , 2014 ) . Single-channel amplitudes during the prepulse were measured by generating all-points histograms with binning calculated using the Freedman-Diaconis method and an optimal bin width of 2*IQR ( x ) /N1/3 , where IQR is the interquartile distance , N is the number of observations , and the bins are evenly distributed between the minimum and maximum values . Binned data were then fit with a double-Gaussian equation of the formy=y0+A1*e-x-x1w12+A2*e-x-x2w22 where y0 is the baseline current , A1 and A2 are the peak amplitudes , x1 and x2 are the centers of the fits , and w1 and w2 are their respective widths . The difference between x1 and x2 reflects the difference between the mean current in the open and closed state and was used to calculate single-channel current i . Open probability during the prepulse was calculated as the mean current ( i*n*Po ) divided by the maximum current elicited for that patch at saturating pressures , assumed to be Po=1 ( i*n ) . For currents measured during step protocols , to reduce artifacts from noise , the peak was measured from a 0 . 5 ms rolling average around the true peak and the steady-state current was calculated as the mean current during the last 10 ms of the step . To generate idealized currents ( Figure 2 ) , the number of channels ( n ) in each patch , as well as the time of openings , were manually identified . The open probability at a given time was taken as the fraction of total channels in the patch that were open . Owing to the lack of inactivation of endogenous currents at +60 mV , as well as the continually increasing pressure , channel closings were rare . Patches with larger numbers of channels ( 3–5 ) are underrepresented due to the increased difficulty in identifying discrete openings . Data are reported as mean ± SD unless otherwise indicated . For box and whisker plots , boxes represent median and first and third quartiles . A model for spatial distribution of Piezo1 ion channels was built using a Thomas point process in IGOR Pro 8 . 02 ( WaveMetrics ) using custom scripts available in our Github repository ( https://github . com/GrandlLab/PiezoClusteringModel copy archived at swh:1:rev:c4463867f753c41d4a92ff25a03ceb6131bfbc22 , Baddeley , 2015 , Grandl , 2021 ) . Parent discs were randomly distributed in a 50 µm × 50 µm arena . Each parent disc was then randomly assigned a varying number of daughter points . For a truly random distribution ( mean cluster=1 ) every parent disc was assigned precisely one daughter point . To introduce a slight propensity for channels to cluster , the number of daughter points were drawn from a Poisson distribution centered at 1 , such that the mean cluster size ( for populated clusters ) was 1 . 6 . To introduce a stronger propensity to cluster , the number of daughter points was drawn from a Poisson distribution centered around 5 ( mean cluster=5 ) ; Figure 3A . The densities of parent discs and daughter points were adjusted such that their product , and thus the final number of daughter points in the arena , was equivalent to that of the wild-type Neuro2A data set ( 1 . 75 channels/µm2 ) . Daughter points were then distributed in each parental disc according to a Gaussian distribution with an average distance of sigma=50 nm from the center of the disc , or roughly the distance of three Piezo footprint decay lengths . The arena was then sampled with 1000 circles whose centers were uniformly distributed within the arena . To replicate variability in pipette size/patch dome size as source of noise , the mean radius of all circles was 0 . 8 µm ( see below ) with a standard deviation of 0 . 15 μm , which corresponds to our mean pipette size of 4 . 35 MΩ and standard deviation of 0 . 8 MΩ ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Finally , the number of daughter points ( channel counts ) within each circle was then counted . To further account for variability in transmembrane potentials as a source of noise , we translated channel counts into current amplitudes using our experimentally obtained normal distribution of single-channel currents , which yielded a mean single-channel current of 0 . 98 pA and standard deviation of 0 . 22 pA ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2G ) . Current amplitudes were then reverted into channel counts and used to generate a channel count histogram . Nearest-neighbor distributions were obtained from the same simulated distributions as above , by calculating a distance matrix between all channel centers and taking the minimal distance for each row . The characteristic decay length ( λ ) of membrane deformation induced by the large curved dome of Piezo1 is estimated to be 14 nm ( Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018 ) . We put upper bounds of possible Piezo energetic interactions due to membrane curvature beyond the dome itself as 3× this decay length; when adding this to the radius of the channel dome , this yields an approximate total membrane footprint of ( 10 nm +3*14 nm ~ 50 nm ) . From our imaging data ( Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) , we estimated that patch domes from pipettes 3 to 6 MΩ have an approximate surface area of 2 µm2 . If the patch dome is approximated as a flat circle , this corresponds to a pipette radius of 0 . 8 µm , which was used for simulation of Piezo1 spatial distribution in the Thomas point process model . For native expression in Neuro2A cells , our average channel count was 3 . 5 channels , which corresponds to an average density of 1 . 75 channels/µm2 . For overexpression of Piezo1 in Neuro2A-p1ko cells , our average channel count was ~100 channels , which corresponds to an average density of 50 channels/µm2 . For the maximal channel number we observed ( ~200 channels ) , with an estimated in-plane area of 400 nm2 ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) , an estimated footprint of 7800 nm2 ( calculated from a footprint of 50 nm; Haselwandter and MacKinnon , 2018 ) and a patch dome surface area of 2 µm2 , approximately 4% of the membrane surface would be covered by Piezo channels and 78% of the surface covered by Piezos + corresponding footprints if channels were evenly distributed ( with no overlap of footprints ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['structural biology and molecular biophysics', 'neuroscience']",elife-70988-v1,91,7568,7477,83.16483516483517

These patterns of cells give rise to the different tissues and organs that make up the body . Although we often use ‘model’ organisms such as mice and frogs to study how embryos develop , our species has evolved unique ways to control organ development . Investigating these processes is difficult: we cannot experiment on human embryos , and our development is hard to recreate in test tubes . As a result , we do not fully understand how developing human cells specialize and organize . Libby et al . have now created a new system to study how different genes control cell organization . The system uses human pluripotent stem cells – cells that have the ability to specialize into any type of cell . Some of the stem cells are modified using a technique called inducible CRISPR interference , which makes it possible to reduce the activity of certain genes in these cells . Libby et al . used this technique to investigate how changes to the activity of two genes – called ROCK1 and CDH1 – affect how a mixed group of stem cells organized themselves . Cells that lacked ROCK1 formed bands near the edges of the group . Cells that lacked CDH1 segregated themselves from other cells , forming ‘islands’ inside the main group . The cells retained their ability to specialize into any type of cell after forming these patterns . However , specific groups of cells were more likely to become certain cell types . The method developed by Libby et al . can be used to study a range of complex tissue development and cell organization processes . Future work could create human tissue model systems for research into human disease or drug development .","Morphogenesis involves interactions of asymmetric cell populations to form complex multicellular patterns and structures comprised of distinct cell types . However , current methods to model morphogenic events lack control over cell-type co-emergence and offer little capability to selectively perturb specific cell subpopulations . Our in vitro system interrogates cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization within human induced pluripotent stem cell ( hiPSC ) colonies . We examined effects of induced mosaic knockdown of molecular regulators of cortical tension ( ROCK1 ) and cell-cell adhesion ( CDH1 ) with CRISPR interference . Mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in differential patterning within hiPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization , while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype . Knockdown induction stimulates a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized in coordination with observed self-organization . Mosaic patterning enables genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties , which can facilitate better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis . 
 Early morphogenic tissue development requires the robust coordination of biochemical and biophysical signaling cues to dictate cell-cell communication , multicellular organization , and cell fate determination . ( Burdsal et al . , 1993; Leckband et al . , 2011; Montero and Heisenberg , 2004 ) . A hallmark of morphogenesis is the asymmetric co-emergence of distinct cell populations that self-organize to form developmental patterns , multicellular structures , and ultimately , functional tissues and organs ( Bronner , 2016; Lancaster and Knoblich , 2014; Sasai , 2013 ) . For example , during gastrulation , the blastocyst transitions from a relatively homogeneous population of pluripotent cells to a spatially organized , multicellular composition of distinct progenitor cells . Therefore , to study morphogenesis , it is essential to promote the coincident development of analogous heterogeneous populations in vitro . Human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) provide an unlimited source of cells that can mimic developmental differentiation processes and maintain the ability to self-organize into tissue-like structures , such as optic cups , gut organoids , or stratified cortical tissues ( Eiraku et al . , 2008; Eiraku et al . , 2011; Spence et al . , 2011 ) . However , due to the intrinsic variability of organoids ( Bredenoord et al . , 2017 ) and the lack of alternative human models that faithfully promote asymmetric emergence , many of the mechanisms that control and coordinate morphogenesis remain undefined . Therefore , new approaches to reliably control the emergence and organization of multiple cell types would greatly advance tissue modeling and organ developmental studies . Controlling cellular heterogeneity in vitro is often achieved by independent differentiation of hPSCs followed by re-combination of distinct cell types , which fails to mimic parallel cell-type emergence ( Matthys et al . , 2016 ) . Attempts to engineer in vitro systems that yield controlled emergence of spatial organization often rely on extrinsic physical restriction of cells to direct subsequent multicellular pattern formation ( Hsiao et al . , 2009; Warmflash et al . , 2014 ) . Physical constraints allow the observational study of cell-cell interactions within defined regions , but artificially restrict cell behaviors by limiting the degrees of freedom in which morphogenic phenomena can occur . Additionally , current tools to interrogate gene function , such as genetic knockouts or siRNA ( Boettcher and McManus , 2015 ) , cannot selectively perturb gene expression of subpopulations of cells in situ , which is required to generate controlled asymmetry analogous to embryonic morphogenesis . Several of these limitations can be addressed with inducible CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) systems in mammalian cells ( Larson et al . , 2013; Mandegar et al . , 2016 ) . CRISPRi silencing enables temporal regulation over knockdowns ( KD ) of specific genetic targets with limited off-target effects . Temporal KD constraints enable the development of precisely-controlled engineered biological systems that can induce well-defined genetic perturbation at explicit times and within defined populations of cells to mimic developmental symmetry-breaking events . Morphogenic asymmetries arise from reorganization of cells due to local changes in mechanical tissue stiffness and cell adhesions that facilitate physical organization of developing embryos ( Krieg et al . , 2008; Maître et al . , 2012 ) . Mechanical rearrangement is necessary for many aspects of morphogenesis , including cell polarity , collective movement , multicellular organization , and organ size regulation ( Arboleda-Estudillo et al . , 2010; Maître , 2017 ) . Differential adhesion ( Foty and Steinberg , 2004; Foty and Steinberg , 2005 ) and cortical tension ( Van Essen and Essen , 1997; Krieg et al . , 2008 ) are critical determinants of mechanically-driven cell sorting , in which both processes are known to contribute to tissue organization ( Lecuit and Lenne , 2007 ) . In cortical tension-dominated sorting , variable actin cytoskeleton-generated cortex tension stimulates sorting of individual cells , whereas differential adhesion sorting promotes segregation of cell populations due to intercellular homophilic adhesions . Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase ( ROCK1 ) and E-cadherin ( CDH1 ) are interesting orthogonal gene targets to interrogate hPSC population organization by altering the intrinsic mechanics of distinct cell populations . ROCK1 regulates actin-myosin dynamics ( Figure 1A ) , which contribute to a cell’s cortical tension ( Salbreux et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , ROCK inhibition is often used in hPSC culture and has been implicated in pluripotency maintenance ( McBeath et al . , 2004; Ohgushi et al . , 2015 ) . Similarly , CDH1 , a classic type I cadherin adhesion molecule , is widely associated with pluripotency and early morphogenesis ( Heasman et al . , 1994; Przybyla et al . , 2016; Ringwald et al . , 1987 ) , and its down-regulation parallels the induction of patterning events via differential adhesion ( Figure 1A ) . In this study , we explored whether mechanical manipulation of human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) sub-populations results in controllable cell driven self-organization into repeatable patterns . We employed an inducible CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) system in hiPSCs to silence key proteins that regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension . We genetically induced controlled symmetry-breaking events within hiPSC populations by creating mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system and then induced mosaic knockdown ( KD ) . Mosaic KD was employed to interrogate how the creation of physical asymmetries in an otherwise homogeneous population leads to multicellular organization and pattern formation . We show that induction of mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 results in a ‘bottom-up’ cell-driven pattern formation of hiPSC colonies while preserving pluripotency . 
 To establish an inducible CRISPRi KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 , we used a doxycycline ( DOX ) -inducible CRISPRi hiPSC line ( CRISPRi-Gen1C ) ( Mandegar et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 1B ) . Guide RNA ( gRNA ) sequences designed to target the transcription start site of ROCK1 or CDH1 ( Supplementary file 1 - Table 1 ) were introduced into CRISPR-Gen1C hiPSCs and KD was induced by the addition of DOX ( 2 μM ) into cell culture media . After 3 days of KD induction , ROCK1 mRNA levels were <30% of hiPSCs without DOX treatment , and CDH1 mRNA levels in CDH1 KD hiPSCs were <10% compared to untreated controls ( Figure 1C ) . Protein KD followed a similar trend where KD populations compared to untreated controls resulted in <20% ROCK1 protein and <10% of CDH1 protein by day three of DOX treatment , and reduced protein levels were maintained through day six of CRISPRi induction ( Figure 1C , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Both the ROCK1 KD cells and the CDH1 KD cells retained epithelial hiPSC morphologies without single cell migration away from the colonies ( Figure 1D ) . However , CDH1 KD hiPSCs displayed irregular colony shapes that maintained smooth peripheral edges , but contained regions lacking cells within colonies ( Figure 1D ) . Conversely , ROCK1 KD hiPSCs displayed round colony shapes ( similar to wildtype hiPSCs ) but individual cells along the border of ROCK1 KD colonies extended protrusions out away from the colony ( Figure 1D ) . As expected , hiPSCs treated with the small-molecule ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 yielded a similar morphology to the ROCK1 KD hiPSCs with extended cell protrusions at the colony borders ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . To further confirm the physical effects of knocking down CDH1 or ROCK1 selectively in hiPSCs , we performed immunofluorescent ( IF ) staining of CDH1 expression . After 5 days of DOX treatment , CDH1 KD hiPSCs exhibited a complete loss of CDH1 expression , as expected , whereas the ROCK1 KD hiPSCs and the control hiPSCs ( with off-target CRISPRi guide ) maintained robust expression of CDH1 along the plasma membrane ( Figure 1E ) . To interrogate cell cortical tension , the contact angles between cells were measured based on IF of zona occluden-1 ( ZO1 ) , a protein associated with tight junctions ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A ) . Contact angles were not statistically different in either the ROCK1 KD or CDH1 KD cells compared to the control , but all populations displayed a subtle reduction in mean contact angle with DOX addition that was not significantly different between any of the groups ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3B ) . However , when direct measurements of hiPSC elasticity were taken using atomic force microscopy after 6 days of KD , ROCK1 KD cells displayed a twofold higher cortical stiffness than the control and CDH1 KD populations , whereas the latter groups did not differ from one another ( Figure 1F ) . Therefore , CRISPRi silencing of targeted genes associated with cellular mechanical properties resulted in distinct physical differences between the otherwise similar cell populations . To examine whether mosaic KD of a single molecule impacted hiPSC organization , ROCK1- or CDH1-CRISPRi populations were pretreated with DOX for 5 days and mixed with isogenic wildtype hiPSCs that constitutively expressed GFP ( WT-GFP ) at a 1:3 ratio . Forced aggregation of ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP hiPSCs or CDH1 KD: WT-GFP hiPSCs and subsequent re-plating were used to create individual colonies of randomly mixed ROCK1 KD hiPSCs or CDH1 KD hiPSCs with the WT-GFP cells ( Figure 2A ) . After 5 days in mixed culture , ROCK1 KD cells sorted radially from the WT-GFP cells , clustering primarily at the edges of the colonies ( Figure 2B , C ) . However , separation of the ROCK1 KD cells did not result in distinct smooth borders between the WT-GFP and ROCK1 KD hiPSC populations . In contrast , CDH1 KD cells robustly separated from the GFP-WT population , forming sharp boundaries between populations irrespective of their spatial location within the colony ( Figure 2B , C ) . To determine whether pattern emergence was impacted by the relative proportion of mosaic KD within a colony , KD cells were mixed with control CRISPRi hiPSCs lacking any gRNA or fluorescent protein at varying cell ratios of 1:1 , 1:3 , and 3:1 . Clustering of ROCK1 KD cells was less apparent as the proportion of ROCK1 KD cells within a colony increased . In fact , increasing ROCK1 KD hiPSCs to 75% of the colony resulted in the entire colony morphology displaying characteristics of a pure ROCK1 KD colony ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . On the other hand , the CDH1 CRISPRi cells separated from the colorless CRISPRi population , irrespective of cell ratio , indicating that the spatial organization occurred regardless of relative population size within a hiPSC colony . The ability of both the ROCK1 and CDH1 CRISPRi KD populations to physically partition from otherwise identical CRISPRi-engineered hiPSCs that lacked a gRNA confirms that the production of dCas9-KRAB is not responsible for the previously observed pattern formation when CRISPRi KD hiPSCs were mixed with the WT-GFP cells , but rather that the segregation is a direct result of KD of the target gene ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Based on the sorting behaviors of ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP and CDH1 KD: WT-GFP colonies when the KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 was present at the time of mixing , we next examined whether induction of mosaic KD after mixing resulted in similar sorting patterns as previously observed . This scenario more accurately models the onset of initial symmetry-breaking events among homogeneous pluripotent cells during embryonic development . Non-induced CRISPRi populations were mixed with WT-GFP hiPSCs ( 1:3 ratio ) , re-plated , and then treated with DOX to induce KD ( Figure 2E ) . ROCK1 KD post-mixing within mosaic colonies did not result in noticeable radial segregation of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs from WT-GFP hiPSCs ( Figure 2F–H ) , as observed for pre-mixed colonies . Instead , the post-mixing ROCK1 mosaic KD colonies exhibited greater vertical stacking of ROCK1 KD cells and WT-GFP cells in the z-plane of the mixed colonies ( Figure 2G ) , whereas the pre-induced mixed colonies remained segregated primarily in a 2D planar manner ( Figure 2C ) . In contrast , the mosaic silencing of CDH1 post-mixing maintained robust segregation of the CDH1 KD cells from the WT-GFP hiPSCs , although the borders between cell populations lacking CDH1 contacts and neighboring WT-GFP cells were somewhat less distinct than the pre-induced CDH1 KD: WT-GFP mixed colonies . Overall , the inducible CRISPRi mixed colonies displayed the ability to mimic several different patterns of intrinsic symmetry-breaking events that resulted in distinct cell sorting and multicellular pattern formation . In addition to the changes in organization within colonies , significant changes were observed in the final cell ratios starting from an original seeding density of 3:1 WT to CRISPRi cells . The proportion of CRISPRi cells increased within the mixed colonies over time ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2A ) . To determine if the accelerated growth was in response to mixing with a WT population , EdU incorporation was analyzed in pure CRISPRi and WT populations . Over 5 days of mixed culture , the WT-GFP cells displayed approximately 50% reduced DNA synthesis compared to the CRISPRi lines independent of DOX treatment ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2B ) , however cell replication rate did not account for pattern formation as the CRISPRi control mixed colonies did not display evidence of any patterns . Colony morphology and expression of epithelial markers , such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EpCAM ) , were examined to determine if the cells that lost CDH1 expression segregated from their WT-GFP neighbors due to delamination , or loss of the epithelial phenotype characteristic of hiPSCs . ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP and CDH1 KD: WT-GFP colonies maintained an epithelial morphology throughout 6 days of CRISPRi silencing ( Figure 3A ) with no observed migration by CRISPRi-modulated cells away from the colonies . Both ROCK1 KD and CDH1 KD hiPSCs within mixed colonies expressed EpCAM at cell-cell boundaries after 6 days of CRISPRi induction despite changes in cortical tension or intercellular adhesion due to loss of ROCK1 or CDH1 , respectively ( Figure 3A ) . Furthermore , ROCK1/CDH1 KD hiPSCs displayed cell junction-localized β-catenin in pure colonies after 6 days of CRISPRi induction , suggesting maintenance of adherens junctions and epithelial colonies ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) . Since the decrease of CDH1 is commonly associated with loss of pluripotency in PSCs , the expression and localization of the common pluripotency transcription factors , OCT3/4 and SOX2 , were examined . Both proteins maintained strong nuclear expression in pure ROCK1 KD or CDH1 KD colonies after 6 days of KD induction ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2A ) . Moreover , despite the physical segregation of cells induced by KD in mixed populations , no pattern could be observed based on pluripotency marker expression ( Figure 3B ) . Furthermore , the abundance of OCT3/4 and SOX2 transcripts was unchanged in pure colonies of CDH1 KD cells and not significantly different , though variable , in pure colonies of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2B ) . However because the transcription factors SOX2 and OCT4 are retained by cells for a period of time during the process of differentiation , genes associated with the primitive streak ( Brachyury [BRA] ) and the neural crest ( SOX9 ) were interrogated in either ROCK1 or CDH1 KD cells over 6 days ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2C ) . Both BRA and SOX9 were significantly increased on day three of KD in ROCK1 KD cells , however at day six the gene expression returned to levels comparable to day zero before ROCK1 KD . Although the CDH1 KD cells did not display any significant trends , the standard deviation of gene expression varied as much as three times greater than that of the ROCK1 KD cells . The high variation between biological replicates potentially indicates that silencing of CDH1 induces a large variability in the gene regulation of BRA and SOX9 and could indicate that the cells experience a transient fluctuation in the pluripotency state . However , these results indicate that the loss of ROCK1 or CDH1 is not sufficient to disrupt the pluripotent gene regulatory network and induce an immediate exit from the pluripotent state . Since pluripotency markers were maintained irrespective of mosaic patterning , gene expression changes in pluripotency markers ( SOX2 , NANOG ) , mesendoderm markers ( SOX17 , BRA ) and ectoderm markers ( PAX6 , SOX9 ) were examined during the course of mosaic patterning at days 1 , 3 and 6 after KD induction ( Figure 4A ) . To take into account potential gene expression changes that result from mixing hiPSC lines , un-induced mixed populations and un-induced pure populations were analyzed as controls . BRA did not change significantly with induction of ROCK1 KD or CDH1 KD in a mixed population , however SOX9 increased on day six of KD in both ROCK1 KD and CDH1 KD cells ( Figure 4C , D ) . Interestingly , similar to pure populations , there was a large variance in gene expression between biological replicates , often displaying more than a onefold change difference in gene expression between biological replicates in mixed colonies . To assess whether gene expression changes were unique to the induction of symmetry breaking events in mixed populations or simply a result of gene KD , a curated set of genes involved in pluripotent stem cell signaling , early lineage fate transitions , and regulation of physical cell properties ( Supplementary file 1 - Table 2 ) was examined in both pure KD populations and mixed KD populations . An ANOVA analysis was used to examine gene expression changes that could be attributed to mixing two different cell types ( mixed populations without KD ) , to KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 in a pure population , and to mosaic KD or KD in the presence of a WT neighbor ( Figure 4E , F ) . Overall , few changes in gene expression resulted from mixing un-induced CRISPRi populations with WT-GFP ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ) , and therefore all subsequent data were normalized to pure un-induced populations and then to mixed un-induced populations to minimize false positives that resulted from mixing of cell lines without induction of KD . In ROCK1 KD cells mixed with WT , the gene expression changes on day one that could be attributed solely to gene KD ( Figure 4E , left column ) were associated with primitive streak formation ( Snail ( SNAI1 ) , SMAD1 ) . On day three , an upregulation of adhesion molecules ( EPHA4 , ITGA4 ) was observed , as well as NANOG , Nestin ( NES ) , and TGFβ upregulation and FGFR2 down-regulation . Interestingly , a large number of changes in gene expression were specific to the mosaic induction of ROCK1 KD ( Figure 4E , right column ) , for example the down-regulation of both cell-cell adhesions as well as cell-ECM adhesions . Additionally , genes that were upregulated in the pure KD context were down-regulated in the mosaic KD context , such as SNAI1 , NES and NANOG . However , at day six of mosaic KD no significant changes persisted in the examined panel of genes ( Figure 4E ) . CDH1 KD caused an upregulation in genes associated with cell-cell adhesion on day one that was exacerbated in a mosaic CDH1 KD ( Figure 4F ) . Interestingly , both Wnt3 and down-stream Wnt targets , such as SNAI1 and SNAI2 , were significantly increased specifically in mosaic KDs on day one of KD . Similar to the transient wave of gene expression changes observed in ROCK1 KD cells , mosaic CDH1 KD did not exhibit any observed significant changes on day six of KD except for CDH1 ( Figure 4F ) . These results were consistent with our previous observation of the maintenance of pluripotency in the ROCK1 KD: WT-GFP and CDH1 KD: WT-GFP colonies ( Figure 3 ) . Furthermore , the recovery of homeostatic gene expression profiles closely followed the dynamics of distinct pattern establishment in the mixed populations . In addition to examining the KD cells , we examined the gene expression profiles of the neighboring WT cells that constituted the majority of cells in each colony . On day six of KD induction , the WT-GFP cells that were mixed with CDH1 KD hiPSCs had gene expression patterns that resembled the WT-GFP cells mixed with the control CRISPRi populations , whereas the WT-GFP cells mixed with ROCK1 KD hiPSCs exhibited a different expression profile . Interestingly , the WT-GFP cells mixed with ROCK1 CRISPRi hiPSCs demonstrated changes in genes associated with cell sorting and movement , such as ephrins and integrins , and up-regulation in myosin proteins ( MYH9 , MYH10 ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1B , C ) . Overall , the changes in the WT-GFP hiPSC gene expression suggests that targeted manipulation of gene expression in an emerging sub-population can exert non-cell–﻿autonomous effects on the opposing population and may be influenced by the respective multicellular organization of the two populations . Controllable induction of two distinct populations of hPSC offers the potential for co-emergence of multiple differentiated cell populations in a predictable manner . To examine how mosaic patterning of hPSC could direct co-emergence of differentiated progeny , two independent differentiation protocols were performed to direct the hiPSCs to either an ectodermal or mesendodermal fate ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2A ) . The proportion of PAX6 +cells , indicating neuro-ectoderm lineage , or eomesodermin ( EOMES ) +cells , indicating a mesendoderm lineage , in the WT and CRISPRi mixed populations were examined . Although the ROCK1 KD population did not display a significant difference in PAX6 +or EOMES +cells relative to the WT cells ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2B-D ) , the CDH1 KD population yielded fewer PAX6 +cells with the ectoderm directed differentiation and increased EOMES +cells in the mesendoderm-directed differentiation ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2B-D ) . Overall , these studies demonstrate the potent ability to direct multicellular organization of hPSCs prior to the acquisition of differentiated cell fate . 
 In this study we examined the effect of inducing specific genetic KD in subpopulations of hiPSCs within an otherwise homogeneous population of pluripotent cells . Historically , small-molecule chemical inhibitors , antibodies , and homogeneous genetic knockouts are often used to interrogate the molecular mechanisms involved in morphogenesis ( Lecuit and Lenne , 2007; McBeath et al . , 2004; Salbreux et al . , 2012 ) . However , these methods can’t selectively discriminate between different cells , or they fail to address how the emergence of heterotypic interactions affects multicellular organization . Here , we report that silencing of target genes by CRISPRi within only subpopulations of cells provides multiple avenues to genetically control the emergence of asymmetric cell phenotypes and development of multicellular patterns . Specifically , we demonstrate that mosaic KD of target genes ROCK1 or CDH1 result in distinct patterning events wherein cell-driven segregation dictates colony organization without loss of pluripotency ( Figure 5 ) . ROCK1 regulates actin-myosin contraction ( McBeath et al . , 2004 ) and facilitates expansion of PSCs ( Ohgushi et al . , 2015; Park et al . , 2015 ) , and its acute inhibition by small molecules leads to a ‘relaxed’ cell phenotype with decreased stiffness ( Kinney et al . , 2014; Lee et al . , 2006 ) . However , we found that prolonged silencing of ROCK1 in hiPSCs ( 6 days ) resulted in cells that were twofold stiffer than either the CDH1 KD cells or the control CRISPRi cells . The increased cortical stiffness of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs could be due to the difference between the inhibition of an existing protein and KD of the gene . A small molecule inhibitor prevents the function of already existing proteins so that a small amount of functioning protein may escape the inhibitor’s influence . In contrast , CRISPRi only needs to target the ROCK1 gene loci at two alleles to completely abolish protein transcription , thus highlighting the strength of genetic perturbation . Additionally , ROCK inhibition is often used as a transient perturbation ( 24 hr ) , whereas long-term KD of ROCK1 ( 6 days ) may induce compensatory effects within the cells that are responsible for the somewhat surprising results . Long-term ROCK1 KD compensation is a likely partial explanation why KD of ROCK1 prior to mixing resulted in radially partitioned populations , but post-mixing KD resulted in less segregated populations . The increased stacking of the ROCK1 KD population upon induction of knockdown after mixing with WT cells could also reflect the difference between short-term and long-term ROCK1 KD and potential compensation effects . For example , the 3D accumulation of ROCK1 KD cells as cytoskeletal contraction is impaired may be a result from compensatory contraction by the surrounding WT cells , resulting in multilayer colonies . The emergence of autonomous cell patterning and cell sorting is often coincident with the onset of differentiation , and CDH1 in particular regulates morphogenesis in a diverse range of species ( Burdsal et al . , 1993; Li et al . , 2010 ) . Historically , CDH1 is often associated with pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells ( Li et al . , 2012; Soncin and Ward , 2011 ) . However , while CDH1 is commonly expressed by pluripotent cells and CDH1 can replace OCT3/4 during fibroblast reprogramming to pluripotency ( Redmer et al . , 2011 ) , CDH1 is not essential to pluripotency ( Larue et al . , 1996; Soncin et al . , 2009; Ying et al . , 2008 ) . Our results reinforce these latter observations by demonstrating that CDH1 KD in hiPSCs does not adversely affect the expression of pluripotency markers nor lead to a loss of epithelial phenotype . The maintenance of pluripotent state indicates that KD of CDH1 alone is not sufficient to induce differentiation , but other factors such as sufficient cell density and local intercellular signaling preserve pluripotent colony integrity and buffer against changes in cell state . Furthermore , the observed maintenance of pluripotency and preferential differentiation to mesendoderm is consistent with recent studies revealing that changes in human CDH1 adhesions coordinate with in vitro human stem cell lineage decisions rather than pluripotency maintenance ( Przybyla et al . , 2016 ) . Changes in CDH1 influencing lineage fate decisions may explain the transient gene expression changes that we observed with the induction of KD in mixed colonies , where the loss of CDH1 potentially primes the cells to respond to a signal for differentiation , and without such a signal the cells return to a ground state of pluripotency . Similar priming has been described in the context of cell-matrix adhesion where differentiation in response to TGFβ signaling is primed by stiffness-dependent integrin signaling ( Allen et al . , 2012 ) ; a similar mechanism may explain the observed transient gene expression changes without loss of pluripotency in CDH1 KD hiPSCs . The ability to manipulate distinct cell populations allows for robust modeling of human morphogenic events and , thus , an expanded understanding of human biology that can be exploited to develop physiologically realistic in vitro human tissue models . Cellular location within pluripotent colonies can be thought to parallel the effects seen in early developing blastocysts . A cell’s location within the early embryo relays signals that dictate initial symmetry-breaking events , such as the decision to become trophectoderm instead of inner cell mass . Cells located within the center of an embryo maintain different adhesion contacts ( Stephenson et al . , 2010 ) and are subjected to higher tension generated by neighboring cells ( Samarage et al . , 2015 ) , which then feed back into lineage fate decisions . For example , the Hippo pathway is controlled by a cell’s position within the early blastocyst , where the outer cell layer has the ability to polarize and sequester the signaling molecule angiomotin away from adherens junctions , preventing the phosphorylation and activation that would occur in an internal cell that maintained cell-cell contacts on all sides ( Hirate et al . , 2013 ) . Additionally in vitro micro-patterned PSC colonies have been reported to display spatially dependent germ layer patterning upon differentiation ( Etoc et al . , 2016; Tewary et al . , 2017; Warmflash et al . , 2014 ) . The observed mosaic patterns of ROCK1 KD hiPSCs demonstrate that the spatial location within a colony can be affected by targeted gene KD without altering differentiation potential , and conversely , the mosaic CDH1 KD demonstrates dual control of spatial positioning and lineage potential . Therefore , the system described here enables interrogation of multicellular organization and morphogenic processes in parallel via manipulation of local multicellular domains through subpopulation organization and priming to specific lineage fates . In addition to changes in multicellular organization as a result of ROCK1 or CDH1 KD , changes in gene expression also occurred in the WT population . In particular , the WT population displayed significant changes in several genes associated with adhesion and lineage fate . For example , GATA4 was down-regulated in WT cells in all mixed colonies . GATA4 is expressed by mesendoderm lineages ( Molkentin et al . , 1997; Zorn and Wells , 2009 ) and its down-regulation may affect the ability of WT cells to properly differentiate to mesendoderm . However , there were no significant differences in EOMES expression between the WT and CRISPRi cells when ROCK1 KD mixed colonies were directed toward a mesendodermal fate ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) , potentially due to the strength of the small molecule CHIR , a GSK3 inhibitor , in inducing mesendoderm fate . Additionally , differences between the WT and ROCK1 KD populations may arise in longer differentiations , where the cells are allowed to mature beyond a progenitor stage . However , differences in maturation or cell type within a germ lineage may assist in the controlled co-emergence of multiple cell types that normally interact within a single tissue , such as parenchymal cells along with stromal populations . Overall , this study capitalized on the ability of CRISPRi to temporally perturb specific molecular regulators of physical cell properties , such as adhesion and tension , that resulted in differing multicellular patterns . Moreover , CRISPRi additionally offers the flexibility to target any gene of interest and timing of KD ( Gordon et al . , 2016; Mandegar et al . , 2016 ) , allowing for the creation of dynamic patterns through transient genetic KD that could be used to pre-pattern PSC colonies in various types of multicellular geometries before differentiation . Additionally , the ability to induce molecular asymmetry can also be applied to co-differentiation , where the temporal induction of specific heterotypic interactions , such as the presentation of a ligand or receptor , can give rise to the coordinated emergence of two ( or more ) cell types under the same culture conditions . In addition , mosaic induction of KD can be used to examine how signals propagate between cells , for example , interrogating how the networks between cells created by either mechanical ( adhesions ) or chemical gradients ( gap junctions ) affect lineage fate decisions . Furthermore , the predictable patterning events and potential for control over co-emergence that we establish in this study could aid the eventual control over morphogenic events in organoid systems . Organoids require coordinated heterotypic interactions in a 3D environment in order to self-organize ( Bredenoord et al . , 2017; Sasai , 2013 ) ; the ability to precisely predict and control the organization of multiple cell types in parallel would significantly improve the reproducibility and robustness of in vitro tissue modeling . Ultimately , this study identifies a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations to control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells , and subsequently facilitates the creation of robust models of morphogenesis necessary for the mechanistic study of human developmental tissue patterning and formation . 
 All work with hiPSC lines was approved by the University of California , San Francisco Human Gamete , Embryo and Stem Cell Research ( GESCR ) Committee . Human iPSC lines were derived from the WTC 11 line ( Coriell Cat . # GM25256 ) where the species of origin was confirmed by a LINE assay . After genetic manipulation , all cell lines were karyotyped by Cell Line Genetics and were deemed karyotypically normal before proceeding with experiments ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4B ) . All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma using a MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit ( Lonza ) . Human iPSC lines were cultured in feeder-free media conditions on growth factor-reduced Matrigel ( Corning Life Sciences ) and fed daily with mTeSRTM-1 medium ( STEMCELL Technologies ) ( Ludwig et al . , 2006 ) . Accutase ( STEMCELL Technologies ) was used to dissociate hiPSCs to single cells during passaging . Cells were passaged at a seeding density of 12 , 000 cells per cm2 and the small molecule Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase ( ROCK ) inhibitor Y-276932 ( 10 μM; Selleckchem ) was added to the media upon passaging to promote survival ( Park et al . , 2015; Watanabe et al . , 2007 ) . The generation of the ROCK1 CRISPRi line was previously created and described by Mandegar et al . , 2016 . For the generation of the CDH1 CRISPRi lines , five CRISPRi gRNAs were designed to bind within 150 bp of the TSS of CDH1 and cloned into the gRNA-CKB vector using BsmBI ligation following the previously described protocol ( Mandegar et al . , 2016 ) ( Supplementary file 1 -Table 1 ) . gRNA expression vectors were nucleofected into the CRISPRi-Gen1C human hiPSC line from the Conklin Lab using the Human Stem Cell Nucleofector Kit 1 solution with the Amaxa nucleofector 2b device ( Lonza ) . Nucleofected cells were seeded into 3 wells of a 6-well plate ( ~7400 cell/cm2 ) in mTeSRTM-1 media with Y-27632 ( 10 μM ) for 2 days , and treated with blasticidin ( ThermoFisher Scientific; 10 μg/ml ) for a selection period of 7 days . Surviving colonies were pooled and passaged in mTeSRTM-1 with blasticidin and Y-27632 for a single day then transitioned to mTeSRTM-1 media only . Once stable polyclonal populations of CDH1 CRISPRi hiPSCs for each of the five guides were established , the cells were incubated with doxycycline ( 2 μM ) for 96 hr . KD efficiency was evaluated by mRNA collection and subsequent qPCR , comparing levels of transcript with a time-matched control of the same line without CRISPRi induction . The CRISPRi CDH1 cell line with the guide producing the best KD was selected ( gRNA −6 ) . To generate the WT-GFP line , 2 million WTC clone11 hiPSCs were nucleofected as previously described with the knock-in plasmid containing a CAG promoter-driven EGFP and AAVS1 TALEN pair vectors ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4A ) . After cell recovery , puromycin ( 0 . 5 μg/ml ) was added to the media for a selection period of 7 days . Individual stable EGFP-expressing colonies were picked using an EVOS FL microscope ( Life Technologies ) and transferred to individual wells of a 24-well plate in mTeSR media with Y-27632 ( 10 μM ) and subsequently expanded into larger vessels . Cell aggregates of ~100 cells were created using 400 × 400 μm PDMS microwell inserts in 24-well plates ( ~975 microwell per well ) similar to previously published protocols ( Hookway et al . , 2016; Ungrin et al . , 2008 ) . Dissociated hiPSC cultures were resuspended in mTeSRTM-1 supplemented with Y-27632 ( 10 μM ) , mixed at proper ratios and concentration ( 100 cells/well ) , added to microwells , and centrifuged ( 200 rcf ) . After 18 hr of formation , 100 cell aggregates were transferred in mTeSRTM-1 to Matrigel-coated 96-well plates ( ~15 aggregates/cm2 ) and allowed to spread into 2D colonies . Human iPSCs were washed with cold PBS , incubated for 10 min on ice in RIPA Buffer ( Sigma-Aldrich ) , and supernatant collected . Three replicates were used for each condition . The supernatant protein content was determined using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit ( Thermofisher Scientific ) colorimetric reaction and quantified on a SpectraMax i3 Multi-Mode Platform ( Molecular Devices ) . Subsequently , 20 μg of protein from each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE , and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Invitrogen ) . The membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies: anti-ROCK1 ( AbCAM 1:200 ) , anti-CDH1 ( AbCAM 1:200 ) , anti-GAPDH , ( Invitrogen 1:10 , 000 ) , followed by incubation ( 30 min at room temperature ) with infrared secondary antibodies: IRDye 800CW and IRDye 680CW ( LI-COR 1:13 , 000 ) , and imaged on the Odyssey Fc Imaging System ( LI-COR Biosciences ) . Protein levels were quantified using Image Studio Lite ( LI-COR Biosciences ) . Total RNA isolation was performed using an RNeasy Mini Kit ( QIAGEN ) according to manufacturer’s instructions and quantified with a Nanodrop 2000c Spectrometer ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . cDNA was synthesized by using an iScript cDNA Synthesis kit ( BIORAD ) and the reaction was run on a SimpliAmp thermal cycler ( Life Technologies ) . To quantify individual genes , qPCR reactions were run on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system ( Applied Biosciences ) and detected using Fast SYBR Green Master Mix ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Relative gene expression was determined by normalizing to the housekeeping gene 18S rRNA , using the comparative threshold ( CT ) method . Gene expression was displayed as fold change of each sample ( ROCK1 CRISPRi or CDH1 CRISPRi ) versus the off-target guide control ( KCNH2 CRISPRi ) . The primers were designed using the NCBI Primer-BLAST website and are listed in Supplementary file 1 -Table 2 . Statistical analysis was conducted using a two-tailed unpaired t-test between any two groups ( p<0 . 05 , n = 3 ) . All AFM indentations were performed using an MFP3D-BIO inverted optical atomic force microscope ( Asylum Research ) mounted on a Nikon TE2000-U inverted fluorescent microscope . Silicon nitride cantilevers were used with spring constants ranging from 0 . 04 to 0 . 06 N/m and borosilicate glass spherical tips 5 µm in diameter ( Novascan Tech ) . Each cantilever was calibrated using the thermal oscillation method prior to each experiment . Samples were indented at 1 µm/s loading rate , with a maximum force of 4 nN . Force maps were typically obtained as a 6 × 6 raster series of indentations utilizing the FMAP function of the IGOR PRO build supplied by Asylum Research , for a total of 36 data points per area of interest measured every five microns . Two 5 micron by five micron areas of interest were sampled for each sample . The Hertz model was used to determine the elastic modulus of the sample at each point probed . Samples were assumed to be incompressible and a Poisson’s ratio of 0 . 5 was used in the calculation of the Young’s elastic modulus . Human iPSC colonies were imaged in 96-well plates ( ibidi ) on an inverted AxioObserver Z1 ( Ziess ) with an ORCA-Flash4 . 0 digital CMOS camera ( Hamamatsu ) . Using ZenPro software , colony locations were mapped and a single colony was imaged daily for 6 days . To obtain time-lapse movies , a single colony was imaged over the course of 12 hr at a rate of one picture taken every 30 min . Human iPSC colonies were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde ( VWR ) and washed 3X with PBS . Fixed colonies were permeabilized with 0 . 3% Trition X-100 ( Sigma Aldrich ) throughout blocking and antibody incubation steps . Samples were incubated in primary antibodies over night at 4°C , subsequently washed with PBS and incubated in secondary antibodies for an hour at room temperature . Primary antibodies used were: anti-OCT4 ( SantaCruz 1:400 ) , anti-SOX2 ( AbCAM 1:400 ) , anti-Zo1 ( LifeTechnologies 1:400 ) , NANOG ( AbCAM 1:300 ) , anti-β-catenin ( BD Biosciences 1:200 ) , anti-EpCAM ( Millipore 1:200 ) . All secondary antibodies were used at 1:1000 and purchased from Life Technologies . Pure populations of WT , CRISPRi KCNH2 ( control ) , CRISPRi ROCK1 , and CRISPRi CDH1 were treated with DOX ( 2 μM ) for 5 consecutive days . Cultures were pulsed with EdU by supplementing Click-It EdU ( 10 μM ) to the media for 6 hr . Cultures were then washed 3X with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde ( VWR ) for 15 min and subsequently washed with PBS . Samples were permeabilized with 0 . 5% Triton-X 100 ( Sigma Aldrich ) in PBS for 20 min . Samples were then incubated with Click-It EdU detection kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Samples were analyzed via flow cytometry on a BD LSR-FLOW Cytometer and analysis was performed with a minimum of 10 , 000 events . Mixed hiPSC populations and pure population controls were dissociated from tissue culture plates with Accutase ( STEMCELL Technologies ) and washed with PBS . Cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde ( VWR ) and washed 3X for 3 min with PBS . Samples were incubated in Hoescht stain ( 1:10 , 000 ) for 30 min and run on a LSR-II analyzer ( BD Biosciences ) to detect the ratio of WT-GFP ( + ) to CRISPRi mCherry ( + ) populations , as well as % of EdU +cells . Analysis was conducted with a minimum of 10 , 000 events per sample . Mixed hiPSC populations and pure population controls were dissociated from tissue culture plates and washed 3X with PBS . A LIVE/DEAD stain ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) was used per manufacture instructions . Prior to sorting , cells were suspended in PBS supplemented with Y-27632 ( 10 μM ) and kept on ice . A BD FACSAria II cell sorter ( BD Biosciences ) was used to isolate pure populations of WT-GFP and CRISPRi hiPSCs by first identifying the live cells via the LIVE/DEAD ( 350 ) stain and subsequently sorting the mCherry ( + ) GFP ( - ) populations from the mCherry ( - ) GFP ( + ) populations directly into TRIzol LS Reagent ( ThermoFisher Scientifc ) . Samples were then stored at −80°C until subsequent mRNA extraction . Sorted hiPSCs stored in TRIzol LS were thawed on ice and mRNA was extracted using a Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Plus kit ( ZYMO Research ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . RNA was converted to cDNA using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit ( Bio-Rad ) . Forward and reverse primers for genes were designed using NCBI’s Primer-BLAST ( Supplementary file 1 - Table 3 ) . Primers were pooled to 500 nM to enable specific-target amplification and cDNA was amplified with PreAmp Master Mix ( Fluidigm ) and pooled primers for 15 cycles . Pre-amplified samples mixed with 2X SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix with low ROX ( Bio-Rad ) and 20X DNA Binding Dye Sample Loading Reagent ( Fluidigm ) , and 10 μM primer sets were mixed with 2X Assay Loading Reagent ( Fluidigm ) . 5 μl of diluted cDNA and primers and were loaded onto the IFC chip per manufacturer’s instructions and loaded into the chip using the IFC Controller HX ( Fluidigm ) . qPCR was run for 40 cycles in the IFC chip using the BioMark HD in the BioMark HD Data Collection Software . Resulting data was analyzed in the Real-Time PCR Analysis Software . All instruments and software involved with the IFC chip were manufactured by Fluidigm . Gene expression levels were calculated with respect to time-matched pure populations of WT hiPSCs , and hierarchically clustered and plotted using Genesis software ( Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics , Graz University of Technology ) . For the dual SMAD and CHIR germ lineage differentiations , 100 cell mixed colonies were generated as previously described , cultured in mTeSRTM-1 medium ( STEMCELL Technologies ) , and allowed to form patterns for 5 days in pluripotency maintenance conditions . After 5 days , the media was supplemented with either SB 435142 ( 10μM; Stemgent ) and LDN 193189 ( 0 . 2μM; Sigma-Aldrich ) or CHIR 99021 ( 12μM; Selleckchem ) . CHIR was pulsed for 24 hr periods on the first and fourth day of the mesendoderm directed differentiation . Dual SMAD inhibition was kept constant for 6 days by supplementing SB 435142 and LDN 193189 into MTeSR media to direct germ lineage to an ectodermal fate . After 6 days of differentiation , colonies were washed 3X with PBS and fixed for staining with 4% paraformaldehyde ( VWR ) as previously described . For the radial position computational analysis , fluorescent images were split into single RGB channel images using the Python module scikit-image ( scikit-image contributors et al . , 2014 ) where the red channel denoted CRISPRi cells , the green channel denoted WT cells , and the blue channel denoted DAPI staining of the entire colony . A mask of each channel was created by thresholding , removing small objects , and removing small holes . The radius ( r ) of each colony was calculated using the DAPI mask and the ratio of inner red cell area vs . outer red cell area was calculated by taking the logical AND of the red channel mask and the DAPI mask above ¾ r vs the logical AND of the red channel mask and the DAPI mask below ¼ r and normalizing to the total red mask area . To ensure accuracy , the inner vs . outer red ratio was averaged with the inverse of the inner vs . outer green ratio ( calculated in the same manner using the green channel mask ) . For the differentiation analysis , fluorescent images were split into single RGB channels where the red channel denoted CRISPRi cells ( mCherry+ ) , the green channel denoted WT cells ( GFP+ ) , and the blue channel denoted either PAX6 or EOMES positive cells . The pixel area of cell types was determined by thresholding the WT , CRISPRi , or EOMES/PAX6 +images before ‘removing small objects’ and ‘removing small holes’ to create a mask of the area covered by each individual cell type . The EOMES or PAX6 +population was calculated by taking the logical AND of either the WT and EOMES/PAX6 +mask or the CRISPRi and the EOMES/PAX6 +masks and then normalizing to the total area of the WT or CRISPRi mask , respectively . The ratio of EOMES/PAX6 +cells in CRISPRi cell compared to WT was calculated by dividing the normalized EOMES/PAX6 +area of the CRISPRi mask by the normalized EOMES/PAX6 +area of the WT mask . To ensure unbiased sampling of colonies in all cell mixing experiments , 10 colonies were randomly chosen on day zero before pattern formation and imaged daily thereafter . Each experiment was performed with at least three biological replicates . Unpaired T-tests were used to compare two groups . One-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was used to compare three or more groups , followed by post-hoc pairwise comparisons by Tukey’s tests . In gene expression analysis , three replicates were used for each condition , and all gene expression was normalized to control mixed populations ( off-target guide without knockdown ) to control for any gene expression changes due to mixing or the process of FACS sorting . In all comparisons , significance was specified as p≤0 . 05 .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['stem cells and regenerative medicine', 'developmental biology']",elife-36045-v1,90,8271,8181,91.9
14,"This text describes novel, highly engineered biomimetics systems capable  of replicately reproducing pathophysiology. It highlights potential therapeutic interventions targeting pathways implicated therein alongside challenges faced whilst attempting replication outside animal subjects' natural states   The manuscript presents original finding regarding interactions among various physical forces acting concurrently against mammalian fibroblast behaviour towards creating new avenues toward treating diseases characterized primarily relatedness poor wound closure but offers valuable insight pertaining metabolic homeostasis maintenance balance achieved thanks partially owing resilience displayed earlier stages pathology leading ultimately impacting organ transplantation procedures aimed improving outcomes despite limitations inherent risks intrinsic nature surrounding chronic illness progression hence highlighting importance accurate timing intervention tailored therapies addressing underlying processes governing abnormal deposition patterns seen clinical manifestations arising outgrowths damaged hearts undergoing treatment modalities intended mitigating complications stemming directly proportional damage sustained viability compromised individuals suffering cardiovascular disorders like cancer,.","When the supply of oxygen to the heart is reduced , its cells start to die within hours , the heart muscle becomes less able to contract , and the area becomes inflamed . This inflammation is accompanied by an influx of immune cells . It also activates other cells known as cardiac fibroblasts that help to break down the framework of molecules that supported the damaged heart tissue and replace it with a scar . This response is part of the normal repair process , but it can lead to the formation of scar tissue in non-damaged areas of the heart . Excess scar tissue makes the heart muscle less able to contract and increases the affected individual’s chance of dying . Understanding how this repair process works is an important step in developing strategies to minimise the damage caused by coronary artery disease or heart attacks . However , existing laboratory models are only partly able to recreate the conditions seen in real heart tissue . To properly understand the response at the level of living cells , a more complete model is needed . Ugolini et al . now report improvements to a small device , referred to as a lab-on-chip , that can subject cells to mechanical strain . The improvements mean the device could also recreate other conditions seen early on in damaged heart tissue , specifically the reduced supply of oxygen . Replicating combinations of mechanical changes and oxygen supplies meant that the impact of these conditions on human cardiac fibroblasts could be directly observed in the laboratory for the first time . Ugolini et al . found that a lack of contraction and low oxygen levels triggered the cardiac fibroblasts to produce inflammatory molecules and molecules associated with the formation of scar tissue . This resembles the response seen in living hearts . The next step is to improve the lab-on-chip device further by adding other cell types , including heart muscle cells and immune cells . A more complete model may aid future research into how our hearts operate in both health and disease .","Upon cardiac pathological conditions such as ischemia , microenvironmental changes instruct a series of cellular responses that trigger cardiac fibroblasts-mediated tissue adaptation and inflammation . A comprehensive model of how early environmental changes may induce cardiac fibroblasts ( CF ) pathological responses is far from being elucidated , partly due to the lack of approaches involving complex and simultaneous environmental stimulation . Here , we provide a first analysis of human primary CF behavior by means of a multi-stimulus microdevice for combined application of cyclic mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension . Our findings elucidate differential human CFs responses to different combinations of the above stimuli . Individual stimuli cause proliferative effects ( PHH3+ mitotic cells , YAP translocation , PDGF secretion ) or increase collagen presence . Interestingly , only the combination of hypoxia and a simulated loss of contractility ( 2% strain ) is able to additionally induce increased CF release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases . 
 When supply of oxygen and nutrients to the myocardium is critically reduced ( ischemia ) , a complex tissue response takes place: within hours tissue necrosis and death of contractile cardiac myocytes occurs in the infarcted area giving rise to an inflammatory phase that recruits immune cells and activates quiescent cardiac fibroblasts ( CFs ) ; within a few days a proliferative phase begins , where activated CFs invade the infarcted area and contribute to degrading and replacing the extra-cellular matrix with a collagen-based scar; within weeks the maturation of the fibrotic scar is completed ( Frangogiannis , 2014; Heusch et al . , 2014 ) . Cellular and molecular events such as excessive proliferation of CFs , phenotypic switch of CFs , high levels of inflammatory cytokines and humoral factors , unbalanced synthesis of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins and matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP ) -mediated degradation of ECM are generally regarded as hallmarks of early fibrotic tissue response ( Fan et al . , 2012; Krenning et al . , 2010; Porter and Turner , 2009; Shinde and Frangogiannis , 2014 ) . This essential process maintains tissue integrity , however , it often leads to excessive and adverse CFs remodeling of non-infarcted areas ( Fan et al . , 2012; Kania et al . , 2009; Talman and Ruskoaho , 2016 ) associated with cardiac dysfunction and increased mortality ( Okada et al . , 2005 ) . Controlled anti-fibrotic strategies still require deeper understanding and advanced models of cardiac fibrosis mechanisms ( Leask , 2010; Roubille et al . , 2014 ) . In general , the onset of pathological myocardial conditions causes alterations of specific environmental cues at the cellular scale: mechanical strain decreases ( loss of contractility ) ; oxygen and nutrient levels dramatically decrease ( ischemia ) ; levels of inflammatory cytokines increase ( post-injury inflammatory response ) . In an attempt to provide in vitro models of cardiac disease , CFs have been widely studied under relevant physico-chemical stimulation such as mechanical stress ( Schroer and Merryman , 2015; Tomasek et al . , 2002 ) , oxygen deprivation ( Clancy et al . , 2007; Tamamori et al . , 1997 ) and biochemical stimulation with pro-fibrotic cytokines ( Edgley et al . , 2012; Lijnen et al . , 2000; Petrov et al . , 2002 ) . The application of mechanical stress has been shown to have the following effects on CFs: increased ECM protein synthesis ( Carver et al . , 1991 ) ; controversial proliferative behavior ( Atance et al . , 2004; Butt and Bishop , 1997; Dalla Costa et al . , 2010; Liao et al . , 2004 ) , with recent reports of strain intensity-dependent effects ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) ; increased production of pro-fibrotic and inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β ( transforming growth factor-beta ) ( Leask , 2007 ) and TNF-α ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha ) ( Yokoyama et al . , 1999 ) . While previous mechanical stress experiments were performed in a normoxic environment ( NX , approximately 20% O2 , the standard oxygen level of ambient air ) , CFs were shown to be sensitive to O2 level variations from physoxia ( PX ) , defined as the physiologic oxygen level in living tissues ( about 5–6% O2 in the myocardium [Gonschior et al . , 1992; Roy et al . , 2003; Sen et al . , 2006; Winegrad et al . , 1999] ) . Both hypoxia ( HX , 1–3% O2 ) and NX induce a pro-inflammatory and fibrogenic phenotype in cultured CFs ( Roy et al . , 2003; Sen and Roy , 2010 ) . These findings imply that normoxic oxygen levels are perceived by CFs as a state of hyperoxia and that a significant bias exists when culturing CFs in non-physiological oxygen environments . The exposure of CFs to HX has been shown to induce collagen production and proliferation of CFs ( Gao et al . , 2014; Tamamori et al . , 1997 ) , while studies suggest that MMP-based remodeling may not be triggered by HX alone ( Riches et al . , 2009 ) . Given the complexity of in vivo pathological evolution , the elucidation of how environmental stimuli interplay and guide cellular responses is paramount . To date , no comprehensive model is able to recapitulate early cellular events taking place after acute myocardial injury and there is no report of cardiac cells subjected to simultaneous mechanical strain and controlled oxygen changes , two major environmental variables involved in cardiac injury and CF adaptive responses . This is mostly due to the lack of compact platforms enabling the controlled application of multiple stimuli . To address this need , we here report the improvement of a previously described multi-chamber microdevice dedicated to the application of cyclic strain to cell monolayers ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) . By adding a system for controlling oxygen changes , we significantly expanded the experimental complexity and mimicking capabilities of the device . We here finely controlled the applied mechanical strain and oxygen regimes sensed by CFs to model early environmental changes in cardiac injury and provide insights into individual or synergistic contributions of the environmental signals in the activation of early CF responses relevant to cardiac fibrotic disease . Shortly after an ischemic myocardial insult ( e . g . , acute coronary artery occlusion ) tissue oxygen levels drop from approximately 5–6% O2 ( Gonschior et al . , 1992; Sen et al . , 2006; Winegrad et al . , 1999 ) to near-zero ( Roy et al . , 2003 ) , rapidly inducing loss of cardiac myocytes contractility . In terms of in vitro model parameters , we thus selected 5% O2 ( PX ) as a physiological oxygen level and 1% O2 ( HX ) as an oxygen level characteristic of ischemic myocardial injury . Dramatic alterations of injured myocardial tissue also take place in early timeframes: tissue bulging and dilations are commonly observed together with loss of contractile function ( Eek et al . , 2010; Pfeffer and Braunwald , 1990; Picard et al . , 1990; Tennant and Wiggers , 1935 ) . Cardiac imaging studies agree in the interpretation that global strains are abruptly reduced shortly after myocardial insult ( Flachskampf et al . , 2011; Hoit , 2011; Mollema et al . , 2010 ) . Quantitatively , strain values recorded vary significantly throughout the heart . Although absolute values may depend on imaging algorithms , strains in ischemic/injured regions have been reported to be 2–4 fold lower than in healthy myocardial regions ( e . g . less than 3% in ischemic regions versus approximately 10% in healthy regions [Dandel et al . , 2009; Vartdal et al . , 2007] ) . Within this range and in line with previous in vitro observations of CFs behavior ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) , we selected 2% strain as indicative of reduced contractility and 8% strain as representative of full myocardial contractility . These environmental changes and the following initial cellular responses happen in a timeframe of hours , as shown in vitro ( van Nieuwenhoven et al . , 2013; Turner et al . , 2007 , 2009 ) as well as in vivo ( Guillén et al . , 1995; Morishita et al . , 2015 ) . We thus performed experiments lasting 24 hr and evaluated the main early aspects that govern fibrotic responses in the injured myocardium: ECM remodeling , with stainings for collagen I and quantifications of MMP expression; proliferation of CFs , with analyses of mitotic cells , Hippo pathway signaling and mitogenic PDGF ( platelet-derived growth factor ) expression; secretion of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines in CF supernatants; myofibroblast differentiation , through stainings for αSMA ( α-smooth muscle actin ) . Results of our investigation provide insights into how the combination of environmental stimuli may act synergistically or independently to drive in vitro adaptive early CF responses . 
 Myocardial pathological remodeling is largely based on unbalanced CF production of collagen I and MMP-mediated matrix remodeling . To analyze CF-mediated early remodeling events under combined stimulations , we analyzed immunofluorescence images of CFs stained for collagen I . In addition , we quantified the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-3 in cell culture supernatants , two enzymes specifically expressed by CFs during cardiac remodeling ( Fan et al . , 2012 ) . While CFs normally exhibit diffuse cytoplasmic staining for collagen I , an intense staining localized to perinuclear regions of CFs was observed after 24 hr under specific stimulations ( Figure 1A ) . Based on analysis of intracellular fluorescence intensity , we found that the increase in collagen I was similarly triggered by HX alone and 8% strain alone ( Figure 1B ) . No significant synergy was found for the two stimulations: levels of collagen I are similarly elevated in all HX conditions regardless of strain applied . Correspondingly , collagen I staining exhibits similar intensity in all 8% strain conditions regardless of the oxygen stimulation employed . After only 12 hr of stimulation , collagen I fluorescence showed similar trends , with the exception of HX combined with 8% cyclic strain which provided a greater synergistic effect compared to the single stimulations ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . We also report that culturing CFs at NX levels does not induce significant changes in collagen I presence . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 005 The expression of MMP-2 and MMP-3 in CFs supernatants ( Figure 1CD ) was significantly influenced by combined mechanical strain and oxygen changes . MMP-2 was more prominently expressed than MMP-3 ( >100X higher ) . Nevertheless , the expression of both enzymes was similarly regulated by the pattern of stimulations applied: a significant two-fold increase in MMP-2 and MMP-3 expression was induced by the combination of HX and mechanical strain , with a more pronounced increase observed in the HX/2% strain combined conditions . MMP-3 expression was negatively affected when CFs were subjected to mechanical strain at PX or HX stimulus alone . During the proliferative phase of myocardial healing , excessive CF proliferation is observed as well as a phenotypic switch giving rise to the fibrotic response . In order to understand how environmental stimuli modulate the proliferation of human CFs , we examined the fraction of mitotic cells ( PHH3+/DAPI ) under combined mechanical stimulation and changes in oxygen tension . Figure 2A shows representative images of CFs stained for PHH3 and DAPI . Without application of cyclic strain , we observed a two-fold significant increase in the number of mitotic cells ( Figure 2B ) when CFs were stimulated with HX compared to their PX counterparts . Mechanical strain significantly impacted cell proliferation within the PX culture condition: culturing CFs at PX and subjecting them to 2% strain induced a striking increase in mitotic cells compared to no strain control and 8% strain cultures . This strain intensity-dependent effect is in line with our previous investigations of CF proliferation under mechanical strain in NX conditions ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) . After 12 hr of stimulation , the proliferative increase with HX is not statistically significant , while we report a significant synergistic decrease of mitotic cells induced by the combination of 8% strain and HX ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 006Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 008 In addition , we performed mitotic cell counts on CFs cultured under NX conditions without mechanical strain in order to evaluate any influence of non-physiological oxygen environments on CF proliferation . Interestingly , CFs exhibited much greater mitosis under NX environments ( approx . 5% mitotic cells ) compared to PX environments ( approx . 1% mitotic cells ) denoting a strong proliferative effect of standard cell culture environments . Further , we evaluated the effects of the environmental changes on YAP , a transcription factor mainly known as the principal effector of the Hippo proliferative pathway , a crucial pathway involved in cardiac regeneration and repair ( Papizan and Olson , 2014; Xin et al . , 2013 ) . Recent literature has also described a parallel mechano-sensing associated role of YAP ( Dupont et al . , 2011; Mosqueira et al . , 2014 ) . YAP translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus leads to inactivation of Hippo pathway and a subsequent increase in cell proliferation . We therefore quantified nuclear localization of YAP by means of immunofluorescence , which revealed that the fraction of CFs displaying nuclear YAP is influenced by the combination of stimuli with trends similar to the fraction of mitotic cells ( Figure 2C , D ) . In CFs cultured at PX , 2% strain induces higher YAP translocation into cell nuclei . CFs solely exposed to HX environment show a significant two-fold increase in nuclear YAP compared to a PX environment . Mechanical strain shows a negative interaction when combined with HX , with CFs subject to HX/8% strain condition showing lower fractions of nuclear YAP compared to CFs subject to HX alone . This effect can also be observed in the analysis of mitotic cells , although the result is not statistically significant . Interestingly , CFs cultured in an NX environment show a three-fold increase in nuclear YAP compared to PX conditions . Finally , we detected the expression of PDGF in CF supernatants . PDGF has been described as a potent mitogen for CFs , is significantly over-expressed in in vivo models of heart injury ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) , and has recently been studied as a putative pharmacological target for attenuating adverse effects of cardiac fibrotic disease ( Liu et al . , 2014 ) . Expression of PDGF in CF culture supernatant ( Figure 2E ) was significantly affected by HX stimulation: a four-fold increase in the detected amounts of PDGF was observed in HX compared to PX , without application of cyclic strain . Mechanical stimulation showed a negative interaction with the HX-induced secretion of PDGF: while levels of PDGF expression remain elevated under HX/2% strain , application of 8% cyclic strain shows a negative regulation of PDGF secretion back to PX levels of expression . Acute inflammatory tissue responses after myocardial injuries are thought to be largely based on cellular signaling by means of secreted factors . The precise contribution of CFs in the regulation of the early inflammatory response in myocardial remodeling is still to be determined , however , recent reports suggest that CFs play a key role in modulating a functional inflammasome that includes inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines ( Kawaguchi et al . , 2011; Lindner et al . , 2014; Turner , 2016 ) . We therefore studied the amount of inflammatory cytokines ( namely interleukins IL-1β , IL-6 and TNF-α ) and of pro-fibrotic TGF-β in CF culture supernatants after 24 hr of combined stimulations ( Figure 3 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 009Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 010 TGF-β is a major contributor to fibrotic responses , widely studied across a variety of tissues and organs . During post-injury myocardial remodeling , TGF-β is known to stimulate a wide range of CF responses from phenotypic switch to collagen synthesis and ECM remodeling ( Leask , 2007 ) . CFs stimulated with a combination of HX and mechanical strain ( specifically 2% strain ) were found to increase secretion of TGF-β by approximately two-fold . CFs cultured at PX expressed lower amounts of TGF-β , regardless of the mechanical strain applied ( Figure 3A ) . IL1-β is one of the first cytokines detected in vivo after myocardial injury ( Guillén et al . , 1995 ) and is known to stimulate CF response including the production of MMPs ( Brown et al . , 2007; Guo et al . , 2008; Siwik et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , we found that a significant two-fold increase in IL1-β expression occurred only when CFs were subjected to the combination of HX and mechanical strain , particularly with 2% strain ( Figure 3B ) . Conversely , we observed how the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 was not influenced by the application of environmental stimuli . We detected extremely low amounts of TNF-α ( Figure 3C ) , with non-significant variations across all stimulation conditions . IL-6 ( Figure 3D ) was abundantly expressed by CFs yet none of the differences in its expression were found to be statistically significant . In the remodeling myocardium , CFs undergo a phenotypic modulation to myofibroblasts , a motile and contractile cell type that maintains tissue integrity and promotes scar formation and tissue fibrosis ( Santiago et al . , 2010 ) . The hallmark of this phenotype switch is the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin ( αSMA ) that , by being incorporated into actin stress fibers , confers increased mechanical and motile capabilities to differentiated myofibroblasts ( Baum and Duffy , 2011 ) . To analyze whether CFs differentiation into myofibroblasts took place under environmental changes we evaluated expression and localization of αSMA after 24 hr of combined stimulation . Immunostainings of CFs ( Figure 4 ) reveal that a basal expression of cytoplasmic αSMA is present in all combined stimulation conditions . However , under no experimental condition did CFs exhibit co-localization of αSMA ( red ) and actin stress fibers ( green ) , indicating that differentiation into myofibroblasts was not induced by our pattern of environmental stimuli . Conversely , stimulating CFs by supplementing TGF-β in the culture medium ( a known inducer of CF differentiation to myofibroblasts ) caused the appearance of cells exhibiting superimposed αSMA and actin signal ( yellow ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 011Figure 4 .

 In summary , we propose an innovative model that recreates a pathological environment for understanding CF responses during cardiac injury . Replicating for the first time the combination of oxygen changes and mechanical cues , we revealed how these environmental stimulations combine to trigger CF pathological responses and highlighted emerging adaptive cellular mechanisms . We found that mimicking the combination of HX and reduced contractility proved crucial in eliciting inflammatory and fibrotic remodeling responses of CFs , while individual environmental stimuli only regulated proliferative and collagen-related responses . These insights have impact on future studies of pathological myocardial remodeling and the in vitro model here described provides a tool for better understanding pathological mechanisms and tailoring reparative strategies . 
 Figure 5 shows a detailed representation of oxygen dynamics and mechanical strain conditions employed ( Figure 5A and B ) together with a timeline of experiments ( Figure 5C ) . After cells seeding , CFs were kept in static incubation for 12 hr in order to allow for cell adhesion . Subsequently – being this initial time-point referred to as t0 – CFs seeded in the inlet and outlet wells of the culture chambers were manually scraped , aspirated and stimulations were started . We employed two mechanical stimulation regimes ( Figure 5B ) : 2% strain or 8% strain at 1 Hz . Concerning the oxygenation stimulus applied , the microdevices were employed at a base environmental oxygen level corresponding to physoxia ( 5% O2 ) in order to precisely model the oxygen levels in healthy myocardium until t0 . Then , two oxygen concentration dynamics were imposed ( Figure 5C ) : ( i ) a static incubation at 5% O2 ( physoxia , PX ) for 24 hr , ( ii ) an abrupt reduction of oxygen concentrations to 1% O2 that was maintained for 24 hr ( hypoxia , HX ) . CFs were subject to all possible combinations of the above stimuli ( six total conditions ) for a total of 24 hr . Immunofluorescence analyses were performed after 12 hr and 24 hr of stimulation , while cell culture supernatants were collected and analyzed after 24 hr of stimulation . Immunofluorescence analyses were also performed on CFs cultured at NX levels under 0% strain condition to investigate responses induced by culturing CFs in non-physiological NX environments , a standard condition for most previous studies on CFs . 10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 015Figure 5 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 22847 . 018 The microdevice was fabricated as previously described ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) . Briefly , four stretching units are arranged in a single device composed of a thin polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) membrane sandwiched between two microstructured PDMS layers . Figure 5—figure supplement 1 shows a picture of the microdevice together with a sketched cross-section of a stretching unit of the device . In each stretching unit , a central culture chamber ( blue ) is flanked by two actuation chambers ( red ) connected to a single actuation line , meant for vacuum application and straining of the central membrane . A lower fluidic channel ( green ) , common to all units , is designed for environmental conditioning and flows below each central culture chamber . Figure 5—figure supplement 1 also shows the stimulation system: microdevices were actuated by a vacuum line for generating mechanical strain and a gas line for controlling oxygen concentrations . As for the vacuum line , programmable electromechanical valves modulated the vacuum to switch cyclically from atmospheric pressure to the desired vacuum pressure ( namely −200 mmHg for 2% strain and −600 mmHg for 8% strain , applied for half a cycle at a rate of 1 Hz ) . The pneumatic stretch system was previously described and validated ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) . The flowrate of humidified gas mixture ( 95% N2; 5% CO2 ) was regulated with a flowmeter and delivered to the microdevices through low-permeability gas tubing . Numerical modeling and experimental characterization of the oxygen control system is described in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 . Numerical models of a 2D cross-section of the microdevice culture chamber show that the spatial distribution of oxygen tension is uniform along the width of the culture membrane , with limited border effect near the side walls ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2A , B ) . We employed a needle-based , fine-tip ( spatial resolution ≈ 50 µm ) oxygen sensor adjusted with a micromanipulator ( PreSens , Germany ) to reach the culture membrane . Measured oxygen concentration values confirm that the culture membrane is conditioned to ≈1% O2 at varying flowrates and consistently throughout all four culture chambers ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2C , D ) . The low-oxygen conditioning occurs within seconds , while reoxygenation occurs within minutes ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2E ) . Membrane strains upon application of varying gas flowrates were measured as previously described ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) . Gas flowrates of 5 ml/min and 15 ml/min do not cause significant membrane strain ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2F ) . Normal human ventricular cardiac fibroblasts from one donor were purchased from Lonza ( Lonza Bioscience , Singapore ) . Cells were cultured in FGM-3 medium ( Lonza Bioscience , Singapore ) and in a humidified incubator at 90% N2 , 5% O2 , 5% CO2 at all times unless otherwise indicated . Microdevices were autoclave-sterilized , plasma-treated and coated with human fibronectin ( Sigma-Aldrich , Singapore ) for 30 min at room temperature . Cells were seeded for experiments at a passage number of four . After pre-loading each culture chamber of the microdevices with 80 µl of medium , 20 µl of cell suspension ( 106 cells/ml ) were manually injected in the wells of the culture chambers . During experiments , microdevices were kept in humidified chambers to avoid culture medium evaporation . Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min . After 15 min of permeabilization with PBS containing 0 . 5% Triton-X , cells were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin . Cells were then probed overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies: anti-collagen I ( mouse , AbCam , UK; RRID:AB_305411 ) , to identify alterations in collagen I in the culture; anti-phospho-Histone-H3 ( PHH3 , Ser10 , rabbit , Santa-Cruz , US; RRID:AB_2233067 ) , for mitotic cells; anti-YAP ( rabbit , Santa-Cruz , US; RRID:AB_2273277 ) to localize nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of the YAP/TAZ complex , a mechano-sensing associated transcription factor and main effector of the Hippo proliferative pathway; anti-αSMA ( Smooth Muscle Actin , rabbit , AbCam , UK; RRID:AB_2223021 ) to identify myofibroblast differentiation from expression and localization of αSMA . CFs cultured under standard culture medium supplemented with 30 ng/ml TGF-β ( Sigma-Aldrich , Singapore ) were considered positive controls for αSMA stainings . The following secondary antibodies were used for 2 hr at room temperature: goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 564 ( AbCam , UK ) . Nuclear staining was performed by incubating cells with DAPI . Negative controls were present for all immunofluorescence stainings . Images were acquired with a Zeiss 710 Confocal microscope . Imaging parameters were not changed during acquisitions . For quantitative analyses of immunofluorescence markers , three images per culture chamber were taken at 10X magnification , thus sampling roughly half of the total area of the culture membrane and screening about 500 cells per replicate . Images were acquired from the central region of the culture membrane . Collagen I analyses were performed by intracellular fluorescence intensity quantification: the intracellular integrated density parameter was calculated by manually drawing outlines of about 50 cells per replicate from images , correcting for background intensity and normalizing for cell area . Cell proliferation analyses were performed by manually counting nuclei positive for PHH3 and dividing by the total number of nuclei ( automatically counted ) to estimate the fraction of mitotic cells . YAP localization analyses were performed by manually discriminating cytoplasmic or nuclear staining as previously described ( Codelia et al . , 2014; Dupont et al . , 2011 ) and dividing by the total number of nuclei ( automatically counted ) to estimate the level of YAP nuclear translocation . A volume of culture medium ( 100 µl ) was collected per each culture chamber from the microfluidic devices after 24 hr . Supernatants were stored at −80°C prior to analysis . Residual cells and debris in the supernatant were removed by centrifugation . Concentrations of secreted factors in the supernatants were assessed via multiplex bead-based array according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Luminex , Austin , TX ) . Each measurement was run in duplicate . All data are presented as mean ± SD . Statistical comparisons were performed using GraphPad ( Prism ) software . All data were initially analyzed for normality using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests . Two-way ANOVA tests followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests were applied to determine statistical significance of differences and evaluate synergistic or separate contribution of mechanical strain stimulation and oxygen dynamics stimulation . When data groups did not pass normality tests , non-parametric statistical tests were employed ( Kruskal-Wallis test ) . A p-value lower than 0 . 05 was considered significant . All data were collected from a pool of six independent experiments with a minimum number of biological replicates of four . We designed the approximate sample size required for the study by performing power analysis based on previously reported data on human cardiac fibroblasts ( CF ) proliferative responses under mechanical strain ( Ugolini et al . , 2016 ) . In addition , we considered preliminary data obtained from human CFs cultured at different oxygen levels . An effect size was computed from this data ( fraction of mitotic PHH3+ cells under 2% vs . 8% strain: 2 . 0 ± 0 . 5 vs . 0 . 5 ± 0 . 3; expression of MMPs at physoxia vs . hypoxia: 1 . 02 ± 0 . 2 vs . 2 . 00 ± 0 . 1 ng/ml ) .

Here they find evidence indicating osmoreceptors convey much faster alterations occurring across odors rather slow variations like those arising naturally given volatile chemical kinetics involving diffusive spreading processes characteristic euglenoid algae blooms known commonly referred river pollution events (""red tide"") affecting coastal ecosystems worldwide.. They discovered similar coding strategies occur irrespective if behavioral relevance exists – highlighting evolutionary conservation among diverse species despite ecological differences amongst them,. Their results suggest Acceleration Coding serves several purposes : guiding organisms towards sources quickly evolving odour landscapes common place amidst environmental challenges faced daily ; aiding navigation tactics utilized against predators seeking prey,; facilitating avoidance mechanisms deployed versus toxic substances potentially enhancing survival chances particularly beneficial considering limited visual cues available whilst navigating intricate terrain conditions typical foraging scenarios frequently encounter.<br>    Key Findings:<ol><li>- Osnilar receptor networks transform static pheromone pulses delivered onto receptive fields accurately reflecting instantaneous speed modulation inherent volatils.</ li></ul>. </p/>     The key takeaways include:<nl>(•) Sensory Processing Beyond Detection--Odor sensing involves extracting multiple aspects besides just identifying compounds present.(NL)(♦️)<BR>()(○)>Insects exploit accelerations encoded prior reaching targets allowing quick adjustments minimizing travel distances.&nbsp;(★)&lt;-&gt;, accelerating movement away form danger.)</span>,","Fruit flies are attracted to the smell of rotting fruit , and use it to guide them to nearby food sources . However , this task is made more challenging by the fact that the distribution of scent or odor molecules in the air is constantly changing . Fruit flies therefore need to cope with , and exploit , this variation if they are to use odors as cues . Odor molecules bind to receptors on the surface of nerve cells called olfactory sensory neurons , and trigger nerve impulses that travel along these cells . The olfactory sensory neurons are connected to other cells called projection neurons that in turn relay information to the higher centers of the brain . While many studies have investigated how fruit flies can distinguish between different odors , less is known about how animals can use variation in the strength of an odor to guide them towards its source . Kim et al . have now addressed this question by devising a method for delivering precise quantities of odors in controlled patterns to fruit flies , and then measuring the responses of olfactory sensory neurons and projection neurons . These experiments revealed that olfactory sensory neurons—which are found mainly in the flies' antennae—responded most strongly whenever an odor changed rapidly in strength , and showed relatively little response to constant odors . An independent study by Schulze , Gomez-Marin et al . found that olfactory sensory neurons in fruit fly larvae also respond in a similar way . Kim et al . also found that the response of the projection neurons depended on both the rate of nerve impulses in the olfactory sensory neurons and on how quickly this rate was changing . But , unlike the olfactory sensory neurons , projection neurons showed their strongest responses immediately after an odor first appeared . Thus , in contrast to organisms such as bacteria and worms , which are highly sensitive to the local concentration gradients of odors , fruit flies instead appear to be more responsive to the sudden appearance of an odor in their environment . Kim et al . suggest that this difference may reflect the fact that for ground-based organisms , local gradients are generally reliable predictors of the location of an odor source . However , for flying insects , continually changing air currents mean that predictable local gradients are less common . Therefore , the ability to detect a hint of an odor before the wind changes is a more useful skill .","Temporal experience of odor gradients is important in spatial orientation of animals . The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster exhibits robust odor-guided behaviors in an odor gradient field . In order to investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli , we subjected flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) and projection neurons ( PNs ) . We found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns , manifested by the PN output strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change . A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output . When cascaded with the rate-of-change encoding by OSNs , PNs primarily signal the acceleration and the rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers , thereby enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations . 
 Odor distribution in nature is intermittent and dynamic ( Murlis et al . , 1992; Vickers et al . , 2001 ) , and animals have evolved the ability to detect and respond to temporal variation of odor stimuli ( David et al . , 1983; Thesen et al . , 1993; Vickers et al . , 2001; Porter et al . , 2007; Semmelhack and Wang , 2009; Kato et al . , 2014 ) . In one of the most sophisticated examples , Drosophila larvae with only a single functional olfactory sensory neuron ( OSN ) are capable of moving toward a droplet of an attractive odor by actively orienting themselves ( Louis et al . , 2008 ) . Similarly , adult fruit flies exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors such as turning upwind in flight upon contact with an attractive odor plume ( Budick and Dickinson , 2006 ) and staying within a specific odor zone ( Semmelhack and Wang , 2009 ) . In order to enable such odor-guided tasks , it is essential for any olfactory system to process time-varying features of olfactory stimuli and supply behaviorally relevant information to higher brain centers . Several recent studies have investigated how dynamic olfactory stimuli are processed in insect early olfactory systems ( systems consisting principally of OSNs and projection neurons [PNs] ) and observed significant temporal processing of odor signals ( Bhandawat et al . , 2007; Geffen et al . , 2009; Kim et al . , 2011; Nagel and Wilson , 2011; Martelli et al . , 2013 ) . Most of these studies employed a simple odor delivery system that generated step-pulse-like odor stimuli without directly monitoring the actual odor concentration levels . For a rigorous understanding of sensory processing , however , it is essential to precisely measure the input stimuli and systematically explore the input space , as has been successfully done in the field of vision and audition ( Wu et al . , 2006 ) . Moreover , natural odor plumes are encountered in various spatiotemporal patterns , and their dynamics and statistics can influence the neural encoding mechanism ( Brenner et al . , 2000; Vickers et al . , 2001 ) . In Drosophila , OSNs expressing the same receptors connect with PNs in one of roughly 50 spherical compartments , termed olfactory glomeruli , which constitute a deutocerebral neuropil called the antennal lobe . PNs subsequently relay olfactory information to higher brain centers such as the mushroom body and the lateral horn ( Stocker et al . , 1990 ) . Two recent studies independently reported that Drosophila OSNs encode not only the odor concentration but also its rate of change as a function of time ( Kim et al . , 2011; Nagel and Wilson , 2011 ) . Building on this recent advance , we asked how PNs further contribute to creating internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments . We tested OSNs and PNs with short plume-like odor stimuli in a variety of settings and analyzed the correlation structure of input/output signals in the odor-OSN-PN pathway . We also constructed a two-dimensional ( 2D ) linear–nonlinear ( LN ) model of the OSN-to-PN transformation by inducing an ensemble of triangle-shaped OSN spike rates via a systematic design of olfactory stimuli . 
 We employed a novel odor delivery system that can reliably produce various odor concentration waveforms and provide measurements of the odor concentration with a millisecond resolution on every experiment trial ( Figure 1A , B ) ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Various odor concentration profiles were designed and tested ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) , and the corresponding OSN and PN responses were measured in two separate assays sharing the same odor delivery system ( Figure 1A , B ) . The observed odor concentrations were closely matched between the two assays ( Figure 2A–C ) . We used acetone as the primary odorant because its low ionization potential afforded a high signal-to-noise ratio in our odor concentration measurements . We tested a pair of directly connected OSNs and PNs innervating the DM4 glomerulus with five different acetone concentration waveforms . The dynamics of OSN and PN responses differed significantly from their respective feedforward inputs , and all responses initiated within a few tens of milliseconds of the odor onset ( Figure 1C ) . PNs generally showed a bigger peak spike rate and exhibited more phasic spiking patterns than the presynaptic OSNs . However , the exact functional transformation between OSNs and PNs could not be readily assessed due to the complex dynamics of OSN and PN signals . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 006 We therefore designed a set of elementary odor concentration waveforms: a step , a ramp and a parabola ( top row of Figure 2A–C ) . We reasoned that the simple nature of these waveforms would facilitate the analysis of the input/output relationship . Consistent with previous reports ( Kim et al . , 2011; Nagel and Wilson , 2011 ) , OSNs responded most strongly to polynomial waveforms when the odor concentration rose rapidly . For the ramp and parabola odor signals , OSN responses were the exact rate-of-change function of their input: a step output to a ramp input ( Figure 2B , E ) and a ramp output to a parabola input ( Figure 2C , F ) . This pattern of encoding was preserved for different combinations of odorants and OSN-PN pairs ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . To look into this observation formally , we measured the similarity between three different input features—concentration amplitude , rate of change , and acceleration—and the output spike rate of OSNs by performing a set of cross-correlation analyses . The correlation was strong between the OSN output and both odor concentration and its rate of change , but weak between the OSN output and the acceleration of odor concentration ( Figure 2J ) . Given the very same panel of olfactory stimuli , PN responses exhibited bigger peak amplitude and more stereotyped temporal patterns than OSNs ( Figure 2G–I ) . All PN responses transiently peaked at the time of the odor onset , and their peak times were on average advanced from the OSN peak times . Specifically , in response to ramp-shaped OSN signals , PNs exhibited a rapid step response ( Figure 2F , I ) . To step-like OSN signals , PN showed a phasic onset response , followed by a tonic spiking pattern ( Figure 2E , H ) . These input/output relationships are reminiscent of the rate-of-change encoding in the odor-to-OSN transformation , where the ramp and step odor signals were similarly transformed . Biophysically , this phenomenon suggests a rapid adaptation between OSNs and PNs , which is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating strong short-term depression in synapses between OSNs and PNs ( Kazama and Wilson , 2008 , 2009; Nagel et al . , 2015 ) . From a modeling perspective , this observation predicted a strong correlation between the PN spike rate and the rate of change of the OSN spike rate . A correlation analysis between the PN output and three different input features—OSN spike rate , rate of change , and acceleration—confirmed this prediction ( Figure 2K ) . Together , this supports the hypothesis that PN responses can be modeled as a function of the OSN spike rate and its rate of change , at least for the tested class of odor stimuli . We therefore propose a simple model of the OSN-to-PN transformation comprising two input blocks: the OSN spike rate and its rate of change , followed by a 2D nonlinearity that maps these inputs into the PN spike rate ( Figure 3D ) . The model has the structure of a classical 2D LN model with its linear blocks postulated as amplitude and rate-of-change filters ( Brenner et al . , 2000; Geffen et al . , 2009 ) . Given the hypothesized input blocks , the model can be fully identified by estimating the nonlinear block from experimental data . The validity of the model can be tested by assessing its ability to predict the PN response to new odor waveforms . In order to estimate the nonlinearity , we first designed OSN spike activity profiles that explore the hypothesized PN input space with an efficient sampling grid . An ensemble of triangle-shaped inputs was shown to be suitable for this purpose , since each up/down ramp stimulus tests the target system with a distinct pair of positive and negative gradients while also sweeping a wide range of input amplitudes ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 007Figure 3 . A simple two-dimensional ( 2D ) model characterizes the OSN-to-PN transformation . ( A ) Input/output traces used in modeling the OSN-to-PN transformation ( n = 5 trials for both OSN and PN data ) . An ensemble of triangle-shaped OSN spike rates ( middle ) were designed as a direct in vivo input to the PNs . These OSN spiking patterns were induced by an ensemble of parabola odor inputs ( top ) . ( B ) Input and output samples for the 2D nonlinearity block . Input axes are OSN spike rate and its rate of change , and the output is the PN spike rate .

( E ) The 2D model was tested for a set of OSN spike rates to evaluate its predictive ability . The black surface depicts a three-dimensional rendering of the 2D nonlinearity in ( B ) . Six OSN spike rates—five triangle-shaped signals and one step-pulse-shaped input—and their rate-of-change functions were projected to the surface . Amplitude readouts from the trajectories on the surface constitute the simulated PN output . The step-pulse-shaped input was introduced for cross-validation of the model since this input was not used for building the model . ( F ) The predicted PN spike rate closely followed the magnitude and dynamics of the experimental PN spike rate , for six OSN spike rate inputs ( insets ) . The average prediction errors are 31 , 26 , 21 , 21 , 23 , 29 spike/s ( clockwise from the top-left corner , in root-mean-square error ) .

( A ) The triangle-shaped OSN spike rate ( top ) , its rate of change ( middle ) , and the corresponding PN spike rates ( bottom ) . At a fixed OSN spike rate ( 60 spike/s , a solid red line in the top panel ) , the PN spike rate varies from 0 to 280 spike/s depending on the rate-of-change value of the OSN spike rate . ( B ) At a fixed OSN spike rate ( blue line for 30 spike/s , red line for 60 spike/s , green line for 120 spike/s , as depicted in ( A ) ) , the PN spike rate is linearly related to the rate-of-change value of the OSN spike rate with half-wave rectification in the negative rate-of-change interval . ( C ) The gain β of the PN response , with respect to the rate of change of the OSN output , decreases with increasing input amplitude . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 008 How can we induce an ensemble of triangle signals at the OSN output ? We fine-tuned odor concentration signals , while observing the OSN spike rate , until the desired OSN spike rates were produced ( Figure 3A ) . The odor concentration signals inferred from this method are an ensemble of parabolas with systematically varying peak times and amplitudes ( Figure 3A ) . The 2D nonlinearity was estimated subsequently by running a ridge regression analysis on spike rate samples from the OSN and PN signals ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 3B , C ) . The estimated 2D nonlinearity showed a strong dependency on the rate-of-change of OSN spike rate ( Figure 3B , C ) . When the nonlinearity was estimated for samples with a fixed odor concentration value , the PN spike rate rose almost linearly with respect to the rate of change ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . However , the gain of the PN output with respect to the OSN rate of change decreased monotonically with concentration , suggesting that at least a 2D model is required to describe the OSN-to-PN transformation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . We tested the model by comparing the simulated model output with the experimental PN spike activity ( Figure 3C ) . With step , ramp , and parabola odor inputs , the experimental outputs were closely matched by the model ( root-mean-square error = 25 spike/s , Figure 3F ) . While the odor-evoked responses were well matched by the model , including peak times and amplitudes , the model output often overestimated the actual PN spike rate before and after the stimulus interval . This is because the estimated nonlinearity exhibits a relatively high slope at low input amplitudes ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) , which renders the system highly sensitive to the noisy fluctuations at low OSN spike rates ( Pahlberg and Sampath , 2011 ) . This problem is thought to be mitigated in olfactory glomeruli by pooling input from a population of OSNs , thereby achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio than provided by a single OSN ( Bhandawat et al . , 2007 ) . In summary , the proposed simple 2D model provides a decent approximation of the OSN-to-PN transformation and corroborates the notion that PNs mainly encode OSN spike rate and its rate of change in a nonlinear fashion . What is the functional consequence of acceleration encoding by antennal lobe PNs ? In signal processing theory , the time derivative , or rate-of-change operation , advances the phase of a time signal . For example , cos ( t ) is the time derivative of sin ( t ) , and its phase is advanced by π/2 . Similarly , the rate of change of a sample triangle-shaped signal shows an advancement of a peak time , and its acceleration exhibits a peak time that is further advanced ( Figure 4A ) . Therefore , we reasoned that the computation of the first and second time derivatives ( rate of change and acceleration ) of odor concentrations by OSN and PNs , respectively , acts to advance peak times of olfactory stimuli . To investigate this idea with a larger set of odor stimuli , we designed a set of triangle-shaped odor waveforms with peak times varying uniformly between 0 . 6 s and 1 . 7 s after the stimulus onset ( Figure 4B , ‘odor’ curve in Figure 4C ) . As shown in the previous experiments with triangle-shaped stimuli ( Figure 2B ) , OSNs responded in a pulse-shaped pattern ( Figure 4B ) , with the peak response advanced by 400–1000 ms relative to the stimulus peak ( ‘OSN’ curve in Figure 4C ) . In response to the same panel of odor stimuli , PNs consistently produced peak output ( Figure 4B ) at around 200 ms after the stimulus onset , regardless of the dynamics of the odor/OSN signals ( ‘PN’ curve in Figure 4C ) . For the parabola-shaped odor stimuli ( Figure 3A ) , the peak OSN and PN responses were similarly advanced in time relative to the odor and OSN peaks ( right plot in Figure 4C ) but were more variable . The advancement of a peak time was previously reported for step-pulse odor stimuli ( Bhandawat et al . , 2007 ) , and our work confirms this result for a larger set of dynamically varying odor stimuli . Together , we hypothesize that acceleration encoding in the Drosophila antennal lobe allows higher olfactory centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06651 . 009Figure 4 . A cascade of rate-of-change encodings leads to a rapid detection of the stimulus onset .

 We tested first- and second-order neurons in the Drosophila olfactory system with a wide range of dynamically varying odor concentrations and constructed a simple 2D LN model for the temporal processing of olfactory information . The shape of the 2D nonlinearity and the relatively low prediction error of the model support the hypothesis that the PN spike rate is most strongly dependent on the rate of change of its feedforward OSN input . When combined with the dynamic sensory encoding by OSNs—encoding of odor concentration and its rate of change—PNs signal the rate of change and , most strongly , the acceleration of odor concentration signals to higher brain centers . One remarkable example of the ‘acceleration encoding’ by PNs is found in the OSN/PN responses to the parabolically rising odor input , where the onset is enormously amplified to create step-like responses in PNs ( Figure 2C , I ) . To the best of our knowledge , the encoding of acceleration by an olfactory sensory system has not been demonstrated elsewhere . This sensory encoding mechanism is distinguished from other chemosensory systems . For example , in bacterial chemotaxis , the rate of change of a stimulus is computed and fed directly into its motor system that controls the flagellar rotation ( Bourret et al . , 1991 ) . The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also exhibits a local-gradient-based chemotaxis behavior , and neurons in its sensorimotor pathway are shown to compute the rate of change of concentration gradients ( Suzuki et al . , 2008 ) . Why do fruit flies compute acceleration of odor concentrations ? How is the acceleration of an olfactory stimulus relevant to a fly's chemotaxis ? An efficient chemotaxis strategy should depend on the distribution of odor molecules in the behaviorally relevant range , which can be quantified using a Reynolds number ( Weissburg , 2000 ) . Habitats of both nematodes and bacteria have low Reynolds numbers ( Re < 1 ) , and thus the odor distribution is primarily determined by a diffusion process . In this environment , the steepest local odor gradient can be directly linked to the location of the odor source , and therefore animals in such environments are expected to encode the rate of change of odor concentrations in order to detect the steepest gradient . In contrast , flying insects experience fluid mechanics that have relatively high Reynolds numbers ( Re > 10 ) , with turbulence dictating the distribution of odor molecules over the diffusion process . In this regime , the local odor gradient within an odor plume would be less informative in determining the location of the odor source than the distribution of odor plumes over a macroscopic scale . In fact , it has been well established that insects , including fruit flies , use a strategy of turning upwind during odor plume encounters , a strategy that does not require interpreting local concentration gradients ( Budick and Dickinson , 2006 ) . Furthermore , the relative position of a flying animal and the distribution of odor plumes evolve rapidly over time . It is therefore crucial for flying insects to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before the fly's position drifts relative to adjacent plumes . We showed that Drosophila's early olfactory system signals the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers . This encoding mechanism allows an animal to detect the odor onset at a very early phase ( Figure 4 ) . Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that the acceleration encoding has evolved in Drosophila to maximize its chance to locate the odor source in a turbulent environment . It has also been shown that fruit flies can respond to the spatial difference of the odor concentration between two antennae in both walking and flight ( Duistermars et al . , 2009; Gaudry et al . , 2013 ) . However , even with the lack of spatial sampling ability , fruit fly larvae can locate an odor source , based on the temporal sampling of odor gradients ( Louis et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , adult fruit flies may rely on both spatial and temporal sampling methods to locate an odor source , although their relative importance may vary depending on the locomotive state , as Reynolds numbers are different between walking and flight . 
 We built a precise and versatile odor delivery system ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . An odorant was diluted in dipropylene glycol , and 20 ml of the resulting mixture was put into a glass vial ( 30 ml ) and subsequently sealed by a screw cap with a silicone septa . Inlet and outlet needles were inserted into the vial headspace . The saturated vapor in this headspace was puffed by directing a low-flow air stream ( ≤100 ml/min ) from an air cylinder ( UN1002; TechAir , White Plains , NY ) into the odor vial by opening inlet and outlet solenoid valves ( Series 10; Parker-Hannifin Corporation , Cleveland , OH ) . Subsequently , the outlet needle carried the saturated vapor from inside the vial to a custom laminar mixer where the odor flow was combined with a strong carrier flow ( 800 ml/min ) . The mixer was carefully designed so as to minimize the turbulence that could be formed when the low-flow odor stream is added to a high-flow-rate carrier stream . The output of the mixer was then directed to the antennae and maxillary palps of a prepared animal through a glass capillary ( 1 mm inner diameter ) . The interval between two consecutive puffs was between 45 s and 70 s depending on the amount of vapor consumed in each puff , and the mixture was replenished about every 10 trials . All flows were electronically controlled by a miniature pressure controller ( VSO-EP; Parker-Hannifin , OH ) and measured using a digital flow meter ( PV9000; Key Instruments , Trevose , PA ) in real time . After hitting the animal , the odor flow was immediately sucked into a probe and measured by a photoionization detector ( PID; Aurora Scientific , Canada ) with 1 l/min flow rate . The output of the PID was digitally sampled at 10 kHz and later advanced by 2 ms in order to compensate for the latency caused by the suction probe . In order to convert the PID output voltage into the odor concentration in parts per million ( ppm ) , we regularly ( every 10 trials ) measured the output of the PID with a calibration odor ( 3% propylene ) and estimated the general sensitivity of the PID , which gradually decays over time . The PID sensitivity ratio of actual odor to standard odor was measured in a separate experiment with a fully saturated odor vapor and used to calculate a scaling factor between the PID output ( in Volts ) and the absolute odor concentration ( in ppm ) ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Drosophila stocks were maintained at room temperature on a 12-hr light/12-hr dark schedule and kept in standard plastic vials containing a cornmeal agar medium . All experiments were carried out with female flies of the NP3062-GAL4/NP3062-GAL4;UAS-mCD8::GFP/UAS-mCD8::GFP;+/+ genotype . NP3062-GAL flies were kindly provided by Kei Ito . Female flies 2–5 days posteclosion were used for both OSN and PN recordings . For the OSN recordings , single basiconic sensilla were targeted with electrolytically sharpened tungsten electrodes to measure the aggregate electrical activity of OSNs housed in these sensilla ( Figure 1B ) ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . Recordings were analyzed by a custom MATLAB code ( Source code 1 ) to sort out action potentials from Or59b or Or7a OSNs ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) . For the PN recordings , a female fly was gently immobilized beneath a cellulose acetate film with an adhesive ( Datta et al . , 2008 ) . The film was then carefully transferred to a petri dish in which a circular hole was made at the center . When placing an animal in the hole , the location of the head was carefully adjusted so that the antennae and maxillary pals were located strictly within the odor stream between the odor delivery tubing and the suction probe , both of which were embedded in the petri dish . Antennal lobes were exposed by gently removing a head cuticle as well as the film under saline solution containing 108 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl2 , 8 . 2 mM MgCl2 , 4 mM NaHCO3 , 1 mM NaH2PO4 , 5 mM trehalose , 10 mM sucrose , and 5 mM HEPES ( pH , 7 . 5; 265 mOsm ) ( Wang et al . , 2003 ) . In order to access the PN somas , the perineural sheath was weakened by a 1–2 min treatment with 1 mg/ml collagenase ( Type I Collagenase; Sigma–Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . The dorsal part of the sheath was then gently ruptured by a sharp quartz glass electrode using a micromanipulator ( MP-285; Sutter Instrument , Novato , CA ) . A ground electrode was placed into the saline solution and connected to a headstage amplifier ( CV-7B; Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . In order to record action potentials of a single PN , a borosilicate patch electrode ( 7–10 MΩ tip resistance ) filled with saline solution was attached to the target cell and gentle suction was applied through the electrode capillary until a loose seal ( 50–100 MΩ ) was formed . The current was amplified ( MultiClamp 700B; Molecular Devices , CA ) , low-pass filtered at 1 . 2 kHz , sampled at 10 kHz ( Digidata 1322A; Axon Instruments ) , and stored on a computer by software ( Clampex; Molecular Devices , CA ) . The animal was alive and active for a few hours as indicated by the spontaneous extension of its legs . Fresh oxygenated saline solution was perfused throughout the experiment . Finally , the PNs innervating the DM4 and DL5 glomeruli were identified by genetic means , using an enhancer trap line expressing Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP ) in these cells . The identity of recorded cells was further verified by their odor response and the location of the soma in the dorsal cluster of the antennal lobe . Spike sequences were detected and sorted offline using custom software ( Source code 1 ) , written in MATLAB ( MathWorks , Natick , MA ) . Spike rates of OSNs and PNs were estimated by constructing a peristimulus–time histogram ( PSTH ) with a 100-ms bin size and a 75-ms overlap between adjacent bins . For the correlation analysis and 2D model prediction , the rate of change and acceleration components of odor and OSN traces were estimated by a forward difference equation , with the difference time interval as the scaling factor; for example , dxdt=[x ( t−Δ ) −x ( t ) ]/Δ , where x represents either the odor concentration or the OSN response , and Δ denotes the time interval . The time interval was 50 ms for the odor rate of change , 100 ms for odor acceleration , the OSN rate of change and OSN acceleration . Since the output of the forward difference equation is sensitive to high-frequency components of the signal , we low-pass filtered the amplitude and rate-of-change signals before deriving the rate of change and acceleration , respectively . Cut-off frequencies of the low-pass filters were 20 Hz for the odor amplitude , 10 Hz for the odor rate of change , 4 Hz for the OSN spike rate , and 4 Hz for the OSN rate of change . The cross-correlation coefficient , ϱ ( x , y ) between an input x and the corresponding output y was computed as a normalized cross-covariance function; that is , ϱ ( x , y ) =1N∑i=1N ( x[i]−μx ) ( y[i]−μy ) σxσy , where μ and σ are , respectively , the mean and standard deviation of the variable in the subscript . We hypothesized a nonlinear function f ( . , . ) that takes inputs from the OSN spike rate y and its rate of change dy/dt and whose output corresponds to the PN spike rate z; for example , z=f ( y , dydt ) , and f ( . , . ) was estimated using a 2D ridge regression method on 100 × 100 grids ( Kim et al . , 2011 ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['short report', 'neuroscience']",elife-06651-v2,212,5908,5696,27.867924528301888
34,"This text describes novel discoveries about tumor biology, focusing primarily  upon infectious agents. Overall，the manuscript presents compelling insights regarding contage spreading mechanism employedby malignant tumors arisingfrom Australian marsupplies called Tasmanian Devils(Sarcomorhynchus) highlighting potential therapeutic vulnerabilities associatedwith distinct molecular profiles exhibited amongst various cancerous lesions sampled throughout Australia。The paper explores key aspects related tomindividual immunity suppression caused predominantlyvia impaired Major Histocompatible Complex Class Iappressure presented here suggestthat althoughDFTM exhibits contrasting clinical behavior patternsacross geographically distant locations ; however comparable cellular features characterizeits aggressive nature enabling effective targeting strategies potentially applicable towards controlling disease progression achievedthrough experimental therapies involving immunotherapy approach","While cancer cells typically cannot spread between individuals , there are a few examples of contagious tumours . Remarkably , two examples have emerged in a single species , the Tasmanian devil , a marsupial carnivore . These tumours are known as Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( or DFT1 ) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( or DFT2 ) ; both cause tumours round the faces of infected devils . Since it emerged in the 1990s , DFT1 has killed 60–90% of the devil population . Preserving the few remaining healthy devils has been a major challenge for conservationists . This challenge became more urgent in 2014 , when the second contagious cancer , DFT2 , was discovered circulating in the population . Contagious cancers are rare because the immune system usually eliminates cells coming from outside the body . Each healthy cell carries molecules known as the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) that act as a barcode showing where each cell comes from . The immune system uses these molecules to help it tell the difference between the body’s own cells and those from elsewhere . DFT1 can avoid the immune system and spread to new hosts because it has lost MHC . In 2014 , scientists identified a new Tasmanian devil cancer named DFT2 , but it was unclear how this second cancer evades the immune system as it spreads from host to host . Caldwell et al . have now examined the MHC on cells from DFT2 cancers , including cells grown in the laboratory and cells taken from cancer biopsies . Biochemical tests showed that the DFT2 cells do carry MHCs , but that the MHC barcodes of DFT2 are similar to those of the devils infected with the disease . This finding may explain how the cancer can spread undetected in these animals , because the immune system does not recognize it as coming from outside the body . Further analyses also reveal that the cancer cells are slowly evolving to lose their MHCs . This means DFT2 could , with time , become as contagious as DFT1 . These two contagious cancers threaten the future of the Tasmanian devil . As top predators , devils are key to the ecosystem in Tasmania and their preservation is vital . While DFT2 provides a unique opportunity to study an emerging cancer as it develops , this research will also help to protect the devils and may lead to effective vaccines . These results could also reveal how other cancers avoid the immune system and may help to detect them during treatment . In addition , there are many similarities between contagious cancer cells and organ transplants . Understanding the role of MHC in DFT2 could lead to better ways to prevent rejection following transplants .","Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( DFT2 ) is a recently discovered contagious cancer circulating in the Tasmanian devil ( Sarcophilus harrisii ) , a species which already harbours a more widespread contagious cancer , Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( DFT1 ) . Here we show that in contrast to DFT1 , DFT2 cells express major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules , demonstrating that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer . However , the most highly expressed MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic , reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing these alleles . In parallel , MHC class I loss is emerging in vivo , thus DFT2 may be mimicking the evolutionary trajectory of DFT1 . Based on these results we propose that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumour and host , but that loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate widespread transmission of DFT2 . 
 Contagious cancers have emerged and circulate in two species of mammals ( dogs and Tasmanian devils ) and four species of molluscs ( Metzger et al . , 2015 , 2016; Novinski , 1876; Pearse and Swift , 2006 ) . The Tasmanian devil is the only mammalian species in which two independent contagious cancers exist , Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( DFT1 ) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( DFT2 ) ( Pye et al . , 2016b ) . Although both cancers have similar gross morphology , causing tumours on the face , neck and oral cavity , genetic analysis shows that they emerged in different individuals ( Pearse and Swift , 2006; Pye et al . , 2016b; Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) . DFT1 was first identified in 1996 in the northeast of Tasmania ( Hawkins et al . , 2006 ) , but has since spread widely , causing close to 100% mortality and drastic decline of affected populations ( Hamede et al . , 2015 ) . In contrast , DFT2 is a more recent contagious cancer , it was first characterised in 2014 and has been formally identified in eleven devils from the Channel region of Southwest Tasmania ( Pye et al . , 2016b; Kwon et al . , 2018 ) . Recent immunohistochemical and drug sensitivity analyses of DFT2 indicate it arose from a similar tissue to DFT1 ( Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) . As allografts , DFT1 and DFT2 cells should be rejected by the host devil through T cell recognition of non-self MHC class I molecules encoded by the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) ( Sherman and Chattopadhyay , 1993 ) . The mature MHC class I molecule is a trimer that acts as a ligand for the T cell receptor ( TCR ) and is composed of a light chain , β2-microglobulin ( β2m ) , in non-covalent association with a heavy chain , which provides a binding cleft for self and non-self peptides . Classical MHC class I molecules are important transplantation antigens that are highly polymorphic , ubiquitously expressed and involved in peptide-antigen presentation . In contrast , non-classical MHC class I molecules have little polymorphism and more diverse functions , including regulation of the immune response particularly by inhibiting natural killer ( NK ) cell function ( Braud et al . , 1999 ) . Allografts can be rejected within 7–14 days when host CD8+ T cells are exposed to non-self MHC class I molecules and their bound peptides on the surface of donor cells ( Rosenberg , 1993 ) . Vertebrates have multiple MHC class I genes that are generally not orthologous between species due to rapid evolution ( Adams and Parham , 2001 ) . Five MHC class I genes have been identified in the genomic region encoding the Tasmanian devil MHC ( Cheng et al . , 2012 ) . Saha-UA , -UB and –UC , are likely classical , with moderate levels of polymorphism and ubiquitous expression , while Saha-UD , –UK and -UM , are non-classical , with limited polymorphism and restricted expression ( Cheng et al . , 2012; Cheng and Belov , 2014 ) . We have previously demonstrated that DFT1 cells down-regulate MHC class I and class II molecules from their cell surface , thereby removing the targets for a T cell response ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) . This is the first indication that DFT1 cells have similar immune evasion mechanisms to those found in single organism tumours ( Hicklin et al . , 1999; McGranahan et al . , 2017 ) . Loss of MHC class I is due to epigenetic down-regulation of β2m , and the peptide transporter encoded by TAP1 and TAP2 ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) but MHC class I can be restored in DFT1 cells when treated with IFNγ ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) . MHC class I positive DFT1 cells have since been used with some success in initiating immune responses to DFT1 cells ( Tovar et al . , 2017 ) . Down-regulation of MHC is also observed in the canine transmissible venereal tumour ( CTVT ) , where MHC molecules are down-regulated during transmission and growth ( Hsiao et al . , 2002; Pérez et al . , 1998 ) . However , subsequent cytokine signalling leads to lymphocyte infiltration of tumours , MHC up-regulation and either tumour regression or stasis of growth ( Yang et al . , 1987 ) . These findings have suggested that loss of MHC class I expression is necessary for the emergence and subsequent transmission of contagious cancers . Why DFT2 cells can pass between individuals without a protective immune response from the host is not known , nor are the conditions that have facilitated the emergence of two contagious cancers in this species . Here we show that in contrast to DFT1 , DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules . However , the dominantly expressed MHC class I alleles are either non-classical or shared with host devils and common in the wider population . Finally , DFT2 tumours were identified with evidence of MHC class I loss , indicating the emergence of MHC class I down-regulation in this tumour . 
 Flow cytometry using a monoclonal antibody against Tasmanian devil β2m was used to assess the level of MHC class I expression on the surface of a representative DFT1 cell line ( DFT1_4906 ) ( Figure 1A ) , DFT1 cells treated with IFNγ ( DFT1_4906 + IFNγ ) ( Figure 1B ) , three DFT2 cell lines ( DFT2_RV , DFT2_SN and DFT2_TD549 ) ( Figure 1C , D and E ) and devil fibroblast cells ( Fibroblasts_Salem ) ( Figure 1F ) . As has been previously reported ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) , DFT1 cells do not express β2m , but DFT1 cells treated with IFNγ upregulate β2m to the same level as devil fibroblast cells . In contrast , all three DFT2 cell lines express cell surface β2m , but the level of expression varies , DFT2_TD549 cells have the highest level of expression ( Mean Fluorescence Intensity ( MFI ) 42 . 1 ) followed by DFT2_RV ( MFI 37 . 6 ) and DFT2_SN ( MFI 12 . 1 ) . Although all three DFT2 cell lines express β2m , they have lower levels of β2m than DFT1 cells that have been treated with IFNγ ( MFI 92 . 5 ) and devil fibroblasts ( MFI 93 . 3 ) . These results indicate that DFT2 cells grown in culture express surface MHC class I molecules in contrast to DFT1 , which is MHC class I negative . RT-qPCR was used to quantify the relative level of MHC class I gene expression for β2m , classical MHC class I and non-classical MHC class I genes in vitro ( Figure 2A–D ) . Due to high nucleotide similarity between the classical MHC class I genes in the Tasmanian devil , Saha-UA , -UB and –UC , and their respective alleles , a single primer set was used to amplify transcripts from these genes as a group . Gene specific primers were used to amplify the non-classical MHC class I genes , Saha-UK ( Figure 2C ) and Saha-UD , which was found only at trace levels ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . RT-qPCR shows that DFT2 cells express significantly higher levels of β2m ( Figure 2A ) , classical MHC class I heavy chain genes ( Saha-UA , -UB and -UC ) ( Figure 2B ) and non-classical MHC class I ( Saha-UK ) ( Figure 2C ) than DFT1_4906 . However , expression of β2m and Saha-UA , -UB and -UC by DFT2 cells is lower than that of DFT1_4906 + IFNγ and Fibroblasts , which is consistent with the levels of β2m expression observed on the DFT2 cell lines . Interestingly , while the levels of Saha-UA , -UB and -UC in the three DFT2 cell lines is lower than DFT1_4906 + IFNγ ( Figure 2B and D ) , the levels of Saha-UK are not significantly different ( Figure 2C and D ) . This is despite the fact that the expression level of the classical MHC class I genes reflects the amplification of three different MHC class I loci compared to a single locus , Saha-UK . Thus , DFT2 cells in vitro express both classical and non-classical MHC class I heavy chain genes . To extend this analysis to primary DFT2 tumours we used RT-PCR to amplify β2m and MHC class I heavy chain transcripts from the DFT2 cell lines and six primary DFT2 tumours collected between March 2014 and January 2016 ( Figure 2E and Supplementary file 1 ) . The primary tumours include DFT2_RVT1 and DFT2_SNT2 from which the cell lines DFT2_RV and DFT2_SN were derived . RT-PCR shows evidence of expression for β2m in the cell lines and in primary tumour samples ( Figure 2E ) , reflecting the expression of cell surface β2m protein in the cell lines . Saha-UK is expressed in all cell lines and primary biopsies . The cell lines and primary tumours express classical MHC class I , but the expression levels appear to be variable between the primary tumours . While this analysis is not quantitative , as the amount of stroma in each sample varies between tumours , these results show that DFT2 cells express both classical and non-classical MHC class I transcripts alongside β2m . To further investigate the expression of MHC class I molecules between DFT2 tumours in vivo , a shared peptide immunogen was used to raise a pan-classical MHC I antibody against the classical MHC class I heavy chains ( Saha-UA , -UB and -UC ) . A second peptide , specific in sequence to Saha-UK , was used to raise an antibody against the non-classical MHC class I , Saha-UK . Monoclonal antibodies were initially screened by western blot using protein from devil fibroblast cells . Positive clones were re-screened for molecule specificity against recombinant Saha-UK and recombinant Saha-UC protein ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Clones specific for Saha-UK ( clone - α-UK_15-29-1 ) and Saha-UA –UB and -UC ( clone - α-UA/UB/UC_15-25-18 ) were identified . Staining of DFT2 serial sections from six primary DFT2 tumours ( Supplementary file 1 ) with these antibodies demonstrates expression of both classical ( Saha-UA , -UB and –UC ) and non-classical ( Saha-UK ) MHC class I molecules in vivo ( Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . However , this analysis also demonstrates that MHC class I expression is variable in DFT2 tumours . Three of the tumours , DFT2_RVT1 , DFT2_SNT2 and DFT2_818T1 ( Figure 3 ) , retain strong expression of classical class I molecules , with localisation to the cell membrane . This result is consistent with the cell surface expression of β2m observed on the DFT2_RV and DFT2_SN cell lines , derived from two of these primary tumours ( Figure 1C and D ) . However , expression of classical MHC class I in DFT2_547 and DFT2_523 is weaker , appears mostly cytoplasmic and shows some variation in staining intensity , with some cells in DFT2_547 showing very low levels of expression . Strikingly , DFT2_812 is negative for classical MHC class I ( Figure 3 ) . The expression of Saha-UK also varies between and within DFT2 biopsies ( Figure 3 ) . DFT2_RVT1 cells are uniformly positive for Saha-UK , whereas DFT2_SNT2 and DFT2_547 have variable expression , with some areas staining more weakly . Interestingly , there is some evidence for Saha-UK staining in DFT2_812 , a tumour negative for classical MHC class I , but DFT2_523 is largely Saha-UK negative ( Figure 3 ) . While the DFT2 tumours with strong classical class I expression show localisation to the cell membrane ( i . e . cell surface expression ) , staining for Saha-UK shows a cytoplasmic distribution in some of the DFT2 tumours . Notably , DFT2 tumours also show morphological heterogeneity ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . DFT2 tumour cells are sometimes arranged as nests separated by a fibroblastic stroma , for example DFT2_547T1 , but can also be arranged in diffuse sheets separated by a fibrous component , for example DFT2_818T1 and DFT2_523T1 . The degree of individual tumour cell nuclear pleomorphism can also vary within the same tumour ( DFT2_SNT2 ) . The expression of MHC molecules by DFT2 cells may mean that this tumour is more immunogenic than DFT1 . As infiltration of lymphocytes has been correlated with a positive prognostic outcome for some cancers ( Galon et al . , 2006; Chee et al . , 2017 ) we stained DFT2 tumours for the lymphocyte marker , CD3 . Staining of the primary tumours shows that lymphocyte infiltration does occur in some individuals ( Figure 4 ) . No CD3 positive cells were observed in DFT2_RV or DFT2_547 ( Figure 4 ) , but a more significant number of CD3 positive cells is evident in DFT2_818 , DFT2_523 and DFT2_812 ( Figure 4 ) , where the lymphocytes are clustered at the stroma and some cells can be seen infiltrating the tumour mass . A small number of CD3 positive cells are visible in DFT2_SN ( Figure 4 ) . The classical MHC class I alleles expressed by DFT2 cells should play a role in any host immune response against the tumour . To assess the MHC class I alleles expressed by DFT2 cells we amplified , cloned and sequenced exon 2 ( the region of the devil MHC class I where the majority of variation is located ) of MHC class I transcripts from DFT2 cell lines . Previous analysis of DFT2 DNA has identified four MHC class I sequences from Saha-UA , Saha-UB and Saha-UC and one sequence from Saha-UD present in the DFT2 genome ( Pye et al . , 2016b ) . We find that DFT2 cells express all five genomic MHC class I sequences , SahaI*35 ( Saha-UA ) , SahaI*90 ( Saha-UB ) SahaI*74/88 ( unassigned ) , SahaI*27 ( Saha-UC ) and SahaI*32 ( Saha-UD ) loci ( Table 1 and Figure 5 ) . We also identified a sixth expressed sequence ( SahaI*27–1 ) that differs from SahaI*27 by one non-synonymous substitution . Alignment of MHC class I sequences from DFT2 and DFT1 cells ( when treated with IFNγ ) show that across exon 2 of the heavy chain DFT1 and DFT2 share expression of four MHC class I alleles , SahaI*27 , SahaI*90 , SahaI*35 and SahaI*27–1 , with only SahaI*46 unique to DFT1 and SahaI*74/88 unique to DFT2 ( Table 1 ) . Using gene specific primers we were able to confirm that both DFT2 and DFT1 cells also express Saha-UK ( non-polymorphic ) ( Table 1 and Figure 2 ) . To assess the relative expression level of each of the classical MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells , PCR amplicons were cloned and >60 clones were sequenced , resulting in 61 classical MHC class I sequences from DFT2 . Of these sequences the most abundant is SahaI*27 , representing 22 ( 36% ) of the clones sequenced ( Table 1 ) . SahaI*27–1 and SahaI*35 were represented by 13 clones each ( 21% ) , while SahaI*74/88 and SahaI*90 were the least abundant , with 9 ( 15% ) and 4 ( 6% ) clones respectively . These results indicate that DFT2 cells do not express MHC class I alleles equally and that the dominant allele is SahaI*27 . Given the dominant expression of SahaI*27 by DFT2 cells we determined the prevalence of SahaI*27 and other MHC class I alleles in three host devils . Exon 2 of MHC class I transcripts were amplified from the mRNA of spleen samples from three devils infected with DFT2 ( TD_RV , TD_818 and TD_SN ) ( Table 1 ) . Alignment of the sequences demonstrates that the host devils share SahaI*32 ( Saha-UD ) , Saha-UK and SahaI*27 with DFT2 . In addition , TD_818 and TD_SN share SahaI*27–1 and either SahaI*35 or SahaI*90 with DFT2 ( Table 1 and Figure 5 ) . The MHC class I alleles that are expressed by DFT2 cells but not by the hosts are of particular interest as they are likely to be immunogenic upon cell transmission . SahaI*74/88 is unique to the DFT2 cell lines and differs from SahaI*27 and SahaI*27–1 found in the host animals by a single non-synonymous substitution at position 59 or position 76 , which are not predicted to interact with the TCR ( Figure 5B ) . The class I alleles with lower expression on DFT2 , SahaI*90 and SahaI*35 , share between 91 and 97% amino acid identity with the host alleles . To identify any further polymorphic sites that may have been missed when selecting clones for sequencing and to validate the sequences found in the hosts we used two approaches . First , we amplified and directly sequenced the MHC class I products from TD_RV , TD_818 and TD_SN to compare the chromatograms produced from sequencing pooled transcripts . This analysis did not reveal any additional polymorphic sites ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Second , we used the sequences identified in Table 1 to conduct targeted searches of the genomes of TD_RV , TD_818 and TD_SN ( Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) to confirm the presence of these alleles in genomic DNA . 
 Here we show that DFT2 cells express classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules both in vitro and in vivo . This is in stark contrast to DFT1 , a likely older and more widespread contagious cancer in the Tasmanian devil , which has lost expression of MHC class I ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) . However , DFT2 cells express the non-polymorphic , non-classical MHC class I molecule ( Saha-UK ) likely reducing the immunogenicity of these tumour cells . Further , the classical MHC class I allele with the highest expression in DFT2 cells is shared with host devils . Finally , we show that MHC class I expression varies among DFT2 tumours in vivo , suggesting that MHC class I negative subclones could emerge as DFT2 transmits more widely . Our results demonstrate that DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules , in contrast to DFT1 and the contagious cancer circulating among dogs , CTVT . DFT1 cells lack surface expression of MHC class I due to loss of β2m , TAP1 and TAP2 transcripts ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) . However , loss of MHC class I in DFT1 is reversible upon treatment with the inflammatory cytokine IFNγ ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) and a small number of individuals have been found to have a successful immune response against the tumour ( Pye et al . , 2016a ) . Similarly , CTVT is thought to down-regulate MHC expression during transmission , but expression can be upregulated on CTVT cells during a tumour specific immune response from the host ( Yang et al . , 1987 ) . In contrast , we show that DFT2 cells express cell surface β2m molecules in addition to classical and non-classical class I heavy chains , indicating that functional MHC class I are present on the surface of DFT2 cells . The expression of a non-classical MHC class I molecule , Saha-UK , on DFT2 cells could reduce the immunogenicity of the tumour cells . Saha-UK is expressed in some DFT2 tumours in vivo and the Saha-UK heavy chain is expressed at similar levels to the three classical MHC class I genes ( amplified as a group ) in vitro . While antibodies specific for Saha-UD are not available , RT-PCR indicates it is also expressed , but at a very low level compared to Saha-UK . Non-classical MHC class I molecules can be inhibitory ligands for NK receptors and some human cancers down-regulate classical MHC class I and overexpress non-classical MHC class I to avoid a cytotoxic immune response ( Kochan et al . , 2013 ) . While the function of Saha-UK and Saha-UD are not known ( Siddle et al . , 2009 ) , neither are highly polymorphic ( Saha-UK is monomorphic [Siddle et al . , 2010] ) and unlikely to elicit an allogeneic T cell response in host devils . However , further investigation is needed to determine the function of these molecules and the functional classification of Tasmanian devil MHC class I molecules as ‘classical’ or ‘non-classical’ . DFT2 cells also express classical MHC class I alleles belonging to the Saha-UA , -UB and -UC loci . Of these classical MHC class I alleles , SahaI*27 is the most abundant in DFT2 cells and is also found in the three host devils , reducing the immunogenicity of DFT2 cells in these animals . The primers designed in this study should amplify all known DFT1 and DFT2 MHC class I alleles with equal efficiency , suggesting that this allele represents an MHC class I locus with dominant expression . As well as being found in the host devils , this allele is highly prevalent in at least one devil population ( Lane et al . , 2012 ) and the high expression levels in DFT2 may be facilitating tolerance of the tumour in this population of devils . The similarity of the MHC class I alleles between DFT2 and host devils may reflect a shared geographical range and genotype pool to the cancer founder's ( Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) . Thus , the frequency of this allele among the wider population may impact the ability of DFT2 to spread further . The heterogenic expression of MHC class I molecules in DFT2 biopsies suggests that MHC class I expression is not fixed and may be gradually lost in DFT2 . While some MHC class I alleles are shared between DFT2 and its hosts , the tumour does have a number of unique alleles . SahaI*74/88 differs to SahaI*27 by only one amino acid that is not predicted to interact with the TCR , but SahaI*90 and SahaI*35 have a number of unique sites when compared to host MHC class I alleles . While these alleles have lower expression on DFT2 than SahaI*27 , their presence may still initiate an immune response in some host animals , providing a selective pressure for MHC class I loss . It is possible that , like single organism tumours , DFT2 is undergoing immunoediting ( Dunn et al . , 2002 ) , which can operate to down-regulate specific MHC class I alleles that are immunogenic ( McGranahan et al . , 2017 ) or select for mutations that remove or modulate total MHC class I expression . However , while four of the six primary DFT2 tumours examined have CD3 positive cells in the tumour mass , which may indicate an immune response , the infiltration is notably present in DFT2_812 , which is negative for classical MHC class I and could be expected to be CD3 negative . Thus , further detailed analysis is needed to define the host immune response to DFT2 and its role in shaping tumour evolution . While DFT1 cells currently circulating in the population are MHC class I negative , it is possible that DFT1 down regulated MHC class I expression after the tumour became transmissible and that initial transmission events were among individuals that shared prevalent MHC class I alleles . This is supported by previous studies that have found reduced polymorphism in devil MHC and microsatellite loci ( Jones et al . , 2007; Siddle et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , a hemizygous deletion of β2m has recently been identified in a DFT1 cell line , perhaps indicating past selective pressure for MHC class I loss in this older transmissible tumour ( Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) . Similarly , CTVT is thought to have emerged in an old world dog and the genetic structure of a dog pack would have favoured the emergence of CTVT ( Murgia et al . , 2006 ) . However , the presence or absence of MHC antigens is likely not singly responsible for determining the ability of the host to respond to the tumour . DFT2 may also be manipulating its microenvironment by release of immune suppressive cytokines , such as Transforming Growth Factorβ , which can drive metastasis ( Tauriello et al . , 2018 ) and in conjunction with PD1/PD-L1 interactions can inhibit and exclude T cells from a tumour ( Mariathasan et al . , 2018 ) . In addition , recruitment of T regulatory cells ( Curiel et al . , 2004; James et al . , 2010 ) or immunosuppressive myeloid cells ( Almand et al . , 2001 ) can also negatively impact the T cell responses to tumours . DFT1 is now at least 21 years old and CTVT is predicted to be over 10 , 000 years old ( Murchison et al . , 2014 ) , whereas DFT2 was first discovered in 2014 and is most likely a recently emerged tumour ( Pye et al . , 2016b ) . As such , DFT2 provides an opportunity to study the early evolution of a contagious cancer . The emergence of a contagious cancer that can transmit while maintaining MHC class I expression indicates that loss of MHC is not necessary for transmission , but as the tumour encounters the immune system of genetically disparate hosts subclones that have down-regulated MHC may be selected . Our results predict that loss of MHC class I is already occurring , perhaps due to structural mutations or epigenetic changes . Loss of MHC antigens could allow rapid dissemination of DFT2 through the population , impacting an already vulnerable species . 
 Six wild Tasmanian devils were either trapped or found dead from road trauma or other causes . Tissue biopsies and fine needle aspirates were either collected post mortem or from live devils that were subsequently released . All animal procedures were performed under a Standard Operating Procedure approved by the General Manager , Natural and Cultural Heritage Division , Tasmanian Government Department of Primary Industries , Parks , Water and the Environment or under University of Tasmania Animal Ethics Committee Permit A0014976 . Sample information is shown in Supplementary file 1 . Tumour and spleen samples were collected as described in Supplementary file 1 and were formalin fixed ( 10% neutral buffered formalin ) and then paraffin embedded . The DFT1 cell line , DFT1_4906 , and fibroblast cell line , Fibroblasts_Salem , have been described elsewhere ( Murchison et al . , 2012 ) . Three cell lines derived from DFT2 primary tumours ( DFT2_RV , DFT2_SN and DFT2_TD549 ) were established from fine needle aspirates collected in culture medium and cultured at 35°C and 5% CO2 . Cell lines DFT1_4906 , DFT2_RV and DFT2_SN were grown in RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) with 10% heat inactivated foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( 100 units/ml penicillin and 0 . 1 mg/ml streptomycin ) ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Fibroblasts_Salem was cultured in DMEM with high glucose and L-glutamine ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) with 10% FBS ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) and penicillin/streptomycin ( 100 units/ml penicillin and 0 . 1 mg/ml streptomycin ) ( Gibco; ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Cells were passaged at 80–90% confluency at a ratio of 1:3 using trypsin ( 0 . 05% ) to detach cells . DFT1 cells were treated with recombinant devil IFNγ derived from a transfected cell line ( CHO_SahaIFNy ) as previously described ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) . Cells were incubated on ice with anti-devil β2m antibody supernatant for 30 min , followed by secondary antibody ( 2 μg/ml goat anti-Mouse IgG ( H + L ) Alexa Fluor 488 Conjugate; ThermoFisher Scientific ) for 30 min . The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by incubating 50 μg/ml recombinant devil β2m protein ( Siddle et al . , 2013 ) with anti-devil β2m antibody on ice for 30 min prior to staining . Cells were analysed on BD FACSCalibur and data analysed using FlowJo software . MHC class I transcripts were aligned and translated into protein sequences using CLC workbench . Two regions were identified , in the α1 domain and the α3 domain , where the amino acid sequenced of the Saha-UA , -UB and –UC sequences are highly similar to each other , with only one amino acid change , but contain low similarity to Saha-UK and Saha-UD . Using these sequences the following peptides were synthesised for immunisations , WMEKVQDVDPGYWE against Saha-UA , -UB and -UC and RITHRTHPDGKVTL against Saha-UK . Mice were immunised subcutaneously with a mixture of GERBU adjuvant and 50 μg of either WMEKVQDVDPGYWE-C or RITHRTHPDGKVTL-C coupled to diphtheria toxoid via the N-terminal cysteine . Three days later spleen lymphocytes were fused with the SP2 cell line using PEG as fuseogen . Hybridomas were selected based on reactivity in ELISA against both N- and C-terminal coupled peptide and subsequently screened against Tasmanian devil fibroblast cells and verified against recombinant expressed MHC class I by western blot as described below . Cell pellets were lysed on ice for 30 min at 4 × 107 cells/ml lysis buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 100 mM TrisCl , 1 mM MgCL2 and 1% digitonin ) and the lysates clarified . 10 μl of cell lysate was added to 15 μl loading buffer ( 500 μl 2X Lamelli sample buffer , 50 μl β-mercaptoethanol and 450 μl dd-H2O ) and heated to 95°C 10 min . Samples were run on 12% ProtoGel ( National Diagnostics Protogel 30% ) using Laemmli buffers and Fisherbrand Vertical Gel Tank . Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose blotting membrane ( Amersham Protran GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) in transfer buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 190 mM glycine and 20% ( w/v ) methanol ) using Mini Trans-Blot Cell ( Bio-Rad ) . The membrane was blocked for 45 min with 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% Tween 20 , 4% milk powder , 50 mM TrisCL , pH 8 and incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight , washed with 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% Tween 20 , 4% milk powder , 50 mM TrisCL , pH 8 , and incubated with secondary antibody ( IRDye 680RD Goat anti-Mouse IgG ( H + L ) ) for 30 min at room temperature before washing as above . Membranes were visualised using the Li-cor Odyssey scanner . The specificity of the antibodies was determined using full length recombinant devil MHC class I heavy chain proteins for Saha-UC ( SahaI*27 ) and Saha-UK . SahaI*27 and Saha-UK were amplified from devil fibroblast cDNA using primer Saha349 and Saha350 ( Saha-UC ) and Saha335 and Saha351 ( Saha-UK ) ( Supplementary file 2 ) . The subsequent amplicons were cloned into the pET22b+ vector ( Novagen ) and transformed into Rosetta pLysS cells ( Novagen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the transcripts were sequenced in both directions . Bacterial colonies containing pET22B+-SahaUC and pET22B+-SahaUK were cultured to OD600 0 . 6 and protein expression was induced with 1 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) . Bacterial cells were pelleted and resuspended in solubilisation buffer ( 8 M Urea , 50 mM Mes pH 6 . 5 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT ) and the lysates clarified . The total protein in lysates was measured using Bradford Reagent following the manufacturers instructions . 20 μg protein was loaded onto a 12% gel and electrophoresis and blotting were performed as described above . Membranes were incubated with the undiluted supernatant from primary antibodies α-UK_15-29-1 and α-UA/UB/UC_15-25-18 at 4°C overnight . DFT1 and DFT2 primary tumours were fixed in 10% ( mass/vol ) PBS-buffered formalin solution for 2 to 4 d . Tissues were processed and embedded in paraffin blocks and cut onto coated slides at 4–5 μm thickness . Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded alcohol . Antigen retrieval was performed by water bath ( 95°C ) in citrate buffer solution ( 10 mM citric acid , 0 . 05% Tween20 pH 6 ) for 40 min followed by cooling for 15 min . Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation of slides with 0 . 3% H2O2 ( Sigma Aldrich ) and non-specific protein binding was blocked with 10% ( mass/vol ) goat serum . Sections were incubated with primary antibody ( list of antibodies in Supplementary file 3 ) at 4°C overnight . Peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody ( Envision kit; Dako ) was used to detect primary antibody binding following the manufacturers instructions . Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin ( vector hematoxylin nuclear counterstain Gill’s Formula ) for 4 min , differentiated in 2% ( mass/vol ) acetic acid and blued in 0 . 2% ( mass/vol ) ammoniated water . Sections were dehydrated through graded alcohol to xylene and cover-slipped . Images were captured using the Nikon Eclipse 400 microscope , Retiga 2000R camera and Q-capture pro seven computer software . The Nucleospin RNA II kit ( Macherey-Nagel ) was used to extract RNA from cell lines according to the manufacturer’s instructions . 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using Thermofischer Scientific RevertAid Premium Reverse Transcriptase ( 200 U ) with 1X RT buffer , 0 . 5 mM dNTPs , 20 pm oligodT primer ( Promega ) and nuclease free H2O to a total volume of 20 μl . Primer set one was designed to amplify the classical MHC class I ( Saha-UA , -UB and –UC ) by aligning all available MHC class I sequences from the Tasmanian devil and embedding primers in conserved regions . Primer set one amplifies the three loci as a group , due to the high level of sequence similarity between the classical class I genes , gene specific PCRs for these loci were not possible . Primer set two was designed to amplify the non-classical MHC class I ( Saha-UK ) . All primers are listed in Supplementary file 2 . RT-qPCR was carried out for RPL13A , β2m , classical MHC class I ( Saha-UA , -UB and -UC ) and non-classical MHC class I ( Saha-UK ) on the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) using PrecisionPLUS qPCR MasterMix ( Primerdesign ) with primers at 5 mM each following the cycling protocol; 95°C 2 min , followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min . RPL13A was used as the reference gene and data analysis was performed using the relative standard curve method for comparing gene expression ( DFT1_4906 = 1 ) . All cDNA samples were tested in triplicate and controls with no cDNA template were included . DFT2 at four dilutions ( 250 , 50 , 10 , 2 and 0 . 4 ng ) was used to create a standard curve of amplification for RPL13A with an R2 of 0 . 999 and 97 . 14% efficiency . Recombinant DNA at five dilutions ( 0 . 2 , 0 . 04 , 0 . 008 , 0 . 00016 and 0 . 000032 ) was used to create a standard curve of amplification of MHC class I Saha-UK and MHC class I Saha-UA , UB and UC with R2 values of 0 . 991 and 0 . 997% and 105 . 2 and 111 . 4% efficiency respectively . IFNγ treated DFT1 ( 4906 ) cells at five dilutions ( 250 , 50 , 10 , 2 and 0 . 4 ng ) was used to create a standard curve of amplification for β2m with an R2 of 0 . 994 and 91 . 4% efficiency . The Nucleospin RNA II kit ( Macherey-Nagel ) was used to extract RNA from DFT2 cell lines , DFT1 cells after treatment with IFNγ , and host samples ( TD_RV , TD_SN and TD_818 ) . The NucleoSpin totalRNA FFPE kit ( Macherey-Nagel ) was used to extract RNA from formalin fixed tumour tissues according to the manufacturer’s instructions . 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA as described previously . Three primer sets were used to amplify all classical and non-classical MHC class I alleles . Primer set one was used to amplify Saha-UA , -UB and –UC products as a group , primer sets 2 and 3 were used to amplify Saha-UK and Saha-UD genes specifically ( for PCR conditions see Supplementary file 4 ) . All products were purified using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up ( Macherey-Nagel ) , cloned into a pJET plasmid ( CloneJET; ThermoFisher Scientific ) . Plasmid DNA from individual clones was isolated and sequenced using T7 primer . PCR , cloning and sequencing was performed in triplicate for the DFT2 cells and duplicate for the spleen samples . For primer set 1 between 15 and 65 clones were sequenced for each PCR , for primer sets 2 and 3 between 4 and 6 clones were sequenced . To assess the relative abundance of each of the classical MHC class I alleles within DFT2 cells 65 clones were isolated and sequenced using primer set 1 . To validate the MHC class I alleles , Saha-UA , -UB and -UC genes were amplified using primer set one as described above and resulting PCR products ( containing all MHC class I alleles for these genes ) were sequenced directly using these primers . The resulting chromatograms were used to identify polymorphic sites in the transcripts and to confirm the validity of alleles . In addition , MHC class I alleles for RV , 818 and SN were searched against genomes generated for these animals ( Stammnitz et al . , 2018 ) to validate their presence in the genome . All sequences were quality checked and analysed in CLC Genomic Workbench . Residues in the MHC class I sequences predicted to interact with the peptide or the TCR were identified by aligning to HLA-A2 ( Bjorkman et al . , 1987 ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials\xa0and\xa0methods']","['immunology and inflammation', 'cancer biology']",elife-35314-v1,99,6636,6537,67.03030303030303

While sensory areas receive and analyse input from the senses , motor areas plan and trigger muscle contractions . Precisely adjusting the connections between these and other areas enables us to learn new skills , and it also helps us to relearn skills lost as a result of brain injury or stroke . About 70 years ago , a psychologist named Donald Hebb came up with an idea for how this process might occur . He proposed that whenever two neurons are active at the same time , the connection between them becomes stronger . This idea , that ‘cells that fire together , wire together’ , became known as Hebb’s rule . Many studies have since shown that Hebb’s rule can explain changes in the strength of connections between pairs of neurons . But can it also explain how connections between entire brain regions become stronger or weaker ? New results show that it can . The data were obtained using a technique called optogenetics , in which viruses are used to introduce genes for light-sensitive proteins into neurons . Shining light onto the brain will then activate any cells within that area that contain the resulting proteins . Yazdan-Shahmorad , Silversmith et al . used this technique to activate small regions of either sensory or motor brain tissue in live macaque monkeys . Doing so strengthened the overall connectivity between the two areas . The effects were more variable at the level of smaller brain regions , with some connections becoming weaker rather than stronger . However , Yazdan-Shahmorad , Silversmith et al . show that Hebb’s rule explains most of the observed changes . Many neurological and psychiatric disorders stem from abnormal brain connectivity . Simple forms of brain stimulation are already used to treat certain neurological disorders , such as Parkinson’s disease . Stimulating the brain to induce specific changes in connectivity may ultimately enable us to leverage the brain’s natural learning mechanisms to cure , instead of just treat , these conditions .","Brain stimulation modulates the excitability of neural circuits and drives neuroplasticity . While the local effects of stimulation have been an active area of investigation , the effects on large-scale networks remain largely unexplored . We studied stimulation-induced changes in network dynamics in two macaques . A large-scale optogenetic interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of excitatory neurons and electrocorticographic recording across primary somatosensory ( S1 ) and motor ( M1 ) cortex ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016 ) . We tracked two measures of network connectivity , the network response to focal stimulation and the baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes; these were strongly correlated before stimulation . Within minutes , stimulation in S1 or M1 significantly strengthened the gross functional connectivity between these areas . At a finer scale , stimulation led to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network . These changes reflected the correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity , consistent with Hebbian plasticity models . This work extends Hebbian plasticity models to large-scale circuits , with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation . 
 Many neurological and psychiatric disorders arise from dysfunctional neural dynamics at the network level , which in turn stem from aberrant neural connectivity ( Stam , 2014; Wu et al . , 2016; Edwardson et al . , 2013; Yahata et al . , 2016; DeSalvo et al . , 2014; Skudlarski et al . , 2010 ) . The brain shows marked plasticity across a variety of learning and memory tasks ( Takeuchi et al . , 2014; Bliss et al . , 2014 ) and during recovery after brain injury or stroke ( Edwardson et al . , 2013; Hara , 2015; Murphy and Corbett , 2009 ) , and many have proposed to take advantage of this innate plasticity to treat neural disorders ( Miller et al . , 2010; Jackson et al . , 2006; Lucas and Fetz , 2013; Edwardson et al . , 2013 ) . In principle , brain stimulation protocols can be designed to leverage this plasticity in order to rewire aberrant neural connectivity , potentially curing these disorders . Implementing such treatments requires a better understanding of how stimulation-induced plasticity drives changes in network connectivity and network dynamics . The simple Hebbian model of plasticity ( Donald , 1949 ) and spike-timing dependent versions of it ( Bi and Poo , 2001 ) explain a large body of data on activity-dependent plasticity , including both in vitro ( Massobrio et al . , 2015; Abrahamsson et al . , 2016 ) , and in vivo ( Andersen et al . , 2017; Feldman , 2012; Shulz and Jacob , 2010 ) studies . Despite the extensive work studying Hebbian plasticity at the cellular level , it remains unclear how synaptic plasticity leads to large-scale functional reorganization . Recently , several studies have shown large-scale plasticity following brain stimulation that is consistent with Hebbian mechanisms ( Jackson et al . , 2006; Lucas and Fetz , 2013; Seeman et al . , 2017; Nishimura et al . , 2013; Rebesco and Miller , 2011; Rebesco et al . , 2010; Song et al . , 2013; Lajoie et al . , 2017 ) . In particular , Fetz and colleagues implemented an activity-dependent stimulation protocol , effectively introducing an artificial connection between two sites in the motor cortex ( Jackson et al . , 2006; Lucas and Fetz , 2013 ) . Continuous reinforcement of this artificial connection led to a stable functional change in stimulation-evoked movements , indicating that stimulation induces large-scale plasticity . Recently these results were reproduced in a modeling work at the network level ( Lajoie et al . , 2017 ) . Similar results have been observed using open-loop stimulation protocols to induce targeted plasticity between two cortical sites ( Rebesco and Miller , 2011; Seeman et al . , 2017 ) . Notably , these papers have reported off-target effects , but these were either interpreted as global changes in excitability or were not explained . Although the results from closed-loop and open-loop experiments suggest large-scale plasticity , the underlying neural network changes remain unexplored . Here , we measure connectivity across sensorimotor cortex and track changes in network connectivity in response to open-loop stimulation . This work takes advantage of a large-scale optogenetic interface ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016 ) that enables us to simultaneously stimulate populations of excitatory neurons while recording large-scale μ-electrocorticography ( μ-ECoG ) activity across two brain areas , S1 and M1 . We first establish and compare two measures of functional connectivity that provide complementary views of the mechanisms of plasticity . Next , we investigate how stimulation impacts connectivity between and within cortical areas . We then test whether stimulation-evoked activity drives large-scale network plasticity in a Hebbian manner . The goal of this work is to investigate large-scale functional reorganization following stimulation , which will inform future neurorehabilitation strategies . 
 We quantified inter-area functional connectivity between S1 and M1 using two different measures—one based on the network response to optogenetic stimulation and the other based on spontaneous neural activity . The first measure focused on how the response to optical stimulation propagates through the network . Optogenetic stimulation in S1 and M1 evoked responses across both cortical areas , and we characterized these responses according to their amplitudes and delays ( Figure 2A and E ) . The delays exhibited a bimodal distribution with a 3–6 ms separation between the early and late responses ( Figure 2B and F ) . Classifying the responses across electrodes by delay recovers the spatial separation between the two cortical areas—following a boundary along the central sulcus—with shorter delays in the area being stimulated ( S1 or M1; primary responses ) and longer delays in the other area ( M1 or S1; secondary responses ) ( Figure 2C and G ) . The short delay of the secondary responses suggests close functional connectivity between these areas . We quantified this connectivity with the stimulus-evoked response ratio ( SERR ) . SERR was defined as the peak-to-trough amplitude of the secondary responses ( A2 ) normalized by the peak-to-trough amplitude of the primary response ( A1 ) , with both responses measured in the high gamma ( 60–200 Hz ) filtered signal ( see dashed-line inset boxes in Figure 2 , A and E ) . The SERR is a measure of the connectivity between the site of stimulation and sites in the other cortical area ( see Figure 2D and H ) . The second measure evaluates functional connectivity during spontaneous activity . We focused on the coherence in field potential recordings between electrodes , a widely used measure of connectivity that captures the degree of phase-locking between two signals ( Lang et al . , 2012; Bastos and Schoffelen , 2015 ) . We calculated the coherence between the site of stimulation and the secondary sites across different frequency bands . Because SERR and coherence are derived independently from recordings with and without simultaneous stimulation , they might reflect fundamentally different aspects of network connectivity . Therefore , in each experiment we compared these two measures prior to conditioning stimulation . Figure 3A shows two examples comparing SERR to coherence in the theta band ( 4–8 Hz ) . To quantify the relationship between these measures , we performed linear regression between them across channels ( Figure 3B–C ) . An example showing a strong relationship between SERR and theta band coherence is shown in Figure 3B . This analysis was repeated for all coherence frequency bands and for all experiments; the mean and standard error of the regression parameters are shown in Figure 3C . The two measures of functional connectivity were highly correlated: across sessions , the distribution of regression slopes was significantly different from 0 ( t-test: p=3 . 73e-06 ) , and 69 percent of individual experiments showed significant linear regressions ( p<0 . 05 ) . This finding indicates that at baseline , before any conditioning , the stimulation-evoked response reflects network dynamics across the frequency spectrum . We used a simple stimulation protocol—we delivered 5 ms laser light pulses at a frequency of 5 or 7 Hz at either one or two cortical sites ( Figure 4A ) . For our initial analyses , and unless otherwise noted , when stimulating at two cortical sites , we alternated stimulation between the two light sources to avoid any interference between the evoked responses from each light source . In each experiment , conditioning stimulation was applied for 50 min , and we evaluated functional connectivity every 10 min during blocks of passive baseline recording and active testing ( 100 light pulses delivered through each laser ) . We also conducted control sessions with the same passive recording and testing blocks , but with no stimulation during the conditioning blocks . A representative example experiment , shown in Figure 4B , shows that stimulation in M1 leads to significant increases ( paired t-test , p=3 . 88e−11 ) in mean SERR . Similar increases in SERR were observed for a majority of experiments ( 14 out of 18 experiments ) across both monkeys ( Figure 4C ) . The increases in connectivity were symmetric between the two cortical areas ( Figure 4D ) . No significant change in mean SERR was observed in control sessions without conditioning stimulation ( Figure 4D ) . Furthermore , the increase in SERR was significantly larger for stimulation sessions than control sessions ( unpaired t-test: p=0 . 0036 ) We next asked whether conditioning increased coherence-based measures of inter-area connectivity . We did observe increases in mean theta band ( 4–8 Hz ) coherence following conditioning , as shown in Figure 4E for the same dataset used in Figure 4B ( paired t-test , p=0 . 03 ) . The increase in theta coherence was significant for the majority of experiments ( 13 out of 20; Figure 4E ) , and the effect was localized to the theta band ( Figure 4G; paired t-test , p=0 . 017; Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons ) . We also looked for change in the theta-band power as a result of stimulation and did not see any significant changes , supporting the conclusion that changes in coherence reflect changes in functional connectivity ( See Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . We showed in Figure 3C above that SERR and coherence are correlated measures of functional connectivity in the baseline condition . Here we ask how this relationship is changed by stimulation . Figure 4H ( black lines ) replicates the baseline data from Figure 3C , along with new data showing the correlation between these measures at the end of each experiment ( green lines ) and between their conditioning-induced changes ( yellow lines ) . After conditioning , the cross-channel correlation between these measures significantly decreased ( paired t-test , p=6 . 3e-10 ) , and the changes in connectivity were uncorrelated ( t-test on distribution of regression slopes , p=0 . 85 ) . This suggests that the stimulation affects the two measures differently . To further address this , we replicated this analysis for our control ( no stimulation ) sessions . In this case , we did not see a significant decrease in the correlation between measures after control sessions ( paired t-test , p=0 . 36; see Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Additionally , a direct comparison between the median decrease in the correlation for stimulation versus control sessions showed a significant difference when all frequencies were considered ( p=0 . 0025 ) , though the difference was not significant when only compared in the theta band . Together , these results show that the stimulation-induced changes in these two measures of connectivity do not correlate with each other at a fine-scale . This may reflect the fact that the two measures are not functionally equivalent , despite their correlation , i . e . , they capture related , but not identical , aspects of connectivity . As shown in Figure 1B , our stimulation protocol included 5 repetitions of baseline recording , testing , and conditioning . This design allowed us to track connectivity changes across time , after each 10 min increment of conditioning . Additionally , since neural activity was recorded throughout the experiment , we were able to measure changes in SERR during conditioning blocks . Figure 5A shows the evolution of mean inter-area connectivity for both measures in an example session . To account for differences in network connectivity across monkeys and sessions , we also analyzed the changes in each measure with respect to the baseline pre-conditioning measurements ( Figure 5B ) . For this example session ( Figure 5A ) , and on average across all sessions ( Figure 5B ) , there is a trend of increasing connectivity across the session that starts within the first 10 min conditioning block . These increases in inter-area connectivity measured with SERR and coherence ( Figure 5B ) were correlated across time ( Pearson correlation coefficient = 0 . 26 ) . Additionally , the rate of strengthening was consistent across conditioning blocks; we detected a significant increase in SERR ( p<0 . 05 ) at ~ 4 . 5 min of stimulation in 4 out of 5 conditioning blocks ( see Figure 5—figure supplement 1 for comparison with control sessions ) . Note that the stimulation-induced plasticity was not reinforced during baseline recording blocks . Given the length of the conditioning ( 10 min ) and baseline recording ( 5 min in most experiments ) blocks , one might expect that stimulation-induced changes would revert back to baseline . We did observe a significant decrease ( paired t-test , p=2 . 9e-05 ) in the SERR between the last 100 pulses of the conditioning block and the following test block , indicating some unlearning of the stimulation-induced connectivity changes . We next evaluated the fine-scale effects of conditioning across the entire network . Since SERR is restricted to connectivity from the stimulation site , this analysis was conducted using only changes in pairwise coherence . Figure 6A shows data from an example session , with connectivity changes represented as a set of heatmaps: the heatmap at each recording site represents the change in pairwise coherence between that electrode and all of the other electrodes . A magnified example heatmap is shown in Figure 6A , right; top panel . This example shows heterogeneous changes in connectivity across the network . We next asked whether such heterogeneous changes are to be expected . A Hebbian plasticity model suggests that the fine-scale changes in connectivity should reflect the statistics of plasticity-inducing activity . In this case , we predicted that correlated stimulation-evoked activity between two cortical sites would strengthen the functional connectivity between them , while uncorrelated or anti-correlated stimulation-evoked activity would weaken their functional connectivity . We quantified stimulation-induced correlations by measuring the pairwise coherence during the conditioning block and subtracting out the coherence calculated during baseline recording ( thought to be representative of initial connectivity ) . We refer to this difference as the stimulus-evoked coherence . Indeed , in the example session of Figure 6A , one can see a similarity between the pattern of changes in baseline coherence across the array ( left panel ) with the stimulus-evoked coherence ( middle panel ) . To quantify this similarity , we used linear regression to predict changes in baseline coherence across sites based on the stimulus-evoked coherence . Importantly , both of these quantities use the initial baseline coherence as a reference . So to avoid spurious correlations introduced by subtracting the same data from the two regression variables , we split the baseline recording blocks into two intervals and used the data from only one interval for each regressor ( See Materials and Methods for more details ) . Data from the example session in Figure 6A is shown as a scatter plot in Figure 6B , along with the calculated regression parameters . The plot shows a strong correlation between the stimulus-evoked coherence and changes in baseline coherence . This relationship was consistent across our data ( Figure 6C ) : the distribution of linear regression slopes across experimental sessions and monkeys was significant ( paired t-test: p=2 . 41e-19; 101 out of 105 experimental blocks had significant ( p<0 . 05 ) linear regression models ) . These results support a Hebbian model for network-wide changes in connectivity . To further test this model , we conducted some experimental sessions using a more complex spatio-temporal pattern of optical stimulation . Specifically , by reducing the latency between the two light sources to either 10 or 30 ms ( Figure 7A ) , we introduce interference between evoked responses from the two light sources ( Figure 7B ) . We repeated the analysis of mean inter-area coherence changes ( c . f . Figure 4F ) for these sessions , and we did not see a consistent increase in mean inter-area connectivity ( Figure 7C ) . Nevertheless , we found that stimulus-evoked coherence continued to predict changes in baseline coherence ( paired t-test on the distribution of regression slopes: p=1 . 37e-28; linear regression slopes with p<0 . 05: 160 out 170 blocks; Figure 7D , see Figure 7—figure supplement 1 for an example session ) . Furthermore , the regression parameters were similar to those obtained with the simple stimulation patterns ( Figure 6C ) , and both simple and complex stimulation experiments yielded regression slopes that were significantly larger than those obtained from control sessions ( long-latency vs . control sessions , ranksum test: p=0 . 048; short-latency vs . control sessions , ranksum test: p=0 . 037; see Figure 7—figure supplement 2 ) . These results demonstrate a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in baseline connectivity across the network . These findings are well explained by a Hebbian model of large-scale stimulation-induced plasticity . 
 Functional connectivity between M1 and S1 has been demonstrated in fMRI ( Matsui et al . , 2011; McGregor and Gribble , 2015 ) , electrophysiology ( Iriki et al . , 1989; Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016; Prsa et al . , 2017 ) , and anatomical studies ( Kosar et al . , 1985; Petrof et al . , 2015 ) . To evaluate stimulation-induced changes across these areas we investigated two measures of functional connectivity , one based on stimulation and one based on natural neural processing . Variants of SERR ( Seeman et al . , 2017; Feldmeyer and Sakmann , 2000; Klinshov et al . , 2014 ) and coherence ( Bastos and Schoffelen , 2015; Lang et al . , 2012 ) have been used previously to evaluate functional connectivity . However , to our knowledge they have never been used in combination or compared . In principle , these two measures reflect different aspects of functional connectivity . SERR is a more direct measure of the projections from the stimulation site . Importantly , stimulation likely evokes activity from both terminals and cell bodies located at the stimulation site , though C1V1 does not express well down at the axon ( Rajasethupathy et al . , 2015 ) . Secondary responses arise from a combination of synaptic , antridromic , and indirect ( network ) effects . That said , based on the timing of the evoked responses and the limited expression of C1V1 in axon terminals , we expect the amplitude of secondary responses normalized to primary response amplitudes to reflect synaptic connectivity . Coherence , on the other hand , measures the broader effects of network-wide dynamics . Despite these differences , we saw that the measures are robustly correlated across channels at the beginning of our experiments . This would be expected in a network where stability was maintained with a Hebbian mechanism . In other words , direct connectivity , as reflected in SERR , drives correlated activity , which is reflected in coherence; conversely , correlated activity drives changes in connectivity ( see Network effects ) . These coupled mechanisms lead the network to a stable , steady state ( Fox and Stryker , 2017; Toyoizumi et al . , 2014; Zenke and Gerstner , 2017 ) . Notably , however , our conditioning protocol caused the two measures of connectivity to become less correlated across electrodes . This might seem surprising given that conditioning led to a significant mean increase in connectivity between S1 and M1 for both measures and that the changes in coherence were robustly predicted by the stimulus-evoked coherence . However , this decrease in the correlation between the measures after conditioning seems to be limited to high frequencies and may reflect a transient instability of the network due to the stimulation-induced perturbations in connectivity . Previous work has demonstrated that either activity dependent ( Jackson et al . , 2006; Lucas and Fetz , 2013; Nishimura et al . , 2013; Rebesco et al . , 2010; Song et al . , 2013 ) or paired electrical stimulation ( Rebesco and Miller , 2011; Seeman et al . , 2017 ) can lead to plastic changes in both primate and rodent cortex . Here we demonstrated that optogenetic stimulation at even a single location strengthens inter-area functional connectivity between brain areas . A similar observation was reported for one session of single-site electrical stimulation ( Seeman et al . , 2017 ) . This result is consistent with spike-timing dependent plasticity ( STDP ) rules ( Bi and Poo , 2001 ) . In particular , since the time difference between the activation of the primary ( pre-synaptic ) and secondary ( post-synaptic ) responses to optical stimulation is about 3–6 ms , repetitive stimulation should strengthen the connectivity from the site of stimulation to the other area . While stimulation-induced long-term potentiation ( LTP ) and STDP have been observed within local circuits ( Iriki et al . , 1989; Feldman , 2012; Shulz and Jacob , 2010 ) , and have been posited as the mechanism of stimulation-induced plasticity within M1 ( Lajoie et al . , 2017 ) this is the first study explaining large-scale changes across cortical networks . Notably , conditioning drove increases in coherence between S1 and M1 only in the theta band ( 4–8 Hz ) . This result is difficult to interpret because the conditioning stimulation frequency ( 5 or 7 Hz ) itself lies within the range of the theta band . It is possible that Hebbian mechanisms are selectively enhancing connectivity at the conditioning frequency . It’s also possible that theta band coherence best reflects the plastic connections between these areas . Since we did not vary stimulation frequency outside of this range , no strong conclusions can be drawn . The temporal dynamics of both measures reveal a trend of increasing inter-area connectivity throughout the experiment . This trend suggests that neuroplastic changes start almost immediately after the start of stimulation . Interestingly , we observed unlearning of the stimulation-induced changes during passive recording , though some of the stimulation-induced changes persisted . Previous studies have shown that longer conditioning sessions ( 3–48 hr ) result in changes that are stable over timescales comparable to the length of conditioning ( Jackson et al . , 2006; Lucas and Fetz , 2013; Seeman et al . , 2017; Nishimura et al . , 2013; Rebesco and Miller , 2011 ) . Further experiments are required to estimate the stability of plasticity following optogenetic stimulation over longer time scales . Given that Hebbian rules have been used extensively to explain synaptic plasticity , we wanted to explore the idea that large-scale stimulation-induced changes are consistent with Hebbian plasticity . The strongest test of the Hebbian model is to compare the correlations directly induced by stimulation with the changes in network correlations observed after conditioning . Our ability to record artifact-free signals during stimulation allowed us to perform this test . We did find a predictive linear relationship between stimulus-evoked coherence and the changes in baseline coherence after conditioning . Furthermore , the model held for both simple and complex spatiotemporal patterns of stimulation-evoked activity . There is a large body of research on sensory cortical plasticity ( Merzenich et al . , 1983; Qi et al . , 2011 ) . This study differs in two key dimensions . First , previous work has largely focused on how changes in the statistics of sensory input and/or motor output affect the cortical representation in sensory cortex . In contrast , we have directly manipulated cortical circuits , without a detailed knowledge of the somatotopic map . Also , earlier work studied plasticity on the time scale of days to months , while we are studying changes across minutes . Despite these differences , both appear to support a key role for Hebbian learning in sensorimotor cortical plasticity . Still , a deeper understanding of the relationship between these bodies of work would require a study of intermediate time-frames as well , along with detailed cortical mapping . These are important questions for future work . The large-scale interface used in this study enabled robust estimation of functional connectivity and stimulation-evoked correlations . However , there are several limitations in our experimental setup . First , surface stimulation combined with high blue light absorption and scattering in tissue limits the depth of light penetration ( Yizhar et al . , 2011 ) . The ability to target specific cortical layers would help us understand the anatomical basis of the plasticity we observed . Second , surface µECoG recordings reflect a summation of nearby neural activity , making comparisons to explicit synaptic learning rules difficult . Depth recordings would reveal more detailed information about spike timing , the role of different cortical layers , and the relationship between synaptic and large-scale plasticity . Lastly , the µECoG arrays were placed acutely for each experiment . To investigate the long-term effects of stimulation we need stable , chronic recordings . Our results offer a proof-of-concept that optogenetic stimulation can drive predictable changes in network-scale connectivity . The success of optogenetics in NHP represents an important step forward for translational use ( Doroudchi et al . , 2011; Han , 2012 ) . The continued rapid progress in the field has the potential to bring cell-type specific neuromodulation therapies to the clinic . However , even where therapeutic approaches ultimately wind up using electrical stimulation , the advantages of optogenetics make it a powerful tool for better understanding the underlying mechanisms of plasticity and , thus , for the development of therapeutic applications of neuromodulation . This framework also provides scientific insight into the mechanisms of neural plasticity . Future efforts should focus on linking the plasticity results presented here with improvements in motor function or sensory perception , which will have important implications for stimulation-based therapies . 
 Here , we give a brief summary of our large-scale optogenetic interface ( details in ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016 ) . We combined three existing techniques to implement a practical , large-scale interface for both manipulation and recording from the surface of the brain in two rhesus macaque monkeys . We used an efficient technique for infusion of the optogenetics viral vector ( AAV5 . CamKIIa . C1V1 ( E122T/E162T ) . TS . eYFP . WPRE . hGH , 2 . 5 × 1012 virus molecules/ml; Penn Vector Core , University of Pennsylvania , PA , USA , Addgene number: 35499 ) into primary somatosensory ( S1 ) and motor ( M1 ) cortices based on convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) . We infused 200 μL of virus in four sites ( two in M1 and two in S1 ) in monkey G and 250 μL in five sites ( two in M1 and three in S1 ) of monkey J . Infusion rate started at 1 µl/min and was increased to 5 µl/min . Following infusion we used an artificial dura to protect the brain while maintaining optical access . We verified expression with epifluorescent imaging . To record the evoked responses in both M1 and S1 , we used either one or two 96 channel micro-electrocorticography ( μ-ECoG ) arrays that were designed to allow minimally-attenuated ( Ledochowitsch et al . , 2015 ) optical access . In both animals , we observed reliable light evoked neural responses from the large channel-expressing areas . Optical stimulation was applied using a fiber optic ( core/cladding diameter: 62 . 5/125 um , Fiber Systems , TX , USA ) that was connected to a 488 nm laser ( PhoxX 488–60 , Omicron-Laserage , Germany ) and was positioned above the array ( Figure 1 ) . We used a Tucker-Davis Technologies system ( FL , USA ) for µ-ECoG recording and to control the laser stimulus . We chose the locations of stimulation based on the results of our epifluorescent imaging ( see ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016 ) ) and whether we got a physiological response to light stimulation . Based on detailed histological and electrophysiological analyses , ( see ( Yazdan-Shahmorad et al . , 2016 ) ) we estimate that there was a uniform distribution of expression around our infusion sites and at the locations that we chose to stimulate . The monkeys were awake sitting in primate chairs for the duration of experiments . To ensure that the monkey remained awake , we provided random reward as well as audio and visual stimuli ( displaying a cartoon ) . In addition , we visually monitored the animal throughout the experiment . Our stimulation and recording paradigms consisted of baseline recording , testing and conditioning blocks ( Figure 4A ) . During baseline recording blocks we collected 5 min or 30 s of baseline activity . In test blocks we delivered 100 light pulses ( five msec duration at 5 Hz ) to each laser; pulses were alternated between laser sites in blocks of 10 pulses each in order to reduce the effects of habituation . For the conditioning blocks we stimulated through one or two lasers at a frequency of 5 or 7 Hz for 10 min . We repeated this protocol five times for each experiment . Our experiments consisted of single- and two-site stimulation with different laser configurations: i ) one or two lasers in M1 , ii ) one or two lasers in S1 and iii ) one laser in M1 and one laser in S1 . For two-site stimulation , the delay between the two lasers was 10 , 30 , 70 or 100 ms . We also included control sessions in which we kept the structure of passive recording and active testing blocks , but did not stimulate during the conditioning blocks . Monkeys were deeply sedated ( per above Surgical procedures ) and perfused transcardially with heparinized phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) followed by cold 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer . The brain was extracted and post-fixed in the same fixative for 24 hr at 4°C and then dissected into twelve 6 mm-thick coronal blocks using a custom matrix . After 7–10 days incubation in 30% sucrose , blocks were frozen and cut on a cryostat ( Microm , Germany ) into 50 μm thick sections . Representative sections were selected from each block and processed for EYFP immunocytochemistry using a free-floating technique . Sections were initially washed in PBS , incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 10 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity , then rinsed in two changes of 50% ethanol followed by three changes of PBS for 5 min each . Next we incubated the sections in 5% normal donkey serum in PBS for 1 hr to block non-specific binding . Primary rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody ( Abcam , RRID: AB_303395 ) was diluted 1:15 , 000 in PBS containing 0 . 01% Triton X-100 and was applied to the tissue for 48 hr at 4°C . Sections were then rinsed in PBS , incubated in biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit antibody , ( 1:2 , 000 , Jackson Immunoresearch ) for 12 hr at 4°C , rinsed and incubated in ExtrAvidin ( Sigma-Aldrich , 1:5 , 000 ) for 5–6 hr in room temperature . Peroxidase was detected using a diaminobenzidine ( DAB ) chromogenic reagent ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . Sections were rinsed in PBS , mounted on gelatin-coated slides , air dried , dehydrated in graded alcohols , cleared in xylene and coverslipped with D . P . X . mounting media ( Sigma-Aldrich ) . Additional adjacent sections were stained with cresyl violet ( Nissl ) using standard techniques , to reveal cortical cytoarchitecture . Double immunofluorescence was performed using the similar to above approach although using combinations of primary antibodies from different host species for GFP and for the interneuron markers . Primary antibodies were: rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody ( 1:10 , 000 , Abcam , GFP ab290 ) ; goat polyclonal anti-GFP antibody ( 1:1 , 000 , Abcam , ab5450 ) . These were paired with one of the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibody for parvalbumin , ( 1:1 , 000 , Sigma-Aldrich P3088 ) ; mouse monoclonal antibody for calbindin ( 1:800 Sigma-Aldrich CB-955 ) ; rat monoclonal antibody for somatostatin ( 1:200 , Millipore MAP354 ) ; rabbit polyclonal anti-GAD65/67 ( 1:500 , Millipore AB1511 ) ; a cocktail of mouse monoclonal antibody for GAD67 ( 1:500 , Millipore MAB5406 ) and mouse monoclonal antibody for GAD65 ( 1:1 , 000 , Sigma-Aldrich G1166 ) . Sections were blocked using normal donkey serum and processed for 4–6 hr in a mix of matching secondary antibodies; all of which were raised in donkey ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , 1:300 ) : anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 , anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 ( both for GFP ) . Interneuron markers were visualized using anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 594 , anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594; anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 . Sections were mounted using Vectashield ( Vector Labs ) and imaged using Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope ( Zeiss , Germany ) and 90i imaging system equipped with a CCD camera ( Nikon , Japan ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and Methods']",['neuroscience'],elife-31034-v2,234,5769,5535,24.653846153846153

But the genome has many other features outside these regions , some of which play an important biological role . Transposable elements – repetitive sequences that are present in many species – make up around half of the mouse genome . They are ‘selfish’ elements , in that the spread of them within the genome does not necessarily benefit the host organism . But sometimes transposable elements can be ‘domesticated’ , and used to the host’s advantage . For example , transposable elements can generate new genes . In other cases , their non-coding sequences can regulate the activity of other nearby genes or even those elsewhere in the genome . It remains unclear to what extent transposable elements have shaped genome regulation throughout evolution . One idea is that the spread of transposable elements can help to establish large regulatory networks – whereby many genes are collectively regulated to produce a specific output . But it has not been fully explored how effective transposable elements are at regulating gene expression . Now , Todd et al . investigate whether particular transposable elements , that are suspected to boost the activity of other genes , are essential for normal gene expression in early mouse development . Todd et al . genetically edited stem cells from the inner and outer layer of the early mouse embryo to find transposable elements that promote gene expression . Whilst some transposable elements were found to be important for gene regulation , not all of the candidates tested were needed to maintain expression levels . To widen the search , several transposable elements were turned off simultaneously by compacting specific stretches of DNA so that they could no longer be activated . When 34 transposable elements were inactivated at once , it emerged that only three transposable elements had a significant impact on gene expression . These findings suggest that whether or not a given transposable element regulates gene expression cannot be predicted solely from profiling the structure and sequence of the genome . This highlights why it is important to interrogate the effect transposable elements have ona gene's role within a cell . Transposable elements are largely disregarded in genomics due to technical difficulties in analysing these repetitive stretches of DNA . But characteristic variations within a population may in part be driven by differences in these parts of the genome , which may also be implicated in diseases such as cancer . Identifying which transposable elements are important for driving gene expression , and linking their actions to specific traits could aid the discovery of important genetic variants .","Transposable elements ( TEs ) are thought to have helped establish gene regulatory networks . Both the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the early mouse embryo have seemingly co-opted TEs as enhancers , but there is little evidence that they play significant roles in gene regulation . Here we tested a set of long terminal repeat TE families for roles as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells . Epigenomic and transcriptomic data suggested that a large number of TEs helped to establish tissue-specific gene expression programmes . Genetic editing of individual TEs confirmed a subset of these regulatory relationships . However , a wider survey via CRISPR interference of RLTR13D6 elements in embryonic stem cells revealed that only a minority play significant roles in gene regulation . Our results suggest that a subset of TEs are important for gene regulation in early mouse development , and highlight the importance of functional experiments when evaluating gene regulatory roles of TEs . 
 Our knowledge of the tissue-specific regulatory landscape of genomes has vastly increased over the last 10 years , thanks in part to large efforts from consortia such as ENCODE and NIH Roadmap ( ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012; Kundaje et al . , 2015 ) . But whilst such mapping efforts have been instrumental in categorising the non-coding genome into different types of biochemical activity , our understanding of the associated functional roles remains limited . One of the grand challenges of the post-ENCODE era has been to ascribe regulatory function to the biochemically active non-coding portion of genomes . This question is particularly pertinent to transposable elements ( TEs ) ( Elliott et al . , 2014; Doolittle and Brunet , 2017 ) , which often display marks of regulatory activity in a species-specific manner ( Jacques et al . , 2013; Carninci , 2014 ) . On one hand , successful TEs are expected to display such active profiles , which serve the selfish interests of TEs but may act neutrally with respect to host fitness . On the other , TEs can be co-opted ( or exapted ) by the host to serve gene regulatory roles , such as alternative promoters or enhancers ( Chuong et al . , 2017 ) . The distinction between these two scenarios relies on approaches that query the causal links between TEs , gene expression and phenotype . Primarily based on epigenomic data , evidence to date suggests that particular TE families have contributed to the evolution of tissue-specific gene regulatory networks in contexts such as early development ( Kunarso et al . , 2010 ) , placentation ( Chuong et al . , 2013 ) , pregnancy ( Lynch et al . , 2011 ) and innate immunity ( Chuong et al . , 2016 ) , amongst others . Transcription factor ( TF ) binding motifs hosted within the regulatory portion of TEs enable their expression in specific tissues ( Sundaram et al . , 2014; Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) , presumably in a manner that enables vertical inheritance of new TE insertions via the germline . In this respect , mammalian preimplantation development is a seemingly well exploited context for TE expansion , driving genetic conflicts with the host , as well as creating opportunities for TE exaptation ( Rodriguez-Terrones and Torres-Padilla , 2018 ) . In the mouse , TE-derived regulatory activity has been implicated at multiple stages of preimplantation development . Namely , MERVL elements become highly activated upon zygotic genome activation and are thought to play a role in the establishment of the 2-cell stage expression programme ( Macfarlan et al . , 2012 ) . Transition from the 2-cell stage and development progression to the blastocyst stage appear to depend on LINE-1 expression ( Jachowicz et al . , 2017; Percharde et al . , 2018 ) . Finally , work from embryonic and trophoblast stem cells ( ESCs and TSCs , respectively ) , suggests a divergence in TE regulatory activity that is concomitant with the separation of the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages at the blastocyst stage ( Kunarso et al . , 2010; Chuong et al . , 2013 ) . In ESCs , TE families such as RLTR13D6 bind key ESC TFs ( e . g . , OCT4 , NANOG ) , whereas a distinct subset ( e . g . , RLTR13D5 ) bind factors essential for the maintenance of the TSC state ( CDX2 , ELF5 , EOMES ) . These elements are enriched for histone marks that are characteristic of distal enhancers and lie near genes that are expressed in the lineages where they are active ( Kunarso et al . , 2010; Chuong et al . , 2013 ) . TE enhancer activity depends on the cooperative action of multiple TFs , whose binding motifs appear to have been already present in the corresponding ancestral TE insertions ( Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) . However , it remains unclear to what extent such lineage-specific TEs are important for maintaining gene expression programmes during preimplantation development . Here we have tested the gene regulatory function of specific TE families in ESCs and TSCs using genetic and epigenetic editing approaches , and compared them with predictions from extensive analyses of epigenomic and transcriptomic data . We identify a number of TEs that are important to drive expression of lineage-specific genes . However , our data suggest that these constitute a minority of all the putative TE-derived enhancers identified through bioinformatic analyses , highlighting the importance of functional tests when assessing the contribution of TEs to gene regulatory networks . 
 To identify TEs with putative regulatory potential in embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the blastocyst ( Figure 1A ) , we focused on a set of TE families that were previously shown to be highly enriched for binding of key TFs in ESCs ( RLTR9 , RLTR13D6 ) ( Kunarso et al . , 2010 ) or TSCs ( RLTR13B , RLTR13D5 ) ( Chuong et al . , 2013 ) . These long terminal repeat ( LTR ) families entered the Muridae lineage within the last ~12 . 5 million years ( Thybert et al . , 2018 ) , with copy numbers for each subfamily ranging from 35 ( RLTR9A4 ) to 1302 ( RLTR9E ) , according to the Repeatmasker annotation ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A , B ) . The majority of these elements are found as solo LTRs , as judged by the genomic distance , length and arrangement of consecutive LTRs ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . Nonetheless , we identified some putative proviral elements , mainly associated with RLTR9 subfamilies ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . These include MMERVK9C elements ( bearing RLTR9C LTRs ) and MMERVK9E elements ( RLTR9E LTRs ) . For this study we considered all LTR copies , irrespective of their genomic arrangement . Using uniquely aligned reads from publicly available sequencing data ( Supplementary file 1 ) , we selected TEs bearing the hallmarks of enhancer elements , namely open chromatin status ( from ATAC-seq data ) , binding of at least one of three key TFs ( NANOG , OCT4 or SOX2 in ESCs; ELF5 , EOMES or CDX2 in TSCs ) and enrichment for H3K27ac . To stringently rule out gene promoters we excluded TEs enriched for H3K4me3 and/or lying within 500 bp of known mRNA transcriptional start sites . These putative ‘TE+ enhancers’ also displayed H3K4me1 marking ( Figure 1B ) and were bound by multiple proteins normally associated with enhancer activity , such as p300 and the Mediator and cohesin complexes ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2A ) . This stringent selection led to the identification of 634 TE+ enhancers in ESCs and 358 in TSCs , which represent respectively 9 . 6% and 13% of all the TE copies in the families considered . To estimate how many TE+ enhancers are potentially missed due to reduced read mappability , we simulated sequencing reads that produced ChIP-seq peaks at every TE of interest . After remapping , peak detection failed for 597 RLTR13D6/RLTR9 elements and 915 RLTR13D5/RLTR13B elements , raising the possibility that an additional substantial fraction of TEs from these families could harbour enhancer marks . As expected , RLTR13D6/RLTR9 elements only displayed enhancer-like profiles in ESCs and not in TSCs , whereas the reverse was true for RLTR13D5/RLTR13B elements ( Figure 1C ) . To confirm that TE+ enhancers display a similar lineage asymmetry in vivo and assess the timing of enhancer activation , we analysed two ATAC-seq datasets from pre- and post-implantation embryos ( Wu et al . , 2016; Smith et al . , 2017 ) . We found that 49% and 56% of the identified TE+ enhancers ( in TSCs and ESCs , respectively ) display open chromatin in vivo at some point in early development , with a subset being already active in preimplantation embryos ( Figure 1D ) . Both ESC and TSC TE+ enhancers show some asymmetry with respect to their chromatin status in the respective post-implantation lineages ( epiblast and extraembryonic ectoderm ) , but the tissue specificity is more pronounced for TSC TE+ enhancers ( Figure 1D ) . Following from the above observations and previous findings ( Jacques et al . , 2013 ) , we asked more widely whether TE+ enhancers displayed tissue-specific open chromatin . For comparison , we also generated a list of ‘TE- enhancers’ with the same characteristics as TE+ enhancers ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–D ) but that did not overlap any repetitive elements within the Repeatmasker annotation ( yielding 1988 elements in ESCs and 319 in TSCs ) . Strikingly , whilst a substantial proportion of ESC TE- enhancers displayed open chromatin in multiple tissues , TE+ enhancer activity was far more restricted to ESCs ( Figure 1E ) . Similar results were obtained for TSC enhancers ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) , in line with previous work ( Chuong et al . , 2013 ) . These results suggest that TE+ enhancers are particularly optimised for activity within their respective early embryonic tissues , possibly through the synergistic action of multiple TF binding events ( Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) . Co-option of TE+ enhancers may therefore particularly benefit genes that require highly tissue-specific expression . Despite their sequence similarity , only a relatively small fraction of TEs from any given family bear enhancer-like profiles . It was previously suggested that TE enhancer activity in the ESC and TSC contexts is determined by the presence of key TF binding motifs , which have otherwise been mutated in inactive TEs ( Chuong et al . , 2013; Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) . However , it remains unclear whether such motifs are fully determinant of TE enhancer activity . We therefore performed TF motif analyses of TE+ enhancer sequences . For comparison , we identified TEs from the same families with high read mappability but that did not display enhancer marks , henceforth termed ‘non-enhancer TEs’ ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A ) . TE+ enhancers are on average longer than non-enhancer TEs , as expected if deletions remove key TF binding sites ( Figure 2A , B; Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . Nevertheless , there are many non-enhancer TEs that are full-length LTRs , prompting the question of what are the sequence determinants of enhancer activity . Focusing on long LTR elements ( >60% of maximum length for each family ) , we found enrichment of several motifs at TE+ enhancers ( versus non-enhancer TEs ) . However , no single motif was predictive of enhancer-like profiles ( Figure 2A , B; Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . For example , whilst SOX2 binding motifs were present in nearly all ( 81–91% ) RLTR13D6 and RLTR9E TE+ enhancers , a high proportion ( 48–58% ) of non-enhancer TEs also contained this motif . Notably , motifs for other TFs ( ESRRB , KLF4 ) that have been shown to cooperate with SOX2 for RLTR9E enhancer activity ( Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) were present in similar abundance at both enhancer and non-enhancer TEs ( Figure 2A ) . The co-occurrence of multiple TF motifs in the same element was also insufficient to fully predict enhancer-like profiles . For example , elements containing OCT4 , SOX2 and NANOG motifs accounted for 65% of TE+ enhancers and 21% of non-enhancer TEs in the RLTR13D6 family ( Figure 2B ) , and few RLTR13D5 elements contained all three EOMES , ELF5 and CDX2 motifs ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) . We then asked whether TF binding motifs predicted plasmid-based enhancer activity better than they predict enhancer-like chromatin profiles . Using data from a high-throughput reporter assay in ESCs ( Murtha et al . , 2014 ) , we found that SOX2 , OCT4 and NANOG binding motifs were present in only 12–30% of TEs with plasmid-based enhancer activity ( Figure 2C ) . This suggests that simple sequence features , such as the motifs considered here , are poor predictors of TE enhancer activity , which is in line with recent findings in human ESC enhancers ( Barakat et al . , 2018 ) . Notably , 64% of RLTR13D6/RLTR9 copies with enhancer activity in the reporter assay did not display an enhancer-like chromatin profile . We therefore asked whether TF binding and chromatin opening at non-enhancer TEs was repressed by chromatin features . As we previously described ( de la Rica et al . , 2016 ) , non-enhancer TEs display higher levels of DNA methylation than TE+ enhancers ( Figure 2D ) . However , removal of DNA methylation did not lead to increased enhancer activity at non-enhancer TEs , as judged from ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq data from ESCs lacking DNA methylation ( triple knockout of Dnmt1/3a/3b; Figure 2E ) ( Domcke et al . , 2015 ) . Similar results were obtained with data from hypomethylated naïve ESCs ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1C ) ( Kim et al . , 2018 ) . Additionally , we found no evidence of other chromatin marks that could be maintaining TE enhancer activity repressed ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1D ) . All together , these data show that TE enhancer capacity appears to behave non-deterministically with respect to TF motifs or repressive chromatin marks . Therefore , whilst chromatin profiling and reporter assays are useful probabilistic indicators of potential enhancer activity , the regulatory action of TEs has to ultimately be tested through molecular manipulations in their genomic environment . To establish correlations between TE+ enhancer activity and gene expression , studies to date have largely relied on the linear proximity between TEs and genes . This disregards 3D genome conformation , which enables long-range interactions and is not restricted to one-to-one relationships between TEs and genes . We therefore coupled TE+ enhancers to genes they putatively regulate based on promoter capture Hi-C ( PCHi-C ) data that we recently generated in ESCs and TSCs ( Schoenfelder et al . , 2018 ) . Only 34–44% of TE+ enhancers interacted with at least one gene promoter , which was nonetheless higher than the proportion of non-enhancer TEs with gene promoter interactions ( 21–28% , Figure 3—figure supplement 1A ) . In contrast , a high proportion of TE- enhancers ( 65–70% ) interacted with gene promoters . The contrast between TE+ and TE- enhancers could be explained by the fact that the latter are preferentially positioned within gene-rich , active regions ( known as the ‘A’ spatial compartment ) , whereas TE+ enhancers tend to be located within gene-poor , inactive regions ( ‘B’ compartment; Figure 3—figure supplement 1B ) . Accordingly , TE+ enhancers and TE- enhancers interact with largely non-overlapping groups of genes ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1C ) . To analyse correlations between enhancers and gene expression , we only considered genes that interact exclusively with TE+ or TE- enhancers ( Figure 3A ) . For both ESCs and TSCs , we found that TE+ enhancers interacted with genes that displayed higher expression levels when compared to the genome-wide average or to genes interacting with non-enhancer TEs ( Figure 3B ) . Given the tight tissue specificity of TE+ enhancer profiles that we described above ( Figure 1E; Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) , we asked whether genes interacting with TE+ enhancers displayed lineage-specific expression . We first compared their expression in ESCs and TSCs and found a bias towards the cell type where the interacting TEs display enhancer profiles ( Figure 3C ) . In contrast , the expression of genes interacting with TE- enhancers was on average similar between the two cell lineages . To test for tissue specificity more generally , we analysed gene expression levels across a wide array of tissues using data from the ENCODE project . Strikingly , genes interacting with TE+ enhancers were , on average , almost exclusively expressed in ESCs or TSCs , whereas those interacting with TE- enhancers displayed high expression across a broad range of tissues ( Figure 3D ) . A similar pattern was observed when analysing gene expression at early stages of ESC or TSC differentiation ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . These data are in line with the chromatin accessibility data and suggest that TE+ enhancers may be used to support lineage-specific expression of a subset of genes in early development . However , it is also possible for the correlations observed here to emerge in the absence of causal links between TEs and gene expression . To directly test for a functional role of TE+ enhancers in gene regulation , we performed CRISPR-mediated genetic excision of selected TEs . Based on the bioinformatic analyses above , we chose a set of 4 TEs in ESCs and 2 TEs in TSCs that display strong evidence of enhancer activity ( Figure 4A , B; Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Most genes targeted by these TE+ enhancers , as predicted from PCHi-C data , had skewed expression towards ESCs or TSCs ( Figure 4D ) . We also selected an element interacting with Smarcad1 , a gene involved in pluripotency maintenance ( Hong et al . , 2009 ) , and one element that was previously shown to regulate Akap12 in ESCs ( Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) . After genetically excising TE+ enhancers using pairs of sgRNAs ( Figure 4C ) in multiple clones , we measured the effects on the expression of target genes . In TSCs , both TEs tested were found to be key regulators of their predicted target genes , Map3k8 and Scarf2 , as homozygous null clones displayed ~4-fold reduction in expression ( Figure 4E , F ) . In ESCs , however , only one of the tested TEs had a pronounced effect on the expression of its main target gene ( Figure 4G–J ) . Excision of this particular RLTR13D6 element led to a dramatic ~8-fold reduction in Tdrd12 expression , and also had minor effects on the expression of other nearby genes that interact with it ( Figure 4G ) . Although the associated TE lies within the first intron of Tdrd12 , we found no evidence that it acted as an alternative promoter in ESCs ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) , supporting its role as an enhancer . Heterozygous deletion of the Smarcad1-interacting TE also led to a small but significant decrease in gene expression ( Figure 4H ) . It remains unclear whether failure to isolate homozygous clones was due to a loss of ESC self-renewal caused by Smarcad1 depletion ( Hong et al . , 2009 ) . Excision of the remaining two TEs in ESCs had no effect on the expression of target genes ( Figure 4I , J ) , including Akap12 , suggesting that the previously reported regulatory role of this TE is cell line-dependent ( Sundaram et al . , 2017 ) . In addition to genetic editing experiments , we also analysed data from an ESC line of a hybrid 129 × Cast background , which displays substantial sequence variation between alleles . Using ATAC-seq data from this line ( Giorgetti et al . , 2016 ) , we first identified 98 TEs with biased chromatin accessibility signal across the two genetic backgrounds , suggestive of allele-specific enhancer activity . This included five elements that were polymorphic between 129 and Cast ( according to structural variation data from the Mouse Genomes Project ) , as well as elements present in both species but bearing sequence variation . We then analysed RNA-seq data from the same cell line ( Gendrel et al . , 2014 ) to test for effects on allelic gene expression . However , out of 52 genes within 100 kb of a TE-derived allele-specific enhancer , only four displayed a > 1 . 5 fold difference in expression between alleles ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . Through these genetic approaches we have identified a small set of TEs that play a functional role in the regulation of gene expression in ESCs or TSCs . Yet other TEs play only minor , redundant or no role in gene regulation , despite strong correlative evidence at the level of chromatin composition and conformation . To test in a single experiment the regulatory roles of multiple TE+ enhancers in ESCs we performed CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) targeted at RLTR13D6 elements . We designed two sets of 4 sgRNAs each , with distinct strategies in mind ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) : a ) set 1 maximised the number of RLTR13D6 elements predicted to be targeted by at least one sgRNA ( n = 420 elements with no mismatches , out of 805 ) ; b ) set 2 maximised the number of sgRNAs targeted to each RLTR13D6 element , resulting in a smaller number of copies being targeted ( n = 129 ) . The only substantial predicted off-target effects were with TEs of related RLTR13 subfamilies ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1B ) , which we took into account for downstream analyses . We then established ESC lines stably expressing a dCas9-KRAB fusion protein , followed by lentiviral transduction of either sgRNA set or an empty vector control . After selection of cells expressing both dCas9-KRAB and sgRNAs , we performed H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses 5–8 days post-infection . Although we failed to get adequate signal from a Cas9 ChIP-seq , analysis of published data from a CRISPRi experiment on human LTR5Hs elements ( Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) showed that the number of sgRNAs predicted to bind each element strongly correlates with Cas9 ChIP-seq signal ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) . As 97% of Cas9 binding events at LTR5Hs elements could be predicted in silico , we used sgRNA binding predictions as a surrogate measure for Cas9 binding . Analysis of the H3K27ac ChIP-seq data revealed a reduction in H3K27ac signal at RLTR13D6 elements that were predicted to be targeted by each of the sgRNA sets , whereas H3K27ac levels at RLTR9 elements were unaffected ( Figure 5A , B ) . Notably , elements targeted by multiple sgRNAs displayed a larger reduction in H3K27ac than those targeted by a single sgRNA ( Figure 5A , B ) , in line with recent findings ( Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) . For sgRNA set 1 , CRISPRi resulted in a > 2 fold loss of H3K27ac signal at 30 ( 56% ) RLTR13D6-targeted elements that overlapped a H3K27ac peak . A similar number was obtained for sgRNA set 2 ( n = 25 , 46% ) , with 34 elements being affected in total across the two sets ( out of 76 H3K27ac-marked elements ) . We then asked how these changes affected gene expression . Strikingly , only three genes were significantly differentially expressed upon CRISPRi across both sets of sgRNAs: Tdrd12 , Spp1 and Hook3 ( Figure 5C , D ) . All three cases were associated with a RLTR13D6 element targeted by one or both of the sgRNA sets ( Figure 5E–G ) . Most likely these elements act as distal enhancers given that they lay >6 kb away from the respective transcriptional start sites , whereas heterochromatin spreading as a result of CRISPRi tends to be limited to the open chromatin regions targeted by the sgRNAs ( Thakore et al . , 2015; Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) . Tdrd12 stood out as the most downregulated gene after CRISPRi with either sgRNA set , which together with results from genetic editing experiments above ( Figure 4G ) provide ample evidence that Tdrd12 expression in ESCs critically depends on an intronic RLTR13D6 element . Silencing of this element did not cause any structural alterations of the Tdrd12 transcript , supporting its role as an enhancer ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . The effect of CRISPRi on Hook3 expression was far more subtle , despite a pronounced loss of H3K27ac at the associated RLTR13D6 element ( Figure 5G ) . Notably , Spp1 downregulation occurred in a manner that seemed largely independent of changes in H3K27ac levels ( Figure 5F ) , suggesting that enhancer inactivation occurred through deposition of repressive marks and/or via impairment of TF binding by dCas9-KRAB . For the remainder of the targeted TEs , although as a group the associated genes displayed a significant downregulation upon CRISPRi , these changes were limited to at most 1 . 4-fold ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . This included genes interacting with TE+ enhancers displaying a similar or greater H3K27ac loss to that observed at Tdrd12- or Spp1-associated RLTR13D6 elements . To validate the relatively small effect of some TE+ enhancers on gene expression , we performed additional genetic editing experiments . We chose two RLTR13D6 elements that displayed >2-fold change in H3K27ac levels upon CRISPRi ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3A , D ) , but with little or no effect on neighbouring gene expression ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3B , E ) . Upon CRISPR-mediated deletion of the respective TEs , gene expression levels largely agreed with CRISPRi results , with only the lowly expressed Tsacc gene being downregulated , although the effect was more pronounced in the genetic excision experiment ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3C , F ) . Therefore , whilst CRISPR of individual TEs constitutes a more sensitive approach , our CRISPRi data correlates with genetic excision data and is robust with respect to large effects on gene expression . These results suggest that only a small minority of RLTR13D6 elements play a major role in the regulation of gene expression in ESCs . This is in contrast with the broader correlations found by analysis of epigenomic and transcriptomic data in wildtype cells , highlighting the need to establish causal roles via direct molecular manipulation of TEs . 
 TEs are increasingly being presented as major contributors to gene regulatory networks in a variety of contexts ( Chuong et al . , 2013; Chuong et al . , 2016; Kunarso et al . , 2010; Jacques et al . , 2013; Sundaram et al . , 2014; Lynch et al . , 2011; Fuentes et al . , 2018; Imbeault et al . , 2017 ) . Yet most of these studies have relied largely on the idea that biochemical activity at the chromatin level is indicative of function , a concept famously associated with the findings of the ENCODE project ( ENCODE Project Consortium , 2012 ) that triggered a still ongoing debate ( Graur et al . , 2013; Ponting , 2017; Doolittle and Brunet , 2017 ) . The use of genetic and epigenetic editing tools as presented here , and also used by other labs ( Chuong et al . , 2016; Jachowicz et al . , 2017; Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) , initiate a much needed move to evaluating causal roles for TEs in gene regulation . Our work has revealed that a set of TEs with regulatory potential in ESCs act mostly neutrally with respect to their effects on gene expression , which contrasts with earlier suggestions from analyses of chromatin profiling experiments ( Kunarso et al . , 2010 ) . In the absence of a substantial contribution of ESC TE+ enhancers to gene regulation , the striking correlations emerging from profiling efforts most likely reflect the fact that TE insertions are best tolerated in regions where their tissue-specific enhancer action matches the expression profiles of nearby genes . Whilst the enhancer activity of these TEs could be inconsequential for gene expression , this genomic ‘safe niche’ would be permissive for fixation by genetic drift . Additionally , we cannot exclude the possibility that some TE+ enhancers act redundantly with TE- enhancers , despite our attempt to isolate the effects of each of these enhancer groups . Such TEs could still be important to ensure regulatory robustness and , indeed , enhancer redundancy is a seemingly common feature of enhancer-gene networks ( Osterwalder et al . , 2018 ) . Extensive genetic work will be necessary to evaluate what proportion of TE+ enhancers act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements . In a contrasting example to our findings , epigenetic editing work by the Wysocka lab has revealed that a large proportion of LTR5Hs elements play significant roles in the regulation of nearly 300 genes in a human embryonal carcinoma cell line ( Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) . Notably , in the latter study virtually all H3K27ac-marked LTR5Hs elements were inactivated by CRISPRi ( 257 copies , according to our own analysis ) , probably due to the use of twelve sgRNAs simultaneously ( Fuentes et al . , 2018 ) . It is therefore possible that more efficient targeting of all H3K27ac-marked RLTR13D6 elements ( 76 copies ) in mouse ESCs would uncover additional regulatory elements . However , the effects seen here from silencing 34 ( 44% ) of these copies suggest that regulatory RLTR13D6 elements would likely remain a minority . Another explanation to the differences between LTR5Hs and RLTR13D6 action is that the regulatory effects of TEs are variable between families and cellular contexts . Indeed , other TEs considered here and whose effects we did not test by CRISPRi ( RLTR9 , RLTR13D5 , RLTR13B ) , may play important roles in ESC and TSC gene regulation . These considerations further emphasise the need to perform functional experiments on a case-by-case basis . Despite the neutral action of most TEs analysed here , we have uncovered a number of elements that act as key enhancers of gene expression in ESCs ( Tdrd12 , Smarcad1 , Spp1 and Hook3 ) and TSCs ( Map3k8 and Scarf2 ) . But do these TE insertions impact on cellular and organismal phenotypes , ultimately affecting host fitness ? TDRD12 is a protein essential for secondary piRNA production in mice and is essential for male fertility ( Pandey et al . , 2013; Pandey et al . , 2018 ) . It is therefore possible that the RLTR13D6 element we identified is also active during male germ line development , which would ironically implicate it in genome defence against the mobility of younger , piRNA-targeted TEs . Smarcad1 knockout mice are subviable , displaying growth defects and low fertility ( Schoor et al . , 1999 ) . It remains to be seen whether the activity of the RLTR9E element we identified plays any role in these phenotypes , possibly by affecting early embryonic differentiation ( Hong et al . , 2009 ) . Other genes that we found to be regulated by TEs are not essential for development: both Map3k8 ( Dumitru et al . , 2000 ) or Spp1 ( Rittling et al . , 1998 ) knockout mice are viable and appear to develop normally . In these cases it is likely that the action of the associated TEs is inconsequential to the organism , although there could be more subtle embryonic phenotypes or these TEs could play additional roles outside of the early developmental context . Notably , most exemplars of phenotypically relevant TE-derived regulatory elements have been uncovered by analysing naturally occurring phenotypes ( Lisch , 2013; Chuong et al . , 2017 ) . The reverse approach of searching for phenotypes linked with putative cis-acting TEs has the potential to reveal a wide array of adaptive TE insertions , although this is nonetheless challenging and examples to date are limited ( Chuong et al . , 2017 ) . At a time when epigenomic data are providing abundant indications that TEs play functional regulatory roles , our findings place these observations into perspective and provide a reminder that a large proportion of mammalian genomic sequences are neutrally evolving . Yet evolutionary tinkering ( Jacob , 1977 ) may still benefit from a large amount of ‘junk DNA’ that occasionally can be put to good use . As was fittingly put by Goodier and Kazazian , ‘evolution has been adept of turning some ‘junk’ into treasure’ ( Goodier and Kazazian , 2008 ) . 
 E14 ESCs ( ATCC CRL-1821 ) were grown in feeder-free conditions in DMEM GlutaMAX medium ( Thermo Fisher ) supplemented with 15% FBS , non-essential amino acids , 50 μM 2-mercaproethanol and 1 , 000 U/ml ESGRO LIF ( Millipore ) . TS-Rs26 cells ( a kind gift from Dr . Myriam Hemberger ) were cultured under routine conditions ( Tanaka et al . , 1998 ) : 20% fetal bovine serum , 1 mM Na-pyruvate , Pen/Strep , 50 μM 2-mercaproethanol , 25 ng/ml bFGF and 1 μg/ml heparin in RPMI1640 , with 70% of the medium pre-conditioned on embryonic feeder cells . The identity of the cells was confirmed through RT-qPCR analyses of key ESC and TSC expression markers . Cells were negative for mycoplasma , as tested using the Sigma LookOut PCR kit . Two sgRNA sequences flanking each TE of interest were designed with the use of the Zhang lab online tool ( http://cripsr . mit . edu/ ) and cloned into pSpCas9 ( BB ) −2A-GFP ( Addgene #48138 ) ( Ran et al . , 2013 ) or a modified version of the eSpCas9 ( 1 . 1 ) plasmid system ( Addgene #71814 ) ( Slaymaker et al . , 2016 ) . The pSpCas9/eSpCas9 plasmid constructs were transfected into ESCs and TSCs using FuGENE 6 ( Promega ) with 4 μg equimolar mix of 5’ sgRNA and 3’ sgRNA in 6-well plates . Single GFP-positive cells were sorted into 96-well plates 48 hr post-transfection . After 7–10 days , growing colonies were genotyped using DNA isolated using QuickExtract ( Lucigen ) and the primers listed on Supplementary file 2 . Selected clones were grown further into 6-well plates before collecting RNA using QIAGEN’s DNA/RNA mini kit or QIAzol reagent . For some clones , multiple RNA collections were performed at different passages ( see legend to Figure 4 ) . RNA was DNAse treated with the TURBO DNA-free Kit ( Ambion ) and reverse transcribed with the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit ( Thermo Fisher ) using supplier protocol with 100 ng - 2 μg input RNA . The MESA BLUE SYBR Green mastermix ( Eurogentec ) was used for qPCR analysis ( primers listed on Supplementary file 2 ) . To generate stable ESC line expressing dCas9-KRAB , cells were infected with a lentiviral vector ( a kind gift from Mark Dawson , Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre , Melbourne , Australia ) and mCherry-positive cells were sorted 48–96 hr post-infection . Guide RNA sequences targeting retroelement classes were designed with an R script which downloads all relevant retroelement sequences , identifies potential guide sequences within each sequence and returns guide candidates which match the highest number of targets . Potential off-target effects were verified using the Cas-OFFinder tool ( Bae et al . , 2014 ) and sgRNAs with minimal off-targets were selected . Designed sgRNA sequences were cloned into a lentiviral sgRNA vector ( a kind gift from Mark Dawson ) and packaged into viral particles . The dCas9-KRAB-expressing ESCs were infected and cells sorted at 48 hr to collect dual positive mCherry/BFP positive cells . Cells infected with the empty sgRNA vector were used as a control . RNA was collected by QIAzol extraction at 5 days or 8 days post-infection of the sgRNA lentivirus . Chromatin was collected at 8 days post-infection . Ribosomal RNA-depleted RNA-seq libraries were prepared with the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit ( New England BioLabs ) from 400 to 600 ng of QIAzol extracted total RNA . Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 with single-ended 75 bp reads at the Barts London Genome Centre . Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 12 min , which was then quenched with glycine ( final concentration 0 . 125 M ) . Fixed cells were washed and lysed as previously described ( Latos et al . , 2015 ) . Chromatin was sonicated to an average size of 200–700 bp using a Bioruptor Pico ( Diagenode ) . Immunoprecipitation was performed using 15 μg of chromatin and 2 . 5 μg of anti-H3K27ac antibody ( Active Motif #39133 ) . DNA purification was performed using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit ( Thermo Fisher ) with DNA eluted in 80 μL of elution buffer . ChIP-seq libraries were prepared from 1 to 5 ng eluted DNA using NEBNext Ultra II DNA library Prep Kit ( New England BioLabs ) . Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 with single-ended 75 bp reads at the Barts London Genome Centre . ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data generated here or from external datasets ( Supplementary file 1 ) were mapped by trimming reads using Trim_galore ! and aligning to the mm10 genome assembly using Bowtie2 v2 . 1 . 0 ( Langmead and Salzberg , 2012 ) , followed by filtering of uniquely mapped reads . Data were normalised to total read count . ChIP-seq peak detection was performed using MACS2 v2 . 1 . 1 ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) with -q 0 . 05; for histone marks the option --broad was used . ATAC-seq peak detection was performed using F-seq v1 . 84 ( Boyle et al . , 2008 ) with options -f 0 t 6 . For multi-tissue DNAse-seq data , peak annotation files generated by ENCODE were used . RNA-seq data generated here or from external datasets ( Supplementary file 1 ) were mapped by trimming reads using Trim_galore ! and aligning to the mm10 genome assembly with Tophat v2 . 0 . 9 ( Trapnell et al . , 2009 ) using a transcriptome index from Illumina’s iGenomes . For ENCODE multi-tissue RNA-seq data , FPKM expression values were downloaded directly from ENCODE and the data were normalised by histogram matching . Processed CpG calls from publicly available BS-seq and TAB-seq data were downloaded from the respective GEO submissions ( Supplementary file 1 ) . To identify TE+ enhancers , coordinates for RLTR9 , RLTR13D6 , RLTR13D5 and RLTR13B elements were taken from the mm10 RepeatMasker annotation and filtered to remove elements either intersecting H3K4me3 ChIP-seq peaks or lying within 500 bp of a TSS from the NCBI RefSeq annotation . Enhancer-like elements were then selected if they intersected with all three of the following: H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks , ATAC-seq peaks and binding sites for any of three key TFs ( OCT4 , NANOG or SOX2 for ESC TE+ enhancers; CDX2 , ELF5 or EOMES for TSC TE+ enhancers ) . To define TE- enhancers , ATAC-seq peaks that did not overlap any TEs annotated by RepeatMasker were used as a basis for potential enhancer regions . These regions were then filtered in the same manner as described for TE+ enhancers . Non-enhancer TEs were defined as mappable elements displaying low ATAC-seq signal . Mappability scores were obtained by mapping in silico generated reads and measuring the proportion of the element’s length covered by uniquely mapped reads . Elements with a score higher than 0 . 5 were kept and from those with the lowest ATAC-seq signal selected as non-enhancer TEs . The number of elements selected for each class equated to twice the number of TE+ enhancers identified for the same class . To estimate how many ChIP-seq peaks could be missed due to low read mappability to TEs we used ChIPulate ( Datta et al . , 2019 ) to simulate ChIP-seq data . We generated reads for simulated peaks centred on each TE of interest , as well as control reads spanning 10 kb around each peak , with the following parameters: --read-length 40 --fragment-length 150 --fragment-jitter 40 . These reads were mapped back to the mouse genome followed by peak detection using MACS2 as described above . As a control , peak detection was also performed on the simulated ( pre-mapping ) data , which successfully detected all TE copies . Processed promoter-genome spatial interactions were downloaded from the respective ArrayExpress submission ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Each element of interest ( TE+ enhancers , TE- enhancers , non-enhancer TEs ) was intersected with the list of non-promoter restriction fragments in the PCHi-C data and coupled to the gene promoter ( s ) it interacted with . Expression values from RNA-seq data were assigned to each element based on these relationships . To distinguish the putative effects of TE+ and TE- enhancers , only genes interacting exclusively with one type of enhancer were considered . Motif analysis of TE copies was performed using the FIMO tool of the MEME SUITE v5 . 0 . 1 ( Bailey et al . , 2015 ) using the HOCOMOCO v11 TF motif database . Data from the FIREWACh enhancer reporter assay were obtained from the respective publication ( Murtha et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , FIREWACh uses a library of restriction-digested DNA fragments from accessible regions of the genome , which are cloned into a lentiviral plasmid containing a GFP reporter . The lentiviral library was transduced into ESCs , followed by sorting of GFP+ cells and sequencing of the cloned fragments . For our analysis , we used the coordinates of both the identified regulatory elements and the input library fragments . Processed allele-specific data from ATAC-seq experiments on 129 × Cast hybrid ESCs were downloaded from the respective GEO submission ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Peaks containing at least five reads in one of the alleles and an allelic ratio ( 129 reads/total reads ) larger than 0 . 8 or lower than 0 . 2 were selected as allele-specific regulatory elements . These were intersected with TE annotations to identify putative allele-specific TE-derived regulatory elements . RNA-seq data from the same cell line ( Supplementary file 1 ) were used to extract expression values for genes within 100 kb of allele-specific TE regulatory elements .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['chromosomes and gene expression', 'genetics and genomics']",elife-44344-v3,78,7248,7170,92.92307692307692

These sources of stress can cause breaks in the genome , which if left unrepaired can lead to cancer or cell death . One of the most accurate ways to repair a broken fragment of DNA is through recombination – whereby an undamaged copy of the sequence is located in another DNA molecule and used as a template to replace the missing fragment . DNA recombination is regulated by more than a dozen proteins that help recruit the enzyme RAD51 to sites of DNA damage , and trigger its search for complementary sequences of DNA . A molecule known as PALB2 binds to these DNA repair proteins and coordinates their activity . If PALB2 , or these other proteins become mutated , this can increase the risk cancerous growths in various tissues , including the breasts and ovaries . Having a better understanding of how this group of proteins control the repair process could therefore improve prognosis and advance cancer treatments . Now , Deveryshetty et al . have discovered a new and unexpected role for PALB2 within the recombination pathway . As well as binding to other repair proteins , PALB2 interacts directly with DNA , and this interaction was found to be an important part of the repair process . Even in the absence of RAD51 , PALB2 was still able to recombine short fragments of DNA sequence . PALB2 achieves this by initiating recombination using single strands of DNA or a DNA-like molecule known as RNA . This latter property may be particularly important if the molecular machines needed to replicate DNA and synthesize RNA collide on the same DNA molecule . This new role for PALB2 could lead to the discovery of other DNA repair mechanisms , and could be used to predict which PALB2 mutations are more likely to cause cancer . Patients who are at greater risk of cancer could then be treated with more advanced therapies , in order to increase their chances of recovery .","BReast Cancer Associated proteins 1 and 2 ( BRCA1 , −2 ) and Partner and Localizer of BRCA2 ( PALB2 ) protein are tumour suppressors linked to a spectrum of malignancies , including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia . PALB2 coordinates functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 during homology-directed repair ( HDR ) and interacts with several chromatin proteins . In addition to protein scaffold function , PALB2 binds DNA . The functional role of this interaction is poorly understood . We identified a major DNA-binding site of PALB2 , mutations in which reduce RAD51 foci formation and the overall HDR efficiency in cells by 50% . PALB2 N-terminal DNA-binding domain ( N-DBD ) stimulates the function of RAD51 recombinase . Surprisingly , it possesses the strand exchange activity without RAD51 . Moreover , N-DBD stimulates the inverse strand exchange and can use DNA and RNA substrates . Our data reveal a versatile DNA interaction property of PALB2 and demonstrate a critical role of PALB2 DNA binding for chromosome repair in cells . 
 Breast cancer associated proteins 1 and 2 ( BRCA1 , −2 ) regulate an efficient non-mutagenic pathway of chromosome break repair and are described as guardians of chromosomal integrity ( Venkitaraman , 2014 ) . They initiate RAD51-mediated homologous recombination ( HR ) ( Davies et al . , 2001; Moynahan et al . , 2001; Sharan et al . , 1997; Venkitaraman , 2000 ) and facilitate restart of stalled replication ( Badie et al . , 2010; Lomonosov et al . , 2003; Schlacher et al . , 2011 ) . BRCA2 belongs to a ubiquitous family of Recombination Mediator Proteins ( RMPs ) , which stimulate formation of recombinase filament on single-stranded ( ss ) DNA protected by ssDNA-binding proteins , like SSB and RPA ( Beernink and Morrical , 1999; Cox , 2007; Kowalczykowski , 2005 ) . The Partner and Localizer of BRCA2 ( PALB2 ) protein was discovered as a protein forming a complex with BRCA2 and regulating BRCA2 activity ( Xia et al . , 2006 ) . Like BRCA proteins , PALB2 is an essential mammalian protein linked to a similar spectrum of cancers and Fanconi anemia ( Ducy et al . , 2019; Pauty et al . , 2014; Xia et al . , 2007 ) . The PALB2 C-terminal WD40 domain interacts with BRCA2 ( Oliver et al . , 2009; Xia et al . , 2006 ) while the N-terminus forms a complex with BRCA1 ( Zhang et al . , 2009a; Zhang et al . , 2009b ) . The latter localizes at double-stranded DNA break ( DSB ) sites at earlier stage of repair , inhibiting an alternative pathway of non-homologous end joining and initiating homology-directed repair ( HDR ) through recruitment of PALB2/BRCA2/RAD51 ( Prakash et al . , 2015 ) . PALB2 is often described as the hub for a network of tumor suppressors ( Park et al . , 2014b; Sy et al . , 2009b ) . In addition to BRCA1 and −2 interactions , it contains a chromatin-association motif ( ChAM ) that interacts with histones H3 and H2B ( Bleuyard et al . , 2012 ) . PALB2 binds MRG15 protein , a component of histone acetyltransferase-deacetylase complexes ( Hayakawa et al . , 2010; Sy et al . , 2009a ) ; RAD51 and its paralogs RAD51C , RAD51AP1 and XRCC3 ( Dray et al . , 2010; Park et al . , 2014a ) ; translesion DNA polymerase η ( Polη ) during recombination-associated DNA synthesis ( Buisson et al . , 2014 ) ; an oxidative stress response protein KEAP1 ( Ma et al . , 2012 ) ; and RNF168 ubiquitin ligase ( Luijsterburg et al . , 2017 ) . PALB2 is ubiquitinylated in G1 phase of the cell cycle by KEAP1 and CUL3 , leading to its degradation , and , thereby , restraining its activity in S/G2 ( Orthwein et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , PALB2 is an RMP itself as it promotes the assembly of RAD51-ssDNA presynaptic nucleofilaments in the absence of BRCA2 in vitro ( Buisson et al . , 2010; Dray et al . , 2010 ) . PALB2 recruits Polη to DSB sites and stimulates recombination-associated DNA synthesis by Polη ( Buisson et al . , 2014 ) . Apart from protein-protein interaction domains , BRCA1 , −2 and PALB2 proteins also contain DNA binding domains ( DBDs ) , the function of which is poorly understood ( Buisson et al . , 2010; Dray et al . , 2010; Paull et al . , 2001; Pellegrini et al . , 2002 ) . Recently , studies of BRCA1/BARD1 complex interaction with DNA and RAD51 led to the discovery of the BRCA1/BARD1 role in RAD51-mediated strand invasion and D-loop formation ( Zhao et al . , 2017 ) . Most missense mutations in the BRCA2 DBD are pathogenic ( Guidugli et al . , 2013; Wu et al . , 2005 ) . Disruption of DNA binding in a BRCA2 truncation variant lacking the PALB2-binding motif leads to a significant HDR reduction ( Siaud et al . , 2011 ) . However , deletion of the BRCA2 DBD has a negligible effect when interaction with PALB2 is preserved , highlighting the functional importance of the previously reported DNA-binding property of PALB2 ( Buisson et al . , 2010; Dray et al . , 2010 ) . Two truncation fragments of PALB2 , T1 ( residues 1–200 ) and T3 ( residues 372–561 ) , bind DNA ( Buisson et al . , 2010 ) . While the precise mechanism of DNA interaction and its functional role remain unknown , several reports indirectly support its importance in DNA repair . For example , PALB2 truncation of 500 amino acids situated between the BRCA1 and BRCA2 binding motifs and containing both DBDs does not support BRCA2 and RAD51 foci formation in cells during DNA damage ( Sy et al . , 2009b ) . Since both the BRCA1-binding N-terminal and the BRCA2-interacting WD40 C-terminal domains are retained in this mutant , the results points to the potential importance of DBDs in PALB2 function . The importance of DNA binding was demonstrated for other RMPs , including bacterial RecFOR ( Korolev , 2017; Morimatsu and Kowalczykowski , 2003; Ryzhikov et al . , 2014; Sakai and Cox , 2009; Umezu et al . , 1993 ) and eukaryotic RAD52 ( Arai et al . , 2011; Seong et al . , 2008 ) . In the current study , we identified a major DBD of PALB2 ( N-DBD ) and specific amino acids involved in DNA binding . Mutations of only four amino acids significantly reduce RAD51 foci formation and the efficiency of HDR in a model cell system . PALB2 N-DBD by itself stimulates RAD51 strand exchange reactions . Surprisingly , we found that the PALB2 N-DBD supports both forward and inverse strand exchange even in the absence of RAD51 and can use RNA as a substrate . Altogether , our data reveal a novel activity of PALB2 and highlight the importance of PALB2 DNA binding in chromosome maintenance . 
 We identified major DNA-binding residues of PALB2 and demonstrated their critical role for HDR in cells . PALB2 is described as a scaffold protein linking BRCA1 with BRCA2 during HDR and interacting with many other chromatin proteins . However , the truncation variant with the preserved BRCA1 and BRCA2 binding motifs but without the middle portion of the protein , which contains DBDs , does not support BRCA2 and RAD51 recruitment to DSBs ( Sy et al . , 2009b ) . Recent studies suggest an alternative BRCA1-independent recruitment of PALB2 to DSB through direct interaction with RNF168 ( Luijsterburg et al . , 2017; Zong et al . , 2019 ) . However , this interaction is mediated by the C-terminal WD40 domain , which is preserved in the described above truncation mutant . A critical role of PALB2 DNA binding was also suggested by studies of the BRCA2 ( Siaud et al . , 2011 ) , where the ‘miniBRCA2’ construct , including only DBDs with two BRC repeats , was 3–4 times less efficient than ‘midiBRCA2’ which includes PALB2 interaction motif . Moreover , interaction with PALB2 alleviates the requirement of BRCA2 DNA binding , including a deletion of the entire BRCA2 DBD . Here , we demonstrate that mutation of only four DNA-binding residues of PALB2 reduces both RAD51 foci and overall HDR efficiency by 50% in the presence of endogenous BRCA1 and BRCA2 . Even at 8 hr post-IR siRNA PALB2 cells complemented with PALB2-146AAAA still display a defect in HR . We suggest that the mutant display a failure to repair a subset of DSBs due to its defective DNA binding . Therefore , PALB2 interaction with DNA is critical for recruitment of the BRCA2 and RAD51 to DSB sites and efficient DNA repair in cells . Secondly , we demonstrate that the PALB2 N-DBD stimulates RAD51-mediated strand exchange in vitro . N-DBD encompasses the RAD51 binding site , therefore , it can recruit RAD51 to ssDNA to initiate nucleation of nucleoprotein filament . DNA-binding of N-DBD plays a critical role in this process , as the DNA-binding mutant ( 146AAAA ) retains interaction with RAD51 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) but is unable to stimulate RAD51 binding to ssDNA ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Alternatively , the PALB2 N-DBD can support a DNA conformation favourable for RAD51 binding to ssDNA or/and nucleation of RAD51 filament , similarly to the prokaryotic RecOR proteins ( Bell et al . , 2012; Ryzhikov et al . , 2014; Sakai and Cox , 2009 ) . The most unexpected finding is the ability of PALB2 to stimulate strand exchange between homologous ss- and dsDNA fragments in the absence of recombinase . This process is protein-specific and is not a consequence of simple DNA melting and reannealing of separated strands in solution , since the PALB2 N-DBD does not unwind the DNA helix and promotes DNA annealing . PALB2-mediated strand exchange differs from that of supported by RAD51 , as it does not require ATP binding and hydrolysis and it is less efficient and not unidirectional . This reaction resembles that of the RAD52 ( Mazina et al . , 2017 ) . In the cited manuscript , RAD52 promotes inverse reaction much more efficiently than forward and seemingly faster than that by PALB2 in our hands . However , the substrates used in RAD52 studies differ from those used in the current work by the presence of the ssDNA tail in dsDNA . The reaction with a no-tail substrate appears to be less efficient than the one supported by PALB2 . Another distinction from RAD52 is the initial reaction rate , which was much faster in case of inverse reaction even with no-tail substrate for RAD52 . PALB2-mediated reactions are slower with no difference between forward and inverse reactions . Proteins supporting strand exchange , such as RecA and RAD52 , share several common features . They interact with both ss- and dsDNA through distinct sites located next to each other , they form oligomeric structures , such as recombinase-DNA filament or Rad52 ring structure , and they distort the dsDNA helix to initiate strand exchange with the bound complementary ssDNA . RecA stretches dsDNA ( Chen et al . , 2008; Leger et al . , 1998 ) , while Rad52 bends the DNA helix bound to the toroidal oligomeric ring ( Brouwer et al . , 2017 ) . The PALB2 N-DBD interacts with both ss- and dsDNA . Previously , we demonstrated that PALB2 immobilized on ssDNA beads efficiently pulls down non-homologous dsDNA ( Buisson et al . , 2010 ) . It is unclear whether ss- and dsDNA substrates are bound to the same sites of different subunits of a PALB2 oligomer or two different DNA binding sites on the same monomer . The presence of at least two other minor DNA-binding sites in the N-DBD suggests such a possibility . Higher affinity towards longer ssDNA ( Figure 1 ) and the FRET experiment ( Figure 8—figure supplement 1B ) support a model of wrapping long flexible ssDNA around an oligomer . In contrast , interaction with dsDNA is less length dependent ( Figure 1 ) . We can speculate that binding of dsDNA to more than one monomer in PALB2 oligomer can trigger DNA helix distortion . Thus , PALB2 shares several specific structural and DNA-interaction features with both RecA/RAD51 and Rad52 proteins and supports a protein-specific strand exchange reaction . At the same time , PALB2 does not support D-loop formation with supercoiled dsDNA opposite to a full length PALB2 . This may be a consequence of the inability to efficiently bind and distort supercoiled dsDNA plasmid through the secondary DNA-binding site . It is important to note one distinct feature of the PALB2 N-DBD: the secondary structure prediction ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) suggests a different folding of the N-DBD fragment than that of RecA-like domains or a Rad52 . The latter proteins are formed by α/β sandwich folds , while PALB2 N-DBD folding is predicted to be composed of only α-helices , which may form helical bundle-like structure similar to that of Hop2-Mnd1 ( Kang et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , PALB2 N-DBD represents a novel structural fold that supports strand exchange . While the functional significance of this property remains to be investigated , it further supports the involvement of PALB2 in specific DNA transactions during HDR , similar to the involvement of BRCA1/BARD1 in D-loop formation ( Zhao et al . , 2017 ) . It was shown that both PALB2 and BRCA2 stimulate Polη DNA synthesis within a D-loop substrate in vitro through the recruitment of the polymerase to the invading strand in the D-loop ( Buisson et al . , 2014 ) . Interestingly , DNA synthesis was more efficient in the presence of PALB2 than BRCA2 , while both proteins were shown be equally efficient in recruiting polymerase to DSB sites . PALB2 strand exchange may contribute to other steps of HDR such as second-end capture ( Mazloum and Holloman , 2009; McIlwraith and West , 2008; Nimonkar et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , PALB2 ( FANCN ) and BRCA2 ( FANCD ) are involved in replication-dependant removal of interstrand DNA crosslinks associated with Fanconi anemia ( Howlett et al . , 2002; Moldovan and D'Andrea , 2009; Xia et al . , 2007 ) . The strand exchange function of PALB2 may also be important for alternative DNA repair pathways . Indeed , PALB2 supports strand exchange not only with ssDNA , but with ssRNA substrates , and can be involved in transcription-initiated DNA repair . This hypothesis seems particularly attractive in light of the PALB2 interaction with MRG15 and its localization at the sites of actively transcribed genes Bleuyard et al . ( 2017 ) . 
 Target amino acids were mutated by site directed mutagenesis using Stratagene QuikChange protocol . Single , double , triple and four residues mutants were generated by single stranded synthesis ( Supplementary file 1B ) . PCR samples were subjected to DpnI digestion at 37°C for 6 hr and annealed gradually by reducing temperature from 95°C to 37°C for an hour with a 1°C drop per minute . DpnI treated PCR samples were transformed into chemically competent OmniMAX cells ( ThermoFischer ) . Mutations were confirmed by sequencing and plasmids were transformed into BL21 ( DE ) cells . Mutant proteins were expressed and purified exactly as described for wild type fragments . Fluorescence anisotropy experiments were carried out at room temperature with 5 nM fluorescein ( 6FAM ) -labelled DNA substrates ( Supplementary file 1C ) using a Synergy four plate reader ( BioTek ) . Titration with protein was performed by serially diluting protein in 40 μL of assay buffer ( 20 mM Tris-acetate pH 7 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 5% glycerol , 1 mM TCEP and 10% DMSO ) from 5000 nM to 0 . 3 nM and incubating with DNA substrate for 15 min at RT . Fluorescence anisotropy was measured by excitation at 485/20 nm and by monitoring emission 528/20 nm at room temperature using Gen5 . 0 ( BioTek ) software . An equilibrium dissociation constant was calculated with Prism software using one to one binding scheme , P+[D]=[DP] , where D is DNA and P is PALB2 . Anisotropy data were fitted by a non-linear regression analysis of Prism software using standard four-parameter logistic equation to identify Kdy=ymin+ ( ymax-ymin1+10logEC50-X×n ) Where , ymin and ymax is the minimum and maximum anisotropy values , X represents the log concentration of protein , n represents Hillslope , and EC50 is equal to KD . R2 is determined by the prism software by computing the sum of the squares of the distances of the points from the best-fit curve determined by nonlinear regression model . DNA annealing assays were performed with Cy5-labelled ss35 and compl IOWA-labelled ss35 ( 100 nM , Supplementary file 1D ) . The protein at 1 , 2 and 4 μM concentrations was mixed and incubated with Cy5-labelled ssDNA for 5 min at 37°C in 40 μL reaction buffer ( 40 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 20 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP ) . Reactions were initiated by addition of compl IOWA-labelled ss35 ( 100 nM ) in 40 μL of reaction buffer . Decrease in Cy5 fluorescence was monitored by measuring fluorescence at 680 nm by excitation at 635 nm on a Synergy four plate reader ( BioTek ) . DNA strand exchange assays ( 80 μl ) were performed with 35 bp dsDNA obtained by annealing of 5’-Cy5- and 3’-IOWA-labelled compl strands ( Supplementary file 1D ) and a 90mer ssDNA ( ss90 ) with a region homologous to the plus strand . Alternatively , FAM/Dabsyl 49 bp DNA was used . For the forward reaction , ss90 ( 100 nM ) was incubated with 2 μM ( or as mentioned in the figure legends ) protein for 10 min in 40 μL reaction buffer ( 40 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 20 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM TCEP and 0 . 02% Tween 20 ) at 37°C . Strand exchange was initiated by addition of 100 nM Cy5/IOWA-dsDNA35 ( or FAM/Dabsyl-dsDNA49 ) , the plate was immediately placed in plate reader and the intensity of Cy5 ( or FAM ) fluorescence was measured at 30 s intervals for 1 hr with excitation at 635 nm and emission at 680 nm . For reactions with RecA and Rad51 , an ATP regeneration system ( 2 mM ATP , 3 mM phosphoenol pyruvate and 30 U of pyruvate kinase ) was used ( Sigma-Aldrich , USA ) . Experiments without RecA and RAD51 were performed without ATP . For the inverse reaction , protein was incubated with Cy5/IOWA-dsDNA35 ( or FAM/Dabsyl-dsDNA49 ) substrate and reaction was initiated by addition of ss90 . The strand exchange assay with ssRNA substrate was performed as described above using a 60 ribonucleotide RNA ( Supplementary file 1D ) compl to that of 35 bp DNA . Alternatively , Cy3- and Cy5-labelled DNA oligonucleotides were used to prepare dsDNA substrate and the products were analysed by EMSA PAGE ( below ) . Fluorescent-labelled DNA products of strand exchange reactions were also analysed on EMSA PAGE . After fluorescence measurement on plate reader , the final reaction mix ( 80 μl ) products were deproteinated by incubation with proteinase K ( 0 . 5 mg/ml ) with 0 . 5 mM EDTA and 1% w/v SDS for 20 min at 37°C and the DNA fragments were separated on 10% PAGE gel in TBE buffer . The gel was imaged using a Typhoon 9400 image scanner ( GE ) and analysed with ImageJ software . FRET assay was performed in 96 well plate format . 100 nM of dual labelled dT70 or ss40 ( Cy5 at 5’ end and Cy3 at 3’ end ) was dispensed into 80 μL assay buffer identical to the buffer in the strand exchange assay ( Supplementary file 1D ) . Excitation was at 540/25 nm bandpass . Emission for both Cy3 at 590/35 nm bandpass and Cy5 at 680/30 nm were measured . PALB2 was added with final concentration between 4000 and 15 . 6 nM and incubated for 10 min .

A network of regions deep within the brain acts a little like an inbuilt GPS and tracks our position relative to other objects in the environment . Cells in one of these brain regions , called the entorhinal cortex , construct a map of our surroundings . The map resembles a grid of tessellating triangles , and the cells that produce it are called grid cells . Whenever we move onto a corner of one of the triangles , the corresponding grid cells start to fire . This firing enables the brain to track our movements . But grid cells may do more than support navigation through the physical world . They may also help us navigate through our memories . Evidence suggests that we organize our knowledge and experiences into mental maps . These maps connect related concepts just as physical maps connect nearby locations . In principle , the brain systems that support physical navigation may also enable us to access the information within our mental maps . But for this to be true , cells such as grid cells must respond to movement in mental space as well as in physical space . Wilming et al . have now tested this possibility by training macaque monkeys to detect a color change in a dot moving across a screen . The monkeys had to keep their eyes fixed on the center of the screen throughout the task . This meant they could not move their eyes to track the dot . Instead they had to mentally move the focus of their attention . Wilming et al . monitored the activity of cells in the entorhinal cortex as the monkeys mentally followed the dot . As predicted , some of the cells fired in a triangular grid-like pattern similar to that seen when animals move through their environment . Grid cells can thus fire in the absence of physical movement . These findings bring us closer to understanding how brain circuits that code for spatial locations also support other mental processes . Evidence from many sources suggests that structures within the brain’s medial temporal lobe , including the entorhinal cortex , contribute to memory . The next challenge is to identify how these brain regions encode spatial and other types of information and use them to form memories .","Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex allow for the precise decoding of position in space . Along with potentially playing an important role in navigation , grid cells have recently been hypothesized to make a general contribution to mental operations . A prerequisite for this hypothesis is that grid cell activity does not critically depend on physical movement . Here , we show that movement of covert attention , without any physical movement , also elicits spatial receptive fields with a triangular tiling of space . In monkeys trained to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a stimulus moving in the periphery we identified a significant population ( 20/141 , 14% neurons at a FDR <5% ) of entorhinal cells with spatially structured receptive fields . This contrasts with recordings obtained in the hippocampus , where grid-like representations were not observed . Our results provide evidence that neurons in macaque entorhinal cortex do not rely on physical movement . 
 Spatial representations , in the form of place cells and grid cells , have been identified in rodents ( Hafting et al . , 2005; O'Keefe and Dostrovsky , 1971 ) , bats ( Yartsev et al . , 2011; Yartsev and Ulanovsky , 2013 ) , macaque monkeys ( Killian et al . , 2012 ) and humans ( Jacobs et al . , 2013; Ekstrom et al . , 2003 ) . The hippocampal formation , however , also contributes to the processing of memories ( Squire and Wixted , 2011 ) , and conceptual similarities between spatial navigation and the processes involved in remembering and planning suggest that grid cells might support cognitive functions besides spatial navigation ( Buzsáki et al . , 2013 ) . This idea resonates well with the recent demonstration that grid cells are active during the exploration of images with eye-movements , that is by overt attention ( Killian et al . , 2012 ) . These findings revealed that grid cells do not only track an animal's location in space , but can also represent the gaze position of the animal . Shifts of gaze location usually correspond to shifts in attention ( Hoffman , 1998; Rolfs et al . , 2011 ) , and the neural substrate for overt and covert attention is largely overlapping ( Corbetta et al . , 1998 ) . Accordingly , grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are potentially capable of representing not only gaze location but the locus of attention in general . Here , we investigated whether firing fields of entorhinal cells are activated by movements of covert attention , in the absence of any physical movement . Attention functions as an important control for mental processes ( Petersen and Posner , 2012 ) ; accordingly , the hypothesis that grid cells participate in a range of cognitive functions predicts that grid cells may be activated by movements of attention . Here , we tested this prediction by recording from single units in the entorhinal cortex in monkeys trained to perform a task of covert attention . 
 To examine spatial representations of cells in the entorhinal cortex during the movement of covert attention , we recorded the neuronal activity of 141 neurons in the entorhinal cortex of two rhesus macaque monkeys performing a covert attention tracking task . The monkeys were trained to maintain central fixation while attending to a small ( 1° ) dot that moved around the computer monitor ( see Figure 1 ) . The task of the monkey was to respond by quickly releasing a response bar when the dot changed color . The color change occurred after a random time interval ( 700 – 2000 ms ) following trial onset . Over the course of a recording session , the dot traced out several Hamiltonian cycles , thereby ensuring that in the limit of infinitely many cycles each screen location was visited equally often . Monkeys performed the task at >70% accuracy , with the majority of errors due to saccades to outside of the fixation window . Depending on their motivation , monkeys completed between two and eight cycles per session . In order to examine spatial representations among entorhinal neurons , we evaluated the standard gridness measure ( Solstad et al . , 2008; Langston et al . , 2010; Brandon et al . , 2011 ) along with a novel analysis of the depth of firing rate modulation within the firing fields . Grid cells possess a regular firing field with increased firing rates at the nodes of equilateral triangles that evenly tile space . Importantly , tiling space with equilateral triangles leads to 2D autocorrelation functions with six peaks arranged in a hexagonal structure around the center peak . Whether or not a cell's firing field shows this regular pattern is usually evaluated by quantifying the 60° rotational symmetry of the 2D autocorrelation ( Solstad et al . , 2008; Langston et al . , 2010; Brandon et al . , 2011 ) . An important property of the gridness score is that the autocorrelation normalizes away the absolute firing rate modulation over space . That is , a cell that shows only a weak change in firing rate as a function of space might have the same gridness as a cell that shows a strong change in firing rate . The gridness score is therefore susceptible to noise , and homogeneous firing fields might produce high gridness scores by chance . Furthermore , for downstream read out of the grid signal the size of firing rate modulation , for example the signal to noise ratio is relevant . To better differentiate between noisy and grid-like firing fields , we computed for each cell an index of firing field modulation from its estimated rate map and a gridness score from its 2D autocorrelation function ( see Materials and methods ) . To assess the statistical significance of spatial representations in our recorded neurons , we computed the same indices on simulated cells with grid , place , or homogeneous firing fields . Cells were simulated by creating spike-trains with an inhomogeneous Poisson ( IP ) process ( Figure 2 ) . The rate function of the IP process was determined by the dot’s trajectory through a firing field and a noise parameter that varied the influence of noise for each simulated cell ( see Materials and methods ) . Simulated cells with a homogeneous firing field therefore control for any potential grid-like structure in the dot's trajectory . The resulting joint distributions of gridness scores and firing field modulation indices represent the likelihood of observing particular patterns of results . To differentiate grid cells , we computed the log likelihood ratio for comparing grid cells with place cells and homogeneous cells ( Figure 3 and Materials and methods ) . The resulting log likelihood ratio expresses how much more likely it is that a specific gridness score and firing field modulation index combination is produced by a grid cell compared to homogeneous or place cells . To control our false-discovery rate , we determined the appropriate threshold for classification performance on simulated non-grid cells . Out of 141 recorded neurons , we identified 20 cells ( 14% ) with a log likelihood ratio of >4 . 25 deciban ( corresponding to a false discovery rate <5% ) in favor of cells with spatially structured firing fields according to the two criteria of modulation index and gridness score . Cells classified as grid cells had a lower mean firing rate ( 0 . 47 Hz ) compared to those classified as other cells ( 1 . 22 Hz ) , and higher average gridness ( 1 . 29 vs . 0 . 51 ) and firing field modulation index values ( 0 . 1 vs . 0 . 04 ) . We also tested more conservative thresholds of 10 and 20 deciban ( false discovery rates of 1 . 26% and 0 . 07% , respectively ) , which require more evidence to classify a cell as a grid cell . Regardless of the threshold used , we were able to identify a population of neurons that were labeled as grid cells on an individual basis with high significance ( X2 ( 1 , N = 141 , FDR = 0 . 05 ) = 25 . 0 , p < 0 . 0001 , 20 , 9 and 3 cells w . r . t . to false discovery rates for different thresholds ) . We also identified candidate cells that qualitatively resembled grid cells but which could also be explained by assuming a noisy place like firing field ( lower right points in Figure 3 ) . We , furthermore , sought to validate our novel statistical approach with two different control analyses . First we recorded neuronal activity of 307 neurons from the hippocampus in monkeys performing the same task . There are currently no reports of grid cells in the hippocampus and these neurons can therefore serve as a baseline to determine our empirical false discovery rate . Classifying these cells with the same measures and the 5% FDR threshold yielded an empirical false-discovery rate of 8 . 5% . The FDR is slightly higher than the FDR derived from simulations because the hippocampal recordings likely contain a different ratio of spatially structured ( e . g . place cells ) to spatial noise cells . Yet , in the entorhinal cortex ( see above ) , we find significantly more grid-cells than expected from a FDR of 8 . 5% ( X2 ( 1 , N = 141 , FDR = 0 . 085 ) = 5 . 9 , p = 0 . 016; p < 0 . 05 for classifying with the 10 and 20 deciban thresholds as well ) . Second , we used a bootstrapping analysis to create a joint distribution of indices when the association between firing rate and the dot’s position is destroyed . To this end , we estimated the firing rate of each neuron along the dot’s trajectory and shuffled trajectory segments of 50 ms length ( 700 permutations ) . We again computed both indices and found an empirical false discovery rate of 5 . 5% . These control analyses suggest that our main analysis provides an adequate control for the false discovery rate . We calculated two further controls to eliminate the possibility that our results could be due to the specific set of trajectories used in each session . First , combining spikes generated by different firing fields destroys the spatial structure of the individual firing fields . Any residual grid-like spatial structure of a pooled unit is therefore due to the specific stimulus conditions . We therefore pooled all neurons in each recording session and calculated gridness scores and firing field modulation indices . None of these pooled units was classified as having a grid-like firing field ( average and max gridness score 0 . 36/0 . 96 , average and max firing field modulation 0 . 02/0 . 11 ) . Second , we investigated the spatial periodicity of trajectories in isolation . For each recording session , we pooled all trajectories and computed gridness scores and firing field modulation indices by assuming an equal firing rate at all locations . None of these units was classified as a grid cell ( average and max gridness score 0 . 1/1 . 17 , average and max firing field modulation 0 . 018/0 . 033 ) . These controls demonstrate that our results are not due to an inherent grid-like structure in the trajectories . As a last control , we examined whether our results might be confounded by the monkeys overtly tracking the dot with small eye-movements inside the fixation window within a trial . To investigate this , we compared the distance of the eye to the fixation cross with the dot’s distance to the fixation cross . If eye-movements tracked the dot’s position , these signals should be strongly correlated in each trial . However , we found no substantial correlations between eye-position and dot position . Average correlations within a session were small ( mean = −0 . 005 ) and within the expected range of correlations when we shuffled trials in time and thereby assigning eye-movement positions to dot trajectories from different parts within a session ( mean 0 . 001 , 5 and 95% percentile: −0 . 02 , 0 . 02 ) . We conclude that the monkeys did not track the dot with small eye movements . Systematic biases in receptive field size and position caused by hemisphere or eccentricity specific processing should show up as systematic biases in firing rate across the visual field . We therefore computed two asymmetry indices . The first quantifies the difference in firing rate between the right and left side of the visual field . While cells classified as grid cells ( 5% FDR ) in both animals showed , on average , increased firing rates on the contralateral side of the visual field relative to the recorded hemisphere , these differences were not consistent across cells ( mean contralateral-ipsilateral = 0 . 06 , t = −1 . 99 , p = 0 . 06 , one sample t-test ) . Second , we computed an index that compares average firing rate within the central five degrees of visual field around the fixation cross with the rest of the visual field . We again found no difference in firing rate ( mean center-periphery = 0 . 08 , t = 1 . 7 , p = 0 . 10 ) . These numbers , however , have to be taken with a grain of salt . In each monkey , we recorded from only one hemisphere , making an intra-monkey comparison of left/right visual field responses difficult . Furthermore , the experiment was not designed to optimize investigation of systematic changes with eccentricity . For such an experiment , monkeys trained to covertly track targets at high eccentricity and as well as having more recording time for each neuron with attention directed to eccentric locations would be desirable . These two constraints interact and make respective experiments highly challenging . An important caveat is that our experimental conditions are most sensitive for firing fields with a size that allows multiple repetitions of the grid on the screen . Larger firing fields might appear like place or homogeneous cells , and firing fields with spacing smaller than the spacing of our trajectories will appear as spatially structured noise . We can therefore make no definitive statements about the percentage of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex , and our results likely represent a conservative estimate . Future studies could address this issue by a ) using a larger screen to allow for larger field sizes and b ) using fixation locations that are not centered to compensate for the loss of visual acuity at large eccentricities . For example , repeating the current experiment with a larger screen and additional fixation locations at the current screen corners would increase the covered area four-fold . 
 In summary , our results provide strong evidence that the activation of cells in entorhinal cortex with spatially structured firing fields does not require physical movement through an environment . Previous results demonstrated that , in stationary monkeys , grid cells can be activated by eye movements as monkeys visually explore complex scenes ( Killian et al . , 2012 ) . Here , our findings suggest that even eye movements are not required to activate cells with grid-like firing fields and that firing fields in the entorhinal cortex cells can represent the location of attention . That spatial representations in the hippocampal formation can represent locations other than the animal’s current position has been shown in rodents through the identification of theta phase precession ( O'Keefe and Recce , 1993 ) and the demonstration that ensembles of hippocampal place cells fire in sequence within a theta cycle , representing places in front of and behind the animal ( Muller and Kubie , 1989; Skaggs and McNaughton , 1996; Jensen and Lisman , 1996 ) . More recent studies have shown that sequential firing of hippocampal place cells can represent anticipation of upcoming locations ( Diba and Buzsáki , 2007 ) , future possible paths when the rat is at a choice point ( Johnson and Redish , 2007; Singer et al . , 2013 ) , and even behavioral trajectories toward a remembered goal in a 2D environment ( Pfeiffer and Foster , 2013 ) . While it is difficult in rodents to assess the location of attention distinct from the location of the animal , these data are consistent with the idea that hippocampal sequences may reflect the animal’s attention being directed along a specific spatial trajectory . Paying attention to the just-completed trajectory could serve to enhance encoding of that experience . Correspondingly , directing attention to future possible paths could serve as a retrieval mechanism to enable optimal choice behavior . These findings also resonate well with reports of grid-like six-fold symmetric BOLD activity while participants imagine navigating in a familiar environment ( Horner et al . , 2016 ) , imagine directions between locations in a large-scale virtual city ( Bellmund et al . , 2016 ) , and navigate a purely abstract concept space ( Constantinescu et al . , 2016 ) . The data presented here demonstrate that entorhinal cells with grid-like firing fields can similarly encode information apart from the animal’s current location . In agreement with Killian et al . ( 2012 ) , we found a percentage of grid cells ( 14% ) that is lower than reports from recording in rats ( e . g . 32% in Sargolini et al . , 2006 ) . We see several possible explanations for this discrepancy . First , our task design is limited to detecting a subset of grid cells who’s firing fields match the size of the screen and the spacing of the dot’s trajectory , thereby potentially underestimating the true percentage of grid cells in macaque entorhinal cortex . Second , our task design does not attach significance to the spatial position of the dot . It is possible to solve the task without knowing where the color change occurs . Thus , it seems plausible that our observations reflect the entorhinal cortex in an attenuated state and that we would observe stronger grid cell activity if the precise dot position was relevant . Future work could address these points by enlarging the screen , including more fixation locations around which the moving dot needs to be observed , and by making the spatial position relevant . The latter might be achieved by introducing an invisible spatial reward field , such that the monkey does not need to detect a color change but only respond when the dot passes through high reward areas on the screen . A good strategy would thereby require integration of the spatial position of received reward to infer the layout of the reward field . Future experiments examining links between grid cell responses and behavior are critical for advancing our understanding of the function of the entorhinal cortex . 
 Each recording session consisted of the presentation of several cycles of the moving dot . Cycles were smoothed Hamiltonian cycles through a 23 × 23 grid with 1°spacing and therefore showed no center bias . Each cycle consisted of an average of 114 trials and took the monkeys an average of 13 min to complete . The speed of the dot changed as a function of the trajectory’s curvature , slowing down during corners and speeding up during straight parts . The average speed of a typical trajectory was 1 . 95°/s , with a maximum of 3 . 75°/s . Each trial ended with the correct detection of the color change , a missed detection , or when the monkey looked outside of the 4 . 5° × 4 . 5° central fixation window . In subsequent trials , the dot reappeared at its ending location from the previous trial . After the completion of a cycle , the next cycle was chosen randomly from a set of 100 precomputed trajectories . Excluding fixation errors monkeys performed the task at 85% accuracy across all sessions ( min = 70% , max = 94% , std = 8% ) and 87% accuracy across cycles ( std = 13% ) . We only analyzed data from trials with correct detection of the color change and constant fixation within the fixation window . The monkeys were head-fixed and seated in a chair such that the monitor's center corresponded to their neutral eye position . Spikes were recorded ( 40 kHz ) from the entorhinal cortex with a laminar electrode array mounted on a tungsten microelectrode ( 12-site , 150-μmm spacing; FHC ) . Rate maps were computed with a standard Gaussian smoothing procedure ( Killian et al . , 2012; Brandon et al . , 2011 ) . Gridness scores were calculated using standard equations ( 5 , 14–16 ) , but we additionally validated that our implementation was highly accurate in distinguishing grid from non-grid cells in simulated data ( see ‘Gridness score implementation’ , ‘Unit simulation’ , ‘Log likelihood ratios and classification of units’ and methods Figures 2 , 4 , 5 ) . We computed a firing field modulation index to separate spatially structured firing fields from homogeneous noise-dominated fields . The firing field modulation index captures how much of the spatial variation in firing rate can be explained by the mean firing rate over space:ffm ( g ) = ( ∑igi2−∑iμ ( g ) 2 ) /∑igi2where g is the two-dimensional rate map which is linearly indexed by i and μ ( g ) is the mean firing rate . Significance was established by computing the log10 likelihood ratio between the likelihood that a specific cell’s gridscore and firing field modulation index was produced by a noisy grid-cell or a cell with a noisy homogeneous or noisy place field like firing field ( see ‘Log likelihood ratios and classification of units’ ) . All experiments were carried out in accordance with protocols approved by the Emory University and University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees . We recorded neuronal activity in the entorhinal cortex in one male and one female monkey ( maccaca mulatta ) trained to perform a covert attention tracking task . Before each session , the monkey’s chair was positioned such that the eye-screen distance was 60 cm . Monkeys were head-fixed during recordings such that this distance never changed . Reward was delivered through a tube positioned in front of the monkey’s mouth and reward delivery was always accompanied by an auditory beep . The task required the monkeys to attend to a dot as it moved across the screen . The monkey's task was to maintain central fixation within a 4 . 5 × 4 . 5° window and to release a bar when the moving dot changed color . Gaze location was monitored with an infrared eye-tracking system ( ISCAN , Inc . ) , whose camera was placed underneath the screen . Each trial began with the onset of a central fixation cross . After the monkey fixated the cross for 300 ms , a moving dot appeared . The dot moved for a random duration between 700 and 2000 ms before it changed color ( from light gray to white on a dark grey background ) . After the color change , a bar release that occurred within 700 ms was counted as a successful detection . Early and late bar releases as well as fixational breaks were counted as errors . Upon bar release or 700 ms after the color change the moving dot disappeared . The monkey was rewarded with a food-based slurry on successful trials . In the next trial , which started 1 s after reward delivery , the dot continued on the same trajectory , i . e . starting from where it had disappeared in the previous trial . Monkeys worked for as long as they were well-motivated and completed between two and eight cycles per session . Monkeys were taught the covert attention task with the following sequence of simpler tasks . First , monkeys were trained in a fixation task in which they were rewarded for keeping fixation for some duration on the central fixation cross . As soon as behavior in the fixation task was stable , the dot was introduced behind the fixation cross and monkeys were now rewarded for releasing a bar when the dot changed color . As part of their general training and habituation monkeys had previously been taught a similar color change task , allowing them to transition to this task . In the beginning , the dot changed color after short durations ( 300–500 ms ) , which were prolonged until the final duration was achieved . Next , the experimenter manually moved the dot in small steps away from the fixation cross . This was practiced until monkeys would reliably fixate the fixation cross and detect color changes of the . The dot followed trajectories that visited different parts of the screen only once during the course of an entire cycle . Such trajectories are called Hamiltonian cycles and ensure that the distribution of dot locations is not biased to specific locations . To create such trajectories , we covered the screen with a matrix of 23 × 23 nodes ( 1° spacing ) that evenly covered an area of −11:11° of visual angle on the screen . We conceptualized this matrix as a graph where neighboring grid nodes are connected such that the dot can move along the vertices of this graph . Creating a Hamiltonian cycle now amounts to finding a sequence that visits all nodes in this graph exactly once . This problem is identical to the traveling salesman problem . Accordingly , each trajectory was created by using the Concorde ( http://www . math . uwaterloo . ca/tsp/concorde/ ) traveling salesman problem solver to find a path that visits each node of the 23 × 23 graph exactly once . We changed the random seed for each sequence to generate unique sequences . Next , we linearly connected all graph nodes to create path through the graph . The x and y coordinates of this trajectory were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel with σ = 60° to yield a smooth trajectory . The smoothing also ensured that the dot continuously changed its speed ( mean for a typical trajectory 1 . 95°/s , 3 . 75°/s maximum ) . At the beginning of a recording session and after completion of each cycle , the next trajectory was chosen randomly from a precomputed set of 100 trajectories . Stimuli were displayed on a 19’ CRT monitor with a refresh rate of 120 Hz . Spikes ( 40 Khz ) were recorded from the EC with a laminar electrode array mounted on a tungsten micro electrode ( AXIAL array: 12-site , 30 μm diameter , 150 μm spacing , FHC , Inc . ) with recording hardware from Plexon Inc . Subsequent analysis was carried out with custom MATLAB ( The MathWorks , Natick , MA ) and python code ( https://github . com/nwilming/ovtcvt [Wilming , 2018]; copy archived at https://github . com/elifesciences-publications/ovtcvt ) . Recordings from monkey MP ( male ) were carried out in the right hemisphere and recordings from monkey PW ( female ) were in the left hemisphere . Recording sites were planned with the help of MRI scans of each monkey and an atlas . Recording sites were located in the posterior part of the entorhinal cortex and close to the rhinal sulcus . Each recording started by slowly lowering a stainless steel guide tube containing the laminar array through a craniotomy . The array was then slowly advanced to its final position while the monkey conducted unrelated tasks . Recordings were started a few minutes ( ~10 ) after the array reached its final position to allow the tissue around the electrode to settle . Spikes were sorted using offline methods ( OfflineSorter , Plexon Inc . ) . We discarded units that did not show stable firing behavior through an entire cycle . In total , we analyzed 69 units from monkey MP ( seven sessions ) and 72 units from monkey PW ( eight sessions ) . See Table 1 . Neural recordings from the hippocampus were conducted in a similar manner . Four independently moveable tungsten microelectrodes ( 1 to 3 MΩ , FHC Inc . ) were lowered down into the hippocampus with the use of coordinates derived from MRI scans . Recordings took place in the left anterior portion of the hippocampus in one monkey ( PW ) and in the right posterior portion of the hippocampus in another monkey ( TO ) . Neurons were recorded from CA1-CA4 subfields , dentate gyrus , and subiculum . For the hippocampal recordings , we recorded from the covert attention task for two to six cycles per session following a ~ 1 hr recording during which monkeys freely viewed images . Rate maps and autocorrelation functions were computed analogously to Killian et al . ( 2012 ) . We computed 2D histograms of spike and dot positions with bins of size 0 . 5° × 0 . 5° . To estimate a firing rate map , we smoothed both histograms with a Gaussian kernel ( σ = 1 . 25° ) and divided the spike counts by the amount of time the dot spent in the respective locations . 2D autocorrelations were computed by shifting the firing rate map relative to itself and computing the coefficient of correlation for the overlapping maps . Our statistical analysis proceeded in several steps . Our goal was to classify the reconstructed firing fields of recorded units as grid-like or not grid-like . In a first step , we identified two measures of firing behavior that were suitable for this classification . In a second step , we estimated the joint distribution of these measures when the generating cell is either a noisy grid cell , a cell with a noisy homogeneous firing field or a noisy place field like cell . This allowed us to compute a log likelihood ratio that indicates whether or not a firing field is caused by a grid cell or by the other types of simulated cells . We then used the log likelihood ratio for classification of cells as grid cells or other cells . Both of these steps made extensive use of spike trains of simulated neurons . We therefore first describe our model for simulating spike trains and then describe the classification process . We simulated units by assuming that firing behavior is the result of an inhomogeneous Poisson process ( IP ) . This process allows to model different firing rates for different positions of the moving dot . The rate function of the IP is determined by a firing field , through which the dot passes , and a noise component . Sampling from the IP defined by this rate function yields artificial spike trains caused by the underlying noisy grid field . We simulated spike trains from noisy grid-like , noisy homogeneous or noisy place field-like firing fields . Grid-like firing fields were created by placingλ ( x , y ) =∑pϵP𝒩 ( ( x , y ) , [ ( px+o ) cos⁡θ−pysin⁡θ , ( px+o ) sin⁡θ+pycos⁡θ ) ] , σ ) P={3iDS , jD}∪{3 ( iDS+SD2 ) , jD+D2}∀i∈Z 2D Gaussian distributions at the nodes of a grid that tiles space with equilateral triangles: where λ ( x , y ) is the firing rate of the grid field at location ( x , y ) , D is the distance between peaks , S is a scaling parameter , θ rotates the grid field , o shifts the grid field and σ specifies the size of each grid node . The grid component of the rate function represents the firing rate in the firing field along several randomly drawn dot trajectories . The dot trajectories transform the 2D firing field into a 1D time- and space-varying firing rate . Simulated units were evaluated with the same pool of trajectories used for the recorded units . The noise component of the rate function is drawn from an exponential distribution ( rate = 1 ) for each location in the trajectory . The amount of noise and grid signal in the timeλ ( t ) =R[βsignalλGrid ( t ) + ( 1−βsignal ) λNoise ( t ) ]and space varying firing rate is governed by the parameter β signal : λGrid , λNoise are the grid- and noise-dependent components of the firing rate and are scaled to have an expected firing rate of 1 . βsignal , with 0 < βsignal <1 , specifies how much the grid signal contributes to the firing rate . R is the desired mean firing rate ( here uniformly sampled from the empirical firing rates ) . λ ( t ) is therefore the firing rate of the IP . Spike trains were then generated by producing a sample from the IP defined by the time- and space-varying firing rate λ ( t ) . The rate function has a temporal resolution of 120 Hz . Methods Figure 2 shows a graphical overview of unit simulations . We simulated 5000 grid cell units for each of nine different βsignal values ( i2 for evenly spaced i between 0 . 18 and 1 ) . All other parameters were drawn from random distributions:D∼u ( 7 , 16 ) σ∼u ( 1 , 2 ) θ∼u ( 0 , 90 ) S∼min ( 1 . 5 , max ( 0 . 5 , N ( 1 , 18 ) ) ) C∼u ( 2 , 6 ) o∼u ( −2 . 5 , 2 . 5 ) where C is the number of dot trajectories used for the simulation . Parameters are given in degrees of visual angle and ranges were chosen to allow broad coverage of potential grid-like firing fields . We discarded all firing fields that had less than three peaks in the area covered by the trajectory; these are a priori not recognizable as grid-like . This resulted in 27 , 450 units whose firing rate was determined by a grid-like firing field . We also simulated units based on spatially structured firing fields that were non grid-like . We used place-like firing fields that had only one peak by setting the spacing parameter of the grid-like firing fields to larger than twice the screen size . The standard deviation was randomly drawn from the interval [3 , 4] to allow large parts of the trajectory to be influenced by the place field . The scaling was set to 1 . We used 15 βsignal values ( i2 evenly spaced i between 0 and 1 ) and simulated 2500 units with each βsignal value . This resulted in 37 , 500 simulated units whose firing fields ranged from completely uniform ( βsignal = 0 ) to spatially structured fields ( βsignal > 0 ) . To summarize , we simulated a large range of plausible grid fields that can be resolved by our trajectories . In addition , we simulated cells with noisy homogeneous firing fields and cells with a noisy place-like firing field . Computation of the gridness score is analogous to ( Langston et al . , 2010; Brandon et al . , 2011 ) . In this computation , an ellipse is fit around six peaks in the 2D autocorrelation function and the rotational correlation is computed at 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 and 150 degrees . The gridness is then defined as:Gridness=min ( rc ( 60 ) , rc ( 120 ) ) −max ( rc ( 30 ) , rc ( 90 ) , rc ( 150 ) ) where rc ( x ) refers to the rotational correlation at angle x . Brandon et al . ( 2011 ) noted that this measure is sensitive to how the ellipse is fit in the 2D autocorrelation . Choosing the closest six peaks , for example , might include a peak that is due to noise in the firing field and omits a 'correct' peak that is further away . We used a two-step procedure to fit an ellipse . In a first step , potential ellipses that likely contain six peaks and six valleys were identified . This was achieved by predicting for a large space of possible grid fields where the most central peaks and valleys would be in the 2D autocorrelation for this grid field . Grid fields were parameterized by grid spacing , aspect ratio , size of the peaks , rotation of the grid field and shift of the peaks along the ellipse . Ther ( x , y ) =∑αϵPN ( ( x , y ) , μ ( α+L ) , σ ) +12∑αϵPN ( ( x , y ) , μ ( α+L+30 ) , σ ) P={0 , 60 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 300}μ ( α ) = ( t ( α ) xcosθ−t ( α ) ysinθ , t ( α ) xsinθ+t ( α ) ycosθ ) t ( α ) = ( −SDsinα , Dcosα ) prediction r ( x , y ) was computed according to the following equations: where D is the grid spacing , θ is the rotation of the grid field , σ describes the size of the grid peaks , S relates to the aspect ratio of the grid field and L describes the shift of the peaks along the ellipse . We constrained the set of candidate ellipses to those that passed through at least one non-central peak in the 2D autocorrelation . Methods Figure 4 shows several example predictions . The second step consisted of selecting ellipses that capture structure in the 2D autocorrelation . To this end , we computed the RMSE ( root-mean-square error ) between all ellipse predictions and the 2D autocorrelation functions . We then used a minimum shift algorithm to select ellipses that captured six peaks and valleys in the autocorrelation function better than ellipses in the local neighborhood of possible ellipses ( the window of the minimum shift algorithm is N/5 ) . The final gridness score was then the maximum of the gridness scores computed for these ellipses . To evaluate the power of the gridscore implementation to separate grid cells from non-grid cells , we computed gridness scores for all simulated units with grid-like firing fields . We then compared how well the gridscore separated units with firing rates determined by noise ( βsignal = 0 ) from those whose firing rate was at least partly determined by the grid firing field ( βsignal >0 ) . To this end , we computed ROC curves and used the area under the curve as a measure of discriminatory power . Methods Figure 5 shows these ROC curves and the AUC as a function of βsignal . To classify cells as grid-like we transform gridness scores and firing field modulation ( ffm ) index combinations into a single likelihood value . This mapping is derived via simulating many different random firing fields , place like firing fields or grid-like firing fields and computing gridness scores and ffm index values . This allows us to differentiate cells based on an estimate of the likelihood that a given gridness score and ffm index is generated by a grid-like firing field or other firing fields . To differentiate grid cells from non-grid cells , we computed the log likelihood ratio that compares the evidence that a gridscore and firing field modulation ( ffm ) combination is generated by a grid cell to the evidence that it is generated by a cell with a homogeneous or place field-like firing field:log10 ( Pgrid ( gridscore , ffm ) /Pnongrid ( gridscore , ffm ) ) The probabilities Pgrid and Pnongrid were computed from the simulation results with grid-like , place field-like and homogeneous firing fields . Since the gridness score and ffm index are continuous values , we locally pool simulated gridness scores and ffm indices to compute the likelihood . This pooling is carried out by a Kernel density estimate and the bandwidth ( size of pooling ) is determined via 10-fold cross validation . We thus estimated each probability distribution with a kernel density estimator and used these estimates to derive the likelihood estimates . Since the gridness score and firing field modulation measures are bounded , we applied a logit transformation to avoid boundary artifacts . We only considered units with βsignal > 0 . 15 as simulations of grid cells for the grid density estimate . Smaller βsignal values produced firing fields qualitatively close to those obtained with βsignal = 0 and thereby inflated the likelihood of observing small gridness scores and firing field modulation values from the grid cell simulation . Removing these units for the density estimation therefore makes our estimates more conservative . The log likelihood ratio expresses how much evidence we have that a particular gridness score and firing field modulation combination is produced by a grid cell relative to the evidence for place cells or cells with a homogeneous firing field . To evaluate the power of the log likelihood approach to separate grid cells from non-grid cells , we compared how well the log likelihood value separated units with firing rates determined by noise ( βsignal = 0 ) from those whose firing rate was at least partly determined by the grid firing field ( βsignal>0 ) . In analogy to our evaluation of different gridness scores , we used the area under ROC the curve as a measure of discriminatory power . Methods Figure 5B shows AUC as a function of βsignal in comparison to only using the gridness score . The log likelihood approach performed better than only using the gridness score for all noise levels . Figure 6 shows 2D autocorrelation functions and ratemaps for all EC cells .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials\xa0and\xa0methods']",['neuroscience'],elife-31745-v1,145,7134,6989,49.2

In fact , the lack of a social network may itself be a source of stress . Recent research suggests that young girls are more sensitive to social stress than boys . This could mean that social networks are more important for females in general , and that young females from different species , such as mice , may be more sensitive to social isolation than males . However , few studies have examined how social isolation affects the brain cells that control the release of stress hormones . As such , it remains unknown whether isolating individuals from their social group impacts on the brain in sex-specific ways . Senst , Baimoukhametova et al . now show that the brains of young male and female mice react differently to social isolation . Less than a day after separation from their littermates , the activity in the brain cells of female mice became markedly different from that of isolated males . In contrast to social isolation , the physical stress of being made to swim produced similar changes in the brains of both male and female mice . Further experiments then showed that the changes in the brain cells that control the release of stress hormones required a signalling chemical called corticosterone , which is produced in response to stressful situations . This suggests that , in repsonse to soical isolation , the females are experiencing more stress than the males . Following on from this work , one future challenge will be to investigate if reuniting a social group erases the effects of social isolation on the brain . Further experiments could also examine the behavioural and physiological effects of social isolation , including how females respond to later stressful events .","Many species use social networks to buffer the effects of stress . The mere absence of a social network , however , may also be stressful . We examined neuroendocrine , PVN CRH neurons and report that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of these cells in sexually dimorphic fashion . Specifically , isolating preadolescent female mice from littermates for <24 hr increased first spike latency ( FSL ) and decreased excitability of CRH neurons . These changes were not evident in age-matched males . By contrast , subjecting either males ( isolated or grouped ) or group housed females to acute physical stress ( swim ) , increased FSL . The increase in FSL following either social isolation or acute physical stress was blocked by the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor , metyrapone and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone . The increase in FSL results in a decrease in the excitability of CRH neurons . Our observations demonstrate that social isolation , but not acute physical stress has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons . 
 Survival threats trigger a repertoire of behavioral and endocrine adjustments ( Cannon , 1932 ) . The endocrine changes rely on the immediate engagement of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal ( HPA ) axis which is controlled by corticotropin releasing hormone ( CRH ) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus ( PVN ) . Although it is essential for survival , the dysregulation of the stress response is implicated in the emergence of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases ( Tost et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , many of these psychopathologies show sex-specific differences which may be a consequence of sexual dimorphism of the neuroendocrine response to stress ( Bale and Epperson , 2015 ) . This sexual dimorphism may result in different response sensitivity to the same stressor and/or differences in which stimuli males and females perceive as stressful . Human studies demonstrating that young girls exhibit greater corticosteroid ( CORT ) stress reactivity to social stress tests than boys ( Gunnar et al . , 2009; de Veld et al . , 2012 ) suggest , for example , that young females are more responsive to changes in social situations . Consistent with this idea , are demonstrations that , in comparison to males , females take greater advantage of social support and group dynamics to manage stress ( Taylor et al . , 2000 ) . Here we hypothesized that disrupting the social network would elicit neurobiological changes preferentially in female mice . 
 To test this idea , mice were housed in same-sex groups ( 3–5 animals per group ) from weaning ( p21 ) until the day of the experiment ( p22–35 ) . This developmental window allows us to interrogate the contributions of sex differences independent of the effects of circulating gonadal hormones ( Nelson et al . , 1990 ) . Mice were either in same-sex groups , pairs , or isolated from littermates for sixteen to eighteen hours . We then prepared hypothalamic brain slices and examined synaptic and intrinsic properties of identified CRH neurons in the PVN in acute brain slices ( Wamsteeker Cusulin et al . , 2013b ) ( Figure 1a ) . Activation of these cells is obligatory for launching the neuroendocrine response to stress ( Denver , 2009 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18726 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18726 . 006 The cellular heterogeneity in the PVN has necessitated various approaches to distinguish cell types . One of the most widely used has been to identify cells based on their voltage responses to a protocol of current steps . This reveals an ‘electrical fingerprint’ that has been used to distinguish among magnocellular ( oxytocin , vasopressin ) ( Tasker and Dudek , 1991 ) and parvocellular ( CRH , TRH , somatostatin ) neurosecretory cells ( Hoffman et al . , 1991 ) and pre-autonomic neurons . Reports of changes in the intrinsic properties of neurons following experimental manipulations ex vivo ( Shah et al . , 2010; O'Leary et al . , 2014; Kourrich et al . , 2015 ) , however , raise the possibility that electrical fingerprints are dynamic and potentially unreliable as a classification tool . We have recently described a transgenic reporter mouse in which CRH neurons can be identified and targeted directly for electrophysiological recording ( Wamsteeker Cusulin et al . , 2013b ) . In male mice , the electrical fingerprint of CRH cells was consistent with previous reports on parvocellular neurosecretory cells ( Wamsteeker Cusulin et al . , 2013b ) . These cells had a linear current voltage relationship and , unlike the magnocellular neurosecretory cells , did not have a long delay to first spike ( first spike latency ( FSL ) ) when depolarized from hyperpolarizing membrane potentials . We first examined FSL of CRH neurons from group-housed vs isolated mice . FSL can play a key role in integrating synaptic events and influence probability of firing ( Molineux et al . , 2005 ) and changes in the underlying currents can tune neuronal frequency ( Ellis et al . , 2007 ) . Social isolation had no effect on FSL in males ( malegroup: 48 . 7 ± 2 . 1 ms , n = 53 vs malesingle: 46 . 1 ± 1 . 8 ms , n = 76 , p=0 . 9; Figure 1b , c ) . By contrast , FSL in isolated females was significantly longer than FSL in group-housed females ( femalegroup: 45 . 1 ± 1 . 9 ms , n = 42; femalesingle: 65 . 6 ± 1 . 9 , n = 177 , p<0 . 0001; Figure 1b , d ) . We then conducted experiments in which female mice were housed in pairs prior to electrophysiology experiments . This manipulation revealed an intermediate phenotype , with pair-housed females exhibiting FSLs that were longer than those observed in group housed female mice , but shorter than those observed in single-housed female mice ( femalepaired: 56 . 5 ± 2 . 0 ms , n = 105 , p=0 . 0029 vs femalesingle and p=0 . 0017 vs femalegroup , F4 , 471 = 10 . 6 ) . There was no difference in the input resistance of isolated males vs isolated females ( malesingle: 796 ± 31 MΩ , n = 157 , vs femalesingle: 869 ± 23 MΩ , n = 273; unpaired t-test , p=0 . 063; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) or spike threshold ( malesingle: −51 . 5 ± 1 . 0 mV , n = 63 vs femalesingle: −51 . 3 ± 0 . 7 mV , n = 99; unpaired t-test , p=0 . 86; Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . We also examined properties of glutamate and GABA synapses on CRH neurons in hypothalamic slices from single-housed females and males . We observed no differences in basal glutamate ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) or GABA ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) synaptic transmission . These observations indicate that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in female , but not age-matched male mice . Next , we hypothesized that female mice , but not male mice , may interpret social isolation as a stress . If true , we reasoned that subjecting single-housed male mice to an acute swim stress should also increase FSL . In females , however , the prior isolation should occlude the effects of an acute stress . To test this idea , single -housed male and female mice were subjected to swim stress for 20 min and intrinsic properties of CRH neurons were assessed ( Figure 2a ) . Following swim stress , FSL in male mice ( maleswim ) was 64 . 0 ± 4 . 6 ms , n = 37 , Figure 2b , c; this is significantly longer than FSL in the single males reported above ( maleswim vs malesingle , 1 way ANOVA , p=0 . 0004 ) . FSL in single female mice subjected to swim stress was 65 . 8 ± 4 . 9 ms , n = 32 , Figure 2b , c; this is not different from FSL in female mice subjected to social isolation ( femaleswim vs femalesingle , p=0 . 67 ) . Finally , FSL in single males subjected to swim was not different from FSL in single females subjected to swim ( p=0 . 9 , Figure 2b , c ) . This suggests that either increases in FSL following social isolation occlude further effects of stress on CRH neurons or that females do not respond to swim stress . To test the effects of swim stress independent of any potential effects of social isolation , we conducted experiments in which group-housed females and males were subjected to swim stress . Following swim , FSL in group-housed males ( malegroup swim: 58 . 8 ± 2 . 8 ms , n = 23 , Figure 2d ) was significantly longer than FSL in naïve , group -housed males ( p<0 . 001 ) . FSL of group-housed males subjected to swim was not different than FSL in females subjected to swim ( femalegroup swim:58 . 7 ± 1 . 9 ms , n = 27 , p>0 . 05 vs malegroup , Figure 2d ) . Similarly , CRH neurons in group-housed females subjected to swim had a significantly longer FSL than CRH neurons in naive , group-housed females ( p=0 . 0001 ) . These observations demonstrate that both females and males show equivalent sensitivity to an acute physical stress ( i . e . forced swim ) . Additionally , a prior social isolation occludes the effects of subsequent physical stress on FSL in females , but has no effect on FSL in males . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18726 . 007Figure 2 .

FSL in single females subjected to swim is not different than single females ( p>0 . 05 ) . ( d ) Summary data show that FSL in group-housed males and females is not different ( p>0 . 05 ) . Group-housed males subjected to swim have longer FSL than group-housed , naive males ( p<0 . 001 ) and group-housed females subjected to swim have longer FSL than group-housed , naive females ( p=0 . 0001 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18726 . 007 Since stress increases CORT , we examined the relationship between circulating CORT and FSL . In order to assess CORT during a defined temporal window , we subjected single male mice to swim stress and obtained samples thirty minutes after the protocol . We noted a positive correlation between plasma CORT and FSL ( r2 = 0 . 3 , p=0 . 024 , n = 17 , Figure 3a ) . CORT , however , is one of many signaling molecules that is altered in response to stress . To determine whether CORT is necessary for increases in FSL following social isolation , we conducted experiments in which female mice were given access to drinking water containing the CORT-synthesis inhibitor , metyrapone prior to , and during , isolation ( Figure 3b ) . Metyrapone treatment blocked the effects of social isolation on FSL in female mice ( femalesingle metyrapone = 47 . 2 ± 2 . 0 ms , n = 24 , p=0 . 001 vs femalesingle , Figure 3c ) . Next , to determine whether CORT is necessary for increases in FSL following swim stress , we administered metyrapone prior to swim stress in single males ( Figure 3d ) . This eliminated the stress-induced increase in FSL in males ( malemetyrapone = 50 . 2 ± 2 . 4 ms , n = 35 , vs malevehicle = 66 . 7 ± 2 . 4 , n = 23 , p=0 . 007 , Figure 3e ) . These observations demonstrate that CORT is necessary for stress-induced changes in FSL in both males and females . In order to determine whether CORT is sufficient for increasing FSL , we incubated slices from either single-housed males or group-housed females with 100 nM CORT for 1 hr prior to electrophysiological assessment . This incubation time is sufficient to mimic CORT-dependent changes in synaptic metaplasticity observed after acute stress ( Wamsteeker Cusulin et al . , 2013a ) . CORT-incubation increased FSL in slices from single-housed males ( 59 . 2 ± 4 . 1 ms , n = 36 , p<0 . 021 vs malesingle ) and in slices from group-housed females ( 64 . 1 ± 4 . 8 ms , n = 32 , p<0 . 0001 vs femalegroup , Figure 3f ) . Collectively , these observations demonstrate that CORT is both necessary ( during stress ) and sufficient ( in the absence of stress ) to increase FSL in male and female mice . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18726 . 008Figure 3 .

( f ) FSL is increased following incubation of slices from single males ( p<0 . 021 vs malesingle ) or group-housed females ( p=0 . 002 vs femalegroup ) with CORT . There is no significant difference in FSL between the two CORT-treated groups . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18726 . 008 Next we investigated the underlying conductance that controls FSL in single-housed males and females . A rapidly activating , rapidly inactivating potassium ( K ) conductance contributes to FSL in a number of different cell types throughout the nervous system ( Meng et al . , 2011 ) . The channels responsible for this conductance are largely inactive at resting membrane potential , but this inactivation can be removed by a membrane hyperpolarization ( Yellen , 2002; Maffie and Rudy , 2008 ) . To test whether similar K channels contribute to the FSL in CRH neurons , we conducted experiments in which we did not deliver a membrane hyperpolarization prior to a depolarizing current step . The absence of this hyperpolarizing pre-pulse decreased the FSL in CRH neurons from socially-isolated females ( FSLnoHP: 37 . 8 ± 3 . 1 ms vs FSLHP: 55 . 3 ± 4 . 5 ms , paired t-test , p=0 . 0022 , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Rapidly activating and inactivating K currents are sensitive to millimolar concentrations of 4-aminopyridine ( 4-AP ) ( Alexander et al . , 2015 ) , and consistent with this , we observed shorter FSL in the presence of 2 mM 4-AP ( FSL4-AP: 36 . 8 ± 5 . 6 ms vs FSLcontrol: 62 . 8 ± 7 . 6 ms unpaired t-test , p=0 . 015 n = 8 , Figure 4a ) . We obtained voltage clamp recordings and characterized the currents responsible for regulating FSL ( malesingle n = 11 , femalesingle n = 12 ) . These currents were largely inactive at resting membrane potential , inactivated quickly and required membrane hyperpolarization to relieve inactivation ( Figure 4b ) . They were partially blocked by 2 mM 4-AP , fully blocked by 6 mM 4-AP ( n = 4 , Figure 4c ) , but were unaffected by a lower concentration of 4-AP ( 500 uM , data not shown ) ( Anderson et al . , 2010 ) . In addition , these currents were insensitive to 20 mM TEA ( data not shown ) . Neurons from socially-isolated females showed no difference in activation or recovery from inactivation in comparison to isolated males ( Figure 4d ) . There was no difference in current density in socially-isolated females when compared to socially-isolated males ( data not shown ) , arguing against an increase in channel number or conductance . We next asked whether channel kinetics might explain the differences in FSL . There was no difference in the activation kinetics between males and females , but currents from female mice had a longer decay time constant in comparison to males ( τfemale single: 55 . 8 ± 5 . 6 ms , n = 11 , vs τmale single: 41 . 9 ± 2 . 9 ms , n = 11 , unpaired t-test , p=0 . 019 , Figure 4e , f ) . These findings indicate that a slowing in the decay of a rapidly activating , rapidly inactivating voltage-gated K current is causative for the increase in FSL . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18726 . 009Figure 4 .

( a ) Traces on left show voltage responses to a depolarizing current step with ( orange ) and without ( gray ) a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse . The absence of a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse decreases FSL as summarized in b ( n = 29 , p<0 . 01 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18726 . 010 Next , we asked whether these differences in the biophysical properties of the rapidly inactivating K current observed in socially-isolated females compared to males would be sufficient to alter the spike output of CRH neurons . We conducted experiments in which depolarizing current steps ( 20 pA intervals ) were preceded by a hyperpolarizing pre-pulse . CRH neurons from female isolated mice required a greater depolarization to generate a spike compared to CRH neurons from socially isolated males . This is revealed as a rightward shift in the relationship between spike probability and current step ( female: I50 = 49 . 5 ± 1 . 2 mV , n = 104 vs male: I50 = 55 . 0 ± 1 . 6 mV , n = 88 , p<0 . 0001 , K-S statistic ) . Finally , we compared the excitability of CRH neurons from isolated females and males . We used a protocol ( hyperpolarizing pre-pulse followed by a family of depolarizing steps ) that allowed for maximal activation of the rapidly activating K current described above . The rightward shift in the F-I plot indicates that CRH neurons from isolated females had lower excitability in comparison to isolated males ( p<0 . 0001 , K-S statistic , Figure 5b ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18726 . 011Figure 5 .

 Our findings demonstrate that brief social isolation ( <24 hr ) affects the biophysical properties of PVN CRH neurons in a sexually dimorphic fashion . We report an increase in FSL and a decrease in neuronal excitability in socially-isolated female , but not in age-matched , male mice . By contrast , an acute physical stress ( swim ) increased FSL in group-housed females and single-housed males . In addition , social isolation occluded the effects of swim stress on female mice . CORT is both necessary for the isolation ( females ) and swim stress ( males and females ) induced increases in FSL and sufficient to increase FSL in the absence of stress . Finally , we noted the effect of social isolation was graded in female mice with paired mice exhibiting FSLs that were intermediate to those observed from group-housed or single mice . We examined the underlying conductance and report that it is sensitive to millimolar concentrations of 4-AP and insensitive to millimolar concentrations of TEA . In addition , FSL was profoundly sensitive to pre-hyperpolarizing pulses , which remove channel inactivation and make rapidly inactivating K channels available for opening in response to depolarizations . The features of these channels are consistent with Kv4 channels previously described in the PVN ( Lee et al . , 2012 ) . They do , however , exhibit a more hyperpolarized activation threshold in comparison to kinetically similar 4-AP sensitive channels reported in PVN parvocellular neurosecretory cells in rat ( Luther and Tasker , 2000 ) . We failed to note any differences in overall current density or voltage-dependent activation or recovery from inactivation . We did , however , observe an increase in the decay time constant of rapidly inactivating K currents in socially-isolated female mice compared to male mice , providing a potential underlying mechanism for the prolonged FSL in response to depolarization . The longer FSL we observed is not a classically defined characteristic of CRH neurons and , in fact , the absence of this delay has been used previously to categorize putative CRH neurons ( Hoffman et al . , 1991; Wamsteeker Cusulin et al . , 2013b ) . Our findings demonstrate that the biophysical characteristics of neurons are flexible and exquisitely sensitive to specific experiences . Whilst synaptic changes in the PVN ( Inoue et al . , 2013; Kuzmiski et al . , 2010; Wamsteeker Cusulin et al . , 2013a ) and other brain regions have been investigated , this is , to the best of our knowledge , one of the first reports of rapid intrinsic plasticity in neurons following acute stress . Our observations add to a number of observations that intrinsic ( synapse autonomous ) plasticity can have a profound effect on the output of neural networks ( Shah et al . , 2010; Kourrich et al . , 2015;O'Leary et al . , 2014 ) . In addition , as electrical fingerprints have been used to identify specific cell types , investigators should use caution when interpreting the data as the physiological or psychological state of the animal may have a dramatic impact on these fingerprints . Similarly , since neurons in the PVN can express multiple neuromodulators , caution must also be exercised when interpreting data from a genetically identified cell population . We have previously shown , using immunohistochemistry , that overlap between the genetically identified CRH cell population in PVN and non-CRH neurons is minimal ( <5% for vasopressin/CRH or oxytocin/CRH; <<1% for thyrotropin releasing hormone/CRH or somatostatin/CRH ) ( Wamsteeker Cusulin et al . , 2013b ) . These findings demonstrate that males and females react differently to some stressors but not others . Specifically , social isolation has definitive , CORT-dependent effects on CRH neurons in female , but not male mice . By contrast , both males and females show indistinguishable responses to an acute physical swim stress . These findings highlight the importance of carefully considering both the sex of the animal and the stressor modality when designing studies investigating neurobiological effects of stress . Indeed recent work demonstrating sex-specific expression of fear responses in rodents ( Gruene et al . , 2015 ) serves as a corollary to our observations and when taken together suggests that strategies for coping with stress are sex-specific . In particular , our findings highlight the importance of a social network in females and provides a neurobiological framework for further testing the underlying thesis of ‘tend and befriend’ strategy for females in response to stress ( Taylor et al . , 2000 ) . Finally , as our observations report sex-specific differences in response to stress in the first two weeks post-weaning , they provide clear evidence for biological effects on the stress axis that are independent of circulating gonadal hormones ( McCarthy and Arnold , 2011 ) . This exquisite sensitivity of the brain during the pre-adolescent period ( Foilb et al . , 2011 ) raises intriguing questions about the long-term consequences of subtle environmental and social manipulations on stress responses and behavior in males and females later in life . 
 All protocols received approval from the University of Calgary Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines ( Protocol # AC13-0027 ) . B6 ( Cg ) -Crhtm1 ( cre ) Zjh/J ( Crh-IRES-Cre ) mice and B6 . Cg-Gt ( ROSA ) 26Sortm14 ( CAG-TdTomato ) Hze/J ( Ai14 ) mice , whose generation has been detailed previously ( Madisen et al . , 2010; Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) , were obtained from Jackson Laboratories ( stock number 012704 and 007914 respectively ) . These were maintained as colonies of homozygous mice , with one backcrossing to C57BL/6J background strain following their arrival . Genotyping was used to identify mutants using PCR procedures provided by the supplier . The following primers were used to identify Crh-IRES-Cre mutants: 5′-CTT ACA CAT TTC GTC CTA GCC and 5′- CAA TGT ATC TTA TCA TGT CTG GAT CC-3′ and ( 468 base pair resultant PCR band ) . To identify Ai14 mutants: 5′-GGC ATT AAA GCA GCG TAT CC-3′ and 5′-CTG TTC CTG TAC GGC ATG G -3′ were used ( 196 base pair band ) . The age of pre-adolescent mice ( post-natal day 21–35 ) was determined according to previous literature demonstrating that in C57/BL mice the onset of puberty occurs at approximately 5 weeks of age ( Nelson et al . , 1990; Mayer et al . , 2010 ) . Mice were individually housed on a 12 hr:12 hr light:dark cycle ( lights on at 7:00 ) with ad libitum access to food and water . Pairs of either homozygous Crh-IRES-Cre or Ai14 genotypes were mated , and the resulting heterozygous Crh-IRES-Cre;Ai14 offspring used in subsequent experiments . Sixteen hours prior to the acute stress protocol or slice preparation , mice were housed either individually , in same-sex pairs or same-sex groups ( 3–5 mice per group ) . Single or group -housed mice were randomly assigned to naive or stress conditions . For stress experiments , mice were exposed to a forced swim stress ( between 8:00 and 9:30 during the light phase ) consisting of 20 min in a glass cylinder ( 14 cm internal diameter ) filled with 30–32°C water . Following one hour of recovery in their home cage , mice were anesthetized and brain slices were prepared as described below . Experimental animals were anaesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated . The brain was quickly removed , and coronal brain slices ( 250 μm ) containing the PVN of the hypothalamus were obtained using a vibrating slicer ( Leica , Nussloch , Germany ) while submerged in ice cold slicing solution ( 0°C , 95% O2/5% CO2 saturated ) , containing ( in mM ) : 87 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 0 . 5 CaCl2 , 7 MgCl2 , 25 NaHCO3 , 25 D‐glucose , 1 . 25 NaH2PO4 , 75 sucrose . Slices were then allowed a recovery period , of a minimum 60 min , in artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( aCSF ) ( 32 . 5°C , 95% O2/5% CO2 saturated ) containing ( in mM ) : 126 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 26 NaHCO3 , 2 . 5 CaCl2 , 1 . 5 MgCl2 , 1 . 25 NaH2PO4 , 10 glucose . The CORT synthesis inhibitor , metyrapone was dissolved in polyethylene glycol and injected i . p . 60 min prior to swim stress at a dose of 75 mg/kg in a volume of 50 μL . For female isolation experiments , CORT was dissolved in the drinking water ( 500 μg/ml ) and given for 24 hr prior to isolation and during the entire isolation period . Hypothalamic slices were transferred to a recording chamber and superfused with 30–32°C aCSF at a flow rate of 1–2 ml/min . Slices were visualized using an upright microscope ( BX51WI , Olympus ) fitted with infrared differential interference contrast optics . CRH neurons were identified by their expression of tdTomato . Whole‐cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from CRH neurons using borosilicate glass microelectrodes with tip resistance between 2–5 MΩ . The normal intracellular solution contained ( in mM ) : 108 K‐gluconate , 2 MgCl2 , 8 Na‐gluconate , 8 KCl , 1 K2‐EGTA , 4 K2‐ATP , and 0 . 3 Na3‐GTP buffered with 10 mM HEPES . For images of filled cells , 0 . 2 mM Alexa-488 hydrazide and 10 mg·mL−1 biocytin were added to internal solution . Microscope images were captured using a Retiga EXi camera ( Qimaging ) and processed using ImageJ . Recordings were amplified using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier ( Molecular Devices , Union City , CA ) , low‐pass filtered at 1 kHz , and digitized at 10 kHz using the Digidata 1322 ( Molecular Devices ) . Data were recorded ( pClamp 9 . 2; Molecular Devices ) and stored on a computer for offline analysis . During all experiments , initial access resistance ( Ra ) was below 20 MΩ . Cell membrane properties were monitored for the duration of the experiments and only recordings in which changes to Ra Cm did not exceed 15% were accepted for analysis . For synaptic experiments , the cell membrane was voltage clamped at −80 mV . Spontaneous inhibitory ionotropic GABAA receptor postsynaptic currents ( sIPSCs ) were isolated by blocking AMPA‐ and kainate‐receptor‐mediated glutamatergic synaptic transmission with 6 , 7‐dinitroquinoxaline‐2 , 3‐dione ( DNQX , 10 μM ) . When measuring spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) , the GABAA channel blocker picrotoxin ( 100 μM ) was included in the bath to isolate excitatory currents mediated by AMPA and kainate receptors . These spontaneous currents representing stochastic transmitter release were analyzed using MiniAnalysis 6 . 0 . 3 ( Synaptosoft , Decatur , GA ) . Event detection was set at three times the baseline noise and confirmed as synaptic events by eye . To determine RMP , cells were recorded in zero current ( I = 0 ) mode . Latency to spike initiation and firing thresholds were both measured using a current clamp depolarization step protocols . First , a baseline current injection that maintained the membrane voltage near −80 mV was chosen individually for each cell , which served to exclude the possible confounding influence of variable resting membrane potentials between cells . Next , a 200 ms/30 pA hyperpolarizing current injection was given followed by 250 ms/20 pA depolarizing current steps up to 140 pA . The latency time was measured as the duration from the point of initiating the depolarizing pulse to the initiation of the first spike . Firing threshold was determined as the membrane potential at the initiation of the first spike . Both firing threshold and membrane potential are corrected for a liquid junction potential of 12 mV , as calculated with solution ion concentrations . In experiments examining cell properties following 4-AP administration , baseline recordings were obtained , and then a ten-minute treatment period was allowed before secondary data were obtained . Synaptic currents were evoked by paired afferent stimulation ( every 5 s with an interstimulus interval of 50 ms ) and analyzed using Clampfit 9 . 2 ( Molecular Devices ) . Evoked postsynaptic current ( ePSC ) amplitudes were calculated from the baseline ( current before the first evoked response ) to peak of each evoked response . The paired pulse ratio ( PPR ) was calculated using the ratio of the amplitudes of the evoked pair ( peak 2/peak 1 ) from a minimum of a one-minute epoch within each cell . To isolate the voltage gated fast inactivating K current the following cocktail was applied to the slices for at least of 15 minutes prior recording: Bicuculline 10 µM , DNQX 10 µM , dAPV 50 µM , TTX 1 µM , TEA 20 mM . Each group represents a minimum of three animals for pharmacology experiments , or a minimum of four for stress experiments . Data points are presented as mean ± SEM . Statistical analyses for sIPSCs , and current clamp step data were performed in GraphPad Prism 4 using a one way ANOVA for multiple groups followed by a post-hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons test; unpaired student's t-test were used for two group comparisons , and a K-S statistic for comparing two distributions . Drugs were dissolved into aCSF daily prior to experiments from frozen aliquots stored at −20°C and added to the bath by perfusion pump . The drugs were dissolved in accordance with guidelines either in DMSO , PEG , ethanol or distilled water . DNQX , 4-AP , d APV and metyrapone were obtained from Tocris ( Tocris Cookson , Ellisville , MO ) . Picrotoxin , bicuculline , TEA and corticosterone were obtained from Sigma ( Sigma‐ Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . TTX was obtained from Alomone labs ( Jerusalem BioPark ( JBP ) , Hadassah Ein Kerem , P . O . Box 4287 Jerusalem 9104201 , Israel ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']",['neuroscience'],elife-18726-v1,284,6748,6464,23.760563380281692

This protein contains four subunits that can each bind to one molecule of oxygen , so a single hemoglobin can carry up to four oxygen molecules at the same time . Previous studies have found that , although each subunit can potentially bind oxygen on its own , the subunits actually work together to help each other bind to oxygen in the body . Two biochemical properties of hemoglobin affect how it carries oxygen molecules . First , oxygen-binding affinity , or how tightly the protein can bind to oxygen; and secondly cooperativity , or the degree to which the subunits interact with each other to bind oxygen more tightly . Mammals of different shapes and sizes have different requirements for transporting oxygen from the lungs to organ tissues , which have shaped their hemoglobin proteins over evolutionary timescales . While the contribution of affinity to hemoglobin evolution in animals of different sizes has been addressed in the past , the role of cooperativity in hemoglobin adapting to body size has remained unclear . Here , Rapp and Yifrach used a mathematical approach to analyze existing data from 14 different mammals – including mice , sheep , humans and elephants – on how oxygen binds to hemoglobin . Using this approach , they were able to explain why different mammalian hemoglobins present different oxygen-binding affinity and cooperativity values . Furthermore , they demonstrated that the cooperativity values were very close to the maximum they could be for each version of hemoglobin . These findings suggest that , as mammals evolved , genetic mutations that altered the oxygen-binding affinity or the ability of hemoglobin subunits to cooperate may have allowed hemoglobin proteins to adapt to meet the oxygen needs of mammals of different sizes and shapes . In the future , the approach used by Rapp and Yifrach could be adapted to study how other proteins that bind molecules in a cooperative manner have evolved .","Hemoglobin ( Hb ) represents a model protein to study molecular adaptation in vertebrates . Although both affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to Hb affect tissue oxygen delivery , only the former was thought to determine molecular adaptations of Hb . Here , we suggest that Hb affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptions that optimized tissue oxygen delivery . To test this hypothesis , we derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model and graphed the ‘biophysical Hill landscape’ describing this relation . We found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape that allows for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen . Our findings reveal the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb . The generality and implications of our findings are discussed . 
 Two major obstacles hamper understanding the evolutionary origins of properties seen in modern-day proteins . One stems from the fact that mutation and selection are separated by several levels of biological organization such that it is difficult to elucidate the complex relationships between protein sequence and organismal/population fitness . Second , even in those cases where the molecular properties of a protein ( e . g . affinity or cooperativity ) have adaptive value with respect to organismal fitness , we often lack an understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying changes in the values of these properties . Given these challenges , we currently understand the mechanisms underlying adaptive behavior for only a very limited number of proteins ( e . g . Mello and Tu , 2005; Keymer et al . , 2006; Swem et al . , 2008; Storz et al . , 2009 ) . Hb represents an excellent model protein to study molecular adaptation in vertebrates ( Perutz , 1983; Poyart et al . , 1992; Hourdez and Weber , 2005; Storz and Moriyama , 2008 ) . Hb is a tetrameric allosteric protein responsible for tissue oxygen delivery in a manner controlled by the midpoint and slope of its oxygen saturation curve . These macroscopic parameters reflect the effective affinity ( p50 ) and cooperativity ( nH ) of oxygen binding by Hb , respectively and are traditionally evaluated using the Hill equation , derived assuming an all-or-none mode of binding ( Hill , 1910 ) . Over the years , many studies have indicated that Hb oxygen affinity ( p50 ) is an adaptive trait , that is its value has been tuned during evolution so as to tailor tissue oxygen delivery to the particular metabolic requirements of vertebrates due to variations in body size , lifestyle and/or environmental conditions . For example , vertebrates native to mountain habitats where low ambient oxygen pressures prevail usually possess Hb that exhibits higher affinity for oxygen than does the Hb of lowland dwellers ( Lenfant , 1973; Bunn , 1980; Weber , 2007; Storz and Moriyama , 2008; Storz , 2016 ) . Likewise , Hb in small-sized animals that display high metabolic rates presents lower affinity for oxygen than does the same protein in large-sized animals , again reflecting the adaptive adjustment of tissue oxygen unloading by Hb ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer , 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen , 1970 ) . Accordingly , early respiratory system physiologists assigned great significance to the p50 parameter , terming it ‘oxygen unloading tension’ , and proposed that Hb function could be explained in terms of adaptive evolution of this value ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer , 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen , 1970 ) . At the same time , such studies ignored the adaptive potential of cooperativity ( nH ) with respect to Hb function . This is surprising , given that nH also affects Hb tissue oxygen delivery . Moreover , mechanisms underlying changes in p50 , such as changes in oxygen affinity of the oxy- or deoxy-states of Hb , changes in the ratio between these states or changes in their sensitivity to allosteric effectors , are all also expected to affect nH . Indeed , the finding by Milo et al . ( 2007 ) that mammalian Hbs exhibit variations in the Hill cooperativity value hints at the adaptive potential of the nH trait . The need to also consider nH in addressing adaptation of Hb function becomes evident when we examine the implications of accepting the notion that molecular adaptation of Hb function in vertebrates relies primarily on its p50 affinity property . Given the inherent tradeoff between arterial O2 loading and peripheral O2 unloading , it is not clear whether improved tissue oxygen delivery is achieved by increased oxygen affinity to improve Hb loading or by decreased affinity to favor unloading ( Storz , 2016 ) . Either very high or very low oxygen affinity would result in a low fraction of tissue oxygen delivery unless cooperativity ( nH ) between Hb subunits is introduced as a means to switch between low- and high-affinity Hb states . It would thus seem that the values of both p50 and nH of Hb should reflect physiological optimization of the tradeoff between O2 loading in the lungs and O2 unloading in tissues , so as to optimize tissue oxygen delivery . Although this is a seemingly obvious claim , it has yet to be tested experimentally . Here , we tested whether the values of both p50 and nH of Hb are indeed optimized in the case of body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb , relying on extensive evolutionary and physiological oxygen saturation datasets available for mammalian Hb proteins . The former comprises a set of oxygen binding curves of homologous Hb proteins from different mammalian species , all measured under similar physiological conditions ( Milo et al . , 2007; Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) . The latter comprises a set of binding curves of human Hb measured under a variety of different physiological conditions , that is , in the presence of different concentrations of H+ , CO2 and organophosphate , all inhibitory allosteric ligands of Hb ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) . For all data sets curves , reliable estimates for p50 and nH Hill parameters and for the elementary relative affinity ( c ) and conformational changes ( L ) parameters of the MWC concerted allosteric model ( Monod et al . , 1965; Rubin and Changeux , 1966 ) are available . By deriving the explicit mathematical dependence of both p50 and nH on the MWC parameters of a tetrameric protein , we were able to draw the theoretical ‘biophysical Hill cooperativity landscape’ at half-saturation that graphically describes how nH varies with changes in the values of the MWC parameters . The mapping of experimentally derived Hill and MWC parameters of all evolutionary and physiological dataset curves on this landscape provided insight into the mechanism underlying the adaptive behavior of p50 and nH with respect to tissue oxygen delivery by mammalian Hb and their relation to organism fitness . The principles underlying the ‘biophysical Hill landscape’-mapping strategy are general and offer mechanistic-level understanding of how physiological and evolutionary variations operate to shape the molecular property of a protein . 
 The evolutionary and physiological datasets for Hb used in the current study were respectively compiled in the meta-analysis of Hb function by Milo et al . ( 2007 ) and by Rapp and Yifrach ( 2017 ) . Specifically , the Hb evolutionary dataset comprises 14 different mammalian Hb oxygen saturation curves obtained under similar physiological conditions ( Materials and methods and Supplementary file 1 ) . The Hb physiological dataset comprises 26 different human Hb saturation curves collected under a variety of different physiological conditions , including those involving changes in H+ ( Di Cera et al . , 1988; Imai , 1983 ) , CO2 ( Doyle et al . , 1987 ) and 2 , 3-BPG ( bis-phosphoglycerate ) ( Benesch et al . , 1971 ) concentrations . For each dataset curve , the magnitude of cooperativity in oxygen binding was evaluated using either the Hill ( Figure 1a ) or MWC model ( Figure 1b ) . In the former , the sigmoidal saturation curve is fitted to the Hill equation ( Equation 1 ) ( Hill , 1910 ) : ( 1 ) Y¯=[S]nH[S]nH+K0 . 5nHwhere Y¯ represents the fraction of bound sites and p50 ( ~K0 . 5 ) and nH correspond to the midpoint and slope parameters of the curve . The Hill all-or-none binding mode corresponds to a simplification that is far from what occurs in reality . Instead , Hb oxygen binding generally involves intermediate ligation and conformational species , as delineated by the MWC allosteric model ( Marzen et al . , 2013; Monod et al . , 1965; Rubin and Changeux , 1966 ) ( Figure 1b ) ( see Appendix 1 for a detailed discussion on why we think the classical MWC allosteric model adequately describes hemoglobin oxygen ligation in the presence or absence of its allosteric ligands; see also Henry et al . , 1997; Milo et al . , 2007; Rapp and Yifrach , 2017; Storz , 2016 ) . According to the MWC model , tetrameric Hb is assumed to be in equilibrium between the un-liganded low-affinity T ( tense or deoxy ) and the high-affinity R ( relaxed or oxy ) states , as described by the L allosteric constant ( L=[T]/[R] ) . In the presence of oxygen , this equilibrium is shifted toward the R state in a manner determined by the ligation number and by the ratio of dissociation constants of oxygen from the two states , c ( c=KR/KT ) . These aspects of the MWC model are quantitatively described by Equation 2 ( Monod et al . , 1965 ) : ( 2 ) Y¯MWC= [S]KR ( 1+[S]KR ) 3+L [S]KT ( 1+[S]KT ) 3 ( 1+[S]KR ) 4 + L ( 1+[S]KT ) 4=a ( 1+a ) 3+Lca ( 1+ca ) 3 ( 1+a ) 4+L ( 1+ca ) 4where α in the non-dimensional form of the MWC equation denotes substrate ( S ) concentration in KR units ( α=[S]/KR ) . In the classical MWC model , cooperativity in substrate binding ( homotropic interactions ) is determined by both L and c ( Monod et al . , 1965 ) . Heterotropic interactions , on the other hand , describing the effects of allosteric ligands on substrate binding , only affect the L parameter . Hb conformational equilibrium can thus be further shifted toward the T state upon binding of allosteric inhibitors . Such dependence is described by Equation 3 assuming non-exclusive binding of the inhibitor ( I ) to both the T and R MWC conformations exhibiting KIT and KIR affinities , respectively ( Rubin and Changeux , 1966 ) : ( 3 ) Lapp=L ( ( 1+I/KIT ) ( 1+I/KIR ) ) 4 Reliable values for the L and c MWC parameters of all evolutionary dataset Hb saturation curves and for the apparent L values of all physiological dataset human Hb saturation curves were recently reported ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) and are given in Supplementary files 1 and 2 , respectively . Values for nH and p50 for the same dataset curves were previously reported ( Milo et al . , 2007; Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) . To describe the driving force ( s ) that shape Hb affinity and cooperativity oxygen binding properties , one must first derive the exact relationship between p50 and nH and the parameters of the MWC model . Accordingly , to bridge between the non-realistic Hill analysis and the MWC ligation pathway , we followed others ( Levitzki , 1978; Yifrach , 2004 ) and employed Equation 4 ( Wyman , 1964 ) on the MWC model equation under conditions of half-saturation: ( 4 ) nH=∂log ( Y¯1−Y¯ ) ∂ ( log⁡[S] ) =[S]∂ ( Y¯ ) /∂ ( [S] ) ( Y¯ ) ( 1−Y¯ ) Plugging the explicit mathematical expressions for Y¯MWC , 1−Y¯MWC and ∂ ( Y¯MWC ) /∂ ( [S] ) into Equation 4 yields the explicit mathematical dependence of nH on the L , KR and KT biophysical parameters of the MWC model . Earlier studies ( Levitzki , 1978; Yifrach , 2004 ) employed this analysis for assessing variations of a dimeric MWC protein to obtain analytic solutions for the dependence of nH on model parameters . Here , we solved for the tetrameric MWC protein case , yielding Equation 5: ( 5 ) nHMWC=∂ ( Y¯MWC1−Y¯MWC ) ∂ ( log⁡[S] ) = ( 4[S] ( ∂ ( Y¯MWC ) ∂ ( [S] ) ) ) |[S]=[S]0 . 5= ( 4[S] ( 3[S] ( 1+[S]KR ) 2KR2+ ( 1+[S]KR ) 3KR+3L[S] ( 1+[S]KT ) 2KT2+L ( 1+[S]KT ) 3KT ( 1+[S]KR ) 4+L ( 1+[S]KT ) 4 − ( 4 ( 1+[S]KR ) 3KR+4L ( 1+[S]KT ) 3KT ) ( [S] ( 1+[S]KR ) 3KR+L[S] ( 1+[S]KT ) 3KT ) ( ( 1+[S]KR ) 4+L ( 1+[S]KT ) 4 ) 2 ) ) |[S]=[S]0 . 5 The expression for [S]0 . 5 can be obtained by setting Y¯MWC ( Equation 2 ) to a value of 0 . 5 . Given that [S] is raised to a power of up to 4 , the exact analytic expression for [S]0 . 5 ( L , KR , KT ) is not manually solvable and was obtained using Mathematica software ( Wolfram Research Inc; see Materials and methods ) . Substituting the solution for [S]0 . 5 ( L , KR , KT ) in Equation 5 then allows obtaining the explicit expression for nHMWC in terms of the MWC model parameters . The long and complex expressions of both [S]0 . 5 and nHMWC can be found at the GitHub repository under the following address: https://github . com/OlgaRL/MWC_Parameters ( Rapp , 2019; copy archived at https://github . com/elifesciences-publications/MWC_Parameters ) . Thus , for any L , KR and KT values , nHMWC is unequivocally determined ( Equation 5 ) . A good approximation for nH ( based on the [S]0 . 5 expression of the R¯ conformational state function; Gruber et al . , 2019 ) that is over 98% accurate across most of the range of L and c values is presented in Appendix 2 . Plotting the three-dimensional surface of the Hill slope at half-saturation ( now referred to as nHMWC ) as a function of both logL and logc ( based on equation 5 ) generates what we refer to as the theoretical ‘biophysical Hill landscape’ for a tetrameric MWC protein ( Figure 1c ) . This landscape graphically describes the parameter space available for such a MWC protein and summarizes many of the known cooperativity-related aspects of the MWC model documented in classical papers ( Monod et al . , 1965; Rubin and Changeux , 1966; Edelstein , 1975; Perutz , 1989 ) and textbooks . In the Hill landscape , nHMWC values between one to four are obtained as a function of the L and c values chosen . The nHMWC surface presents a topology that resembles an upward-running ridge , with the maximum points obtained by introducing various L and c values ( as indicated by the trajectory drawn in red ) . Such mapping is better appreciated in the bell-shaped dependence of nHMWC on logL at a given logc value ( c = 0 . 01 , a value typical for human Hb ) , seen in a cross-section of such a surface ( Figure 1d ) ( Rubin and Changeux , 1966; Edelstein , 1971 ) . Inspecting the landscape cross-sections reveals that systematically higher maximum Hill points are obtained when higher L and lower c values are simultaneously chosen . Furthermore , as indicated by Rubin and Changeux ( 1966 ) , the different L and c value pairs underlying the maximum nHMWC points must all fulfill a particular dependence expressed by L = c -n/2 , as obtained by setting ∂nH/∂logL equals zero . Another important aspect of the maximum Hill points is that they reside at the apex of rather wide hilltops . This can be seen in the bell-shaped cross-sections of nHMWC as a function of logL at any particular logc value ( Figure 1c , d ) , suggesting that around the maximum cooperativity points , only minor changes in nH are to be expected upon changes in L brought about by binding of allosteric inhibitors or activators ( Equation 3 ) . This relative insensitivity of nHMWC to changes in physiological conditions was referred to as a ‘buffering of cooperativity’ phenomenon by the MWC model founders ( Rubin and Changeux , 1966; Edelstein , 1971 ) . Using the biophysical Hill landscape described here , we can now examine where evolutionary and physiological considerations have affected Hb behavior . Where along the three-dimensional nHMWC landscape can one find the ( L , c , nH ) points of the different binding curves of the evolutionary and physiological Hb datasets ? We first considered the 14 mammalian oxygen saturation curves comprising the evolutionary dataset . As can be seen in Supplementary file 1 , the different mammal Hbs exhibit variations in both L and c values , thus giving rise to different Hill values ( calculated based on the MWC model using Equation 5 ) . These values resemble the observed ‘Hill model’-derived coefficients ( Milo et al . , 2007 ) , as indicated by the linear correlation between the observed and calculated Hill values reported by Rapp and Yifrach ( 2017 ) ( Figure 1 therein; see also Supplementary file 1 ) . When mapped onto the theoretical Hill landscape , the calculated Hill values of all mammalian Hbs reside close to the maximum points of the bell-shaped contours of the three-dimensional Hill landscape ( Figure 2a ) . Furthermore , the logarithms of the values for L and c of the different Hbs are linearly correlated ( Figure 2b ) with a slope value of −2 . 7 ( ±0 . 3 ) , close to a value of −2 that would be expected for proteins that evolved to present maximum cooperativity in ligand binding ( L = c -n/2 ) . The observation that the logL-logc correlation crosses very close to the ( 0 , 0 ) axis origin point further supports this assertion . Given that L and c are independent parameters of the MWC model , the logarithms of their values for a given protein set are not expected to be linearly-dependent . This is , in particular , true if one considers that these values were derived using reliable data fitting strategies that prevent potential parameter dependence artifacts ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) and that changes in either c or L ( or in both ) were reported for native or mutant Hb variants over many years of Hb research . We thus suggest that the observed linearity between mammalian logL and logc values does not imply causation or is an artifact but rather points to co-evolution of the two MWC parameters so as to shape Hb cooperativity close to the maximum value . Deviation between the observed and expected slope values of the logL-logc correlation can be explained by differences in the techniques and experimental protocols used to evaluate the Hb saturation data from the different organisms and inaccuracies in data collection and analysis ( for detailed discussion , see Milo et al . , 2007 ) . Nevertheless , even with such limitations , the results derived from the evolutionary dataset support the hypothesis that changes in mammalian Hb binding and conformation have been tuned during evolution , giving rise to close to maximum cooperativity in oxygen binding , albeit yielding a different maximum nH value in each case . To further examine whether this indeed is the case , we considered the human Hb physiological dataset . As highlighted above , a buffering of cooperativity regime is observed around a maximum cooperativity Hill point . As such , minor changes in nH are to be expected upon changes in L brought about by the binding of allosteric inhibitors or activators . Reliable estimates for the apparent L values of all of 26 different concentration-related saturation curves of the H+ , CO2 and 2 , 3-BPG physiological datasets were recently obtained ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) , assuming a constant c value in each case , as predicted by the MWC model ( Supplementary file 2 ) . The different Lapp values obtained for each effector dataset saturation curve scales with effector concentration in a manner predicted by the MWC model ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017; Appendix 1 ) , confirming the reliability of the values derived . For the physiological Hb dataset , a cross-section of the biophysical Hill landscape at the characteristic c value of human Hb should be considered . We thus examined where along the bell-shaped human Hb nH-logL curve do the characteristic pairs of logL-nH values of the 26 physiological dataset curves reside . As can be seen in Figure 3a , logL-nH data points of the physiological dataset ( black symbols ) cluster around the maximum point of the bell-shaped curve . This pattern is in sharp contrast to the scattered pattern of the pairs of logL-nH values for Hb mutants reported in the literature ( gray circles ) ( Baldwin , 1976 ) and assumed by Baldwin ( 1976 ) ( and later by Fersht , 1985 ) to have the same c value . Significant deviations from the maximum cooperativity value of wild-type human Hb were also observed for naturally occurring Hb mutants , such as the Kansas and Chesapeake variants ( Edelstein , 1971 ) . A clustering pattern similar to that shown for human Hb is also seen for bovine and dog Hbs , despite being based on the limited physiological datasets available for these species ( Figure 3b ) ( Jensen , 2004; Breepoel et al . , 1981 ) . The clustering of all logL-nH experimental data points of the H+ , CO2 and 2 , 3-BPG datasets around the maximum point reveals that the Hill value for human Hb is relatively insensitive to changes in physiological conditions . Such nH-insensitive behavior was noted for the pH-related Bohr effect of Hb ( Wyman , 1964; Di Cera et al . , 1988 ) and later extended to other allosteric effectors of Hb ( Milo et al . , 2007 ) . Our results showing the invariance of nH with respect to logL thus provide a mechanistic explanation , based on the MWC model parameters , for the ‘buffering of cooperativity’ property of Hb . Such behavior should only appear if human Hb had evolved to present maximum cooperativity in oxygen binding ( Figure 1c , d ) . As site-directed point mutants of Hb are not subjected to the selection pressure that leads to maximum cooperativity , the values of logL-nH pairs for such mutants fall off the extremum point of the logL-nH cross-section ( Baldwin , 1976 ) . We next explored the potential evolutionary and physiological advantages of setting Hb cooperativity around the maximum nH point . We asked the following questions: Does the value of the maximum Hill point determine the sensitivity of Hb to tissue oxygen unloading ? Does the value of the maximum nH point affect the dynamic range of the buffering of cooperativity phenomenon ? How is Hb protein unbinding sensitivity changes within the buffering of cooperativity range ? To answer these questions , we turned to Equation 2 and the biophysical Hill landscape ( Figure 1c ) . Using the MWC equation , we generated ligand saturation binding curves exhibiting increasing maximum Hill cooperativity values ( Figure 4a ) . This was achieved by appropriate selection of L and c values ( indicated in Table 1 ) , all fulfilling the L=c-2 parameter criterion . To allow direct comparison , the saturation curves were plotted as a function of the scaled concentration α ( =[S]/KR ) , as is commonly done ( Monod et al . , 1965; Rubin and Changeux , 1966 ) . Under such conditions , the affinity and maximum Hill point are correlated ( Figure 4a ) . The higher the value of the maximum Hill point of the appropriate binding curve , the more it is displaced to the right along the scaled concentration axis . This is reflected in Figure 4b , showing monotonic correlation between the maximum Hill value and logα1/2 ( α1/2=[S]1/2/KR ) . It thus seems that under the maximum cooperativity parameter condition , a tradeoff exist between the cooperativity and affinity properties of a MWC-type protein . We next examined if and how this tradeoff affects the sensitivity of the protein for substrate unbinding upon chemical potential change . For each of the curves presented in Figure 4a , we considered the chemical potential difference ( Δlogα ) needed to achieve a constant reduction in the fractional saturation from 100 to 40% , as typically observed for mammalian Hb saturation under physiological lung and tissue oxygen pressures ( 100 and 40 mmHg , respectively ) . The ΔY¯100 → 40%/Δlogα parameter depends on both the affinity and cooperativity attributes of the binding curve and reflects the sensitivity of the MWC protein to substrate unloading . The narrower the difference in chemical potential that results in a 60% reduction in fractional saturation , the higher is the sensitivity of the protein to substrate unbinding . As can be seen in Figure 4c ( filled black symbols ) , the value for this parameter increases monotonically in a power law manner with increases in the value of the maximum Hill point . Similar results were obtained when other ΔY¯ ranges were considered ( e . g . ΔY¯100 → 20%; not shown ) . Higher maximum Hill points thus ensure higher sensitivity for substrate unbinding by the MWC protein . We next addressed the dynamic range implicated in physiology adaptation . The maximum nH points of the different curves shown in Figure 4a reside precisely at the apex of the appropriate bell-shaped nH-logL curve , calculated using the appropriate c value ( Figure 4d and Table 1 ) . As mentioned earlier , around this maximum nH point cooperativity is invariant to changes in L brought about by binding of allosteric modulators . To assess the broadness of the buffering of cooperativity regime around each maximum cooperativity point , we next generated a set of physiological dataset curves by systematically changing the value of L by several orders of magnitude , such that the resulting saturation curves exhibited essentially the same Hill value for ligand binding as did the original maximum Hill value ( less than a 1% change ) . This ensured that our analysis remained within the ‘buffering of cooperativity’ region , characteristic of each maximum Hill value ( see the yellow-marked logL range highlighted in each of the curves in Figure 4d ) . One such physiological dataset generated around the maximum point of human Hb ( nH = ~2 . 8 ) is shown in Figure 4e . For curves based on other maximum cooperativity points , see Figure 4—figure supplement 1 . For each of the different datasets , we calculated the logL range between the two extreme binding curves and defined this value ( ΔlogL ) as the broadness of the buffering of cooperativity regime , or the dynamic range for physiological adaptation where only affinity ( p50 ) matters . Plotting the dependence of ΔlogL on the maximum cooperativity Hill value ( Figure 4f ) reveals that higher maximum Hill values give rise to broader L ranges , where ‘buffering of cooperativity’ is observed . The maximum Hill point thus further controls the dynamic range of physiological adaptation . Lastly , we considered how protein sensitivity to substrate unbinding , as defined above , varied within the yellow marked buffering of cooperativity regime ( Figure 4d ) . Thus , for each set of fractional saturation curves calculated around the different maximum cooperativity points and residing within this regime ( Figure 4e and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) , we calculated ΔY¯100 → 40%/Δlogα . Variations in this parameter are plotted as open yellow symbols around each of the maximum cooperativity points presented in Figure 4c , with the lower and upper data points , respectively , corresponding to the lower and upper logL values defining the boundaries of this range . As can be seen , within this range , changes of up to 6% are observed in the value of protein unbinding sensitivity in response to changes in physiological conditions brought about by changes in L alone yet reflected in changes in p50 alone . The fact that different mammalian Hbs exhibit different maximum nH values ( Figure 2a ) , combined with the observation made above whereby systematically higher maximum Hill value gives rise to higher sensitivities to substrate unloading by MWC proteins ( Figure 4c ) , led us to hypothesize that the maximum cooperativity point of Hb has been tuned during evolution to satisfy the particular physiological requirements of different tissues for oxygen supply . We thus returned to the datasets comparing oxygen saturation of different mammalian Hbs ( all measured using similar methodology ) that revealed the linear correlation between animal metabolic rate and logp50 ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer , 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen , 1970 ) . We are aware that these data may not necessarily reflect functional effects on a single Hb form . Still , in cases where adult mammalian Hb expresses more than one variant , both usually present similar sequences and functional properties ( Storz , 2016 ) . Rather than taking the affinity-centric approach employed in the earlier studies , we instead adopted a complementary cooperativity-centric mindset and re-fitted all of the saturation curves to the Hill equation to derive both nH and p50 values for Hb of each animal ( Figure 5a and Table 2 ) . The derived nH values , although obtained under the slightly different physiological conditions typical of the blood of each animal , nevertheless correspond to maximum cooperativity values , as nH is relatively invariant to physiological changes around the maximum point ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . This assertion is further strengthened by the results shown in Figure 5b describing the linear relation between affinity ( logp50 ) and cooperativity ( nH ) , as expected for parameter values underlying maximum cooperativity ( Figure 4b ) . Finally , plotting either the affinity ( ~log ( 1/p50 ) ) or cooperativity properties of Hb as a function of the logarithm of metabolic rate of an animal yielded linear correlations in both cases ( Figure 5c ) . Specifically , the greater an animal’s metabolic rate , the higher was the observed maximum Hill cooperativity value of oxygen binding by Hb . Furthermore , as previously shown ( Schmidt-Neilsen and Larimer , 1958; Schmidt-Nielsen , 1970 ) , an inverse linear correlation was found between the metabolic rate and Hb affinity . These empirical observations directly relate the maximum cooperativity and affinity properties of Hb to an organismal-level trait that is related to fitness ( Dykhuizen et al . , 1987; Kacser and Burns , 1981; Bershtein et al . , 2017 ) . 
 Our findings revealed that mammalian Hb cooperativity values have been tuned during evolution to reside on a ridge of the theoretical biophysical Hill cooperativity landscape describing a MWC protein ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . These ridge-located Hill values all correspond to maximum cooperativity extremum points and were achieved by tuning of the relative affinity ( c ) and conformational ratio ( L ) of the T and R quaternary states of the protein ( Figure 2 ) . These maximum points are thus unique points along the Hill cooperativity scale continuum . There is no a priori reason to expect that physiological and evolutionary diversity in Hb would be reflected by this low dimensional ridge feature of the Hill landscape . As can be seen in the three dimensional Hill landscape , many combinations of L and c values can give rise to the same Hill value . Yet , only one of these combinations obeys the L = c−2 maximum cooperativity criterion . The observed variations in maximum cooperativity Hill values among mammalian Hb proteins thus reflect co-evolution of binding and conformational changes of Hb . Such tuning gives rise to a buffering of cooperativity effect , suggesting that the degree of cooperativity is robust to changes in physiological conditions brought about by tuning L alone ( Figure 3 ) . Our results thus reveal the evolutionary strategy underlying the observed variations in Hb behavior . The functional advantages of the balance between the relative affinity and conformational ratio of Hb quaternary states underlying the maximum Hill point become clear when considering that both the affinity and cooperativity parameters of Hb saturation curves affect tissue oxygen unloading . First , the c-L tradeoff gives rise to the highest possible Hill value for any given c value , thereby ensuring maximal oxygen unloading upon Hb transfer from the lungs to other tissues ( Figure 1cd ) . Either very high or very low L values would give rise to hyperbolic oxygen saturation curves with an nH value of one ( Figure 1c ) , which would ensure poor and unregulated tissue oxygen unloading by Hb . The same is true when c is assigned the value of one . Second , tuning the Hb maximum Hill point to higher values further leads to greater sensitivity to tissue oxygen unloading ( Figure 4c filled , symbols ) . Third , parameter adjustments that lead to higher maximum nH values also give rise to reduced Hb oxygen affinity ( p50 ) ( Figures 4b and 5b ) , thus reinforcing oxygen unloading upon Hb transfer from the lungs to other tissues . Indeed , the affinity-cooperativity tradeoff typical of the ridge of maximum cooperativity suggests that cooperativity can compensate for changes in affinity , with respect to tissue oxygen unloading , as usually described in any Biochemistry textbook . Fourth , the balanced parameter values give rise to the ‘buffering of cooperativity’ regime , thus ensuring that the nH-related oxygen unloading effect is not compromised in response to physiological changes brought about by variations in L and reflected as changes in p50 . Indeed , under such a regime , relatively minor changes in Hb sensitivity for oxygen release are expected in response to changes in allosteric effector binding ( Figure 4c , open symbols ) . Finally , the co-varied c and L values underlying maximum cooperativity allow for control of the broadness of the ‘buffering of cooperativity’ regime ( Figure 4d , f ) . Taken together , these points support the assertion that mammalian Hb nH and p50 values reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations that serve to optimize the tradeoff between O2 loading in pulmonary capillaries and O2 unloading in tissue capillaries , so as to optimize tissue oxygen delivery . Based on experimental ( Figures 2 and 3 ) and theoretical ( Figure 4 ) results , we suggest that evolutionary ( i . e . , across species ) variations allow for gross changes in Hb oxygen unloading sensitivity . Such changes are controlled by the maximum cooperativity and affinity values of Hb , in turn determined by changes in both L and c ( Figure 4c , filled symbols ) . Fine-tuning changes in Hb oxygen unloading sensitivity may further be brought about by physiological variations within the buffering of cooperativity regime , this time , however , reflected in changes in L and p50 alone ( Figure 4c , open symbols ) . The linear dependence between the metabolic rate of an animal and the maximum Hill value for Hb ( Figure 5c ) , combined with the results presented in Figure 4c , indicates that nH , like p50 , carries adaptive value with respect to mammalian Hb tissue oxygen unloading . As such , small body-sized animals presenting high metabolic rates require high oxygen supplies that can be more efficiently delivered by Hb presenting higher maximum Hill values . Considering that an animal’s metabolic rate is a trait related to organism fitness , we suggest that both the affinity and cooperativity traits of Hb represent low dimensional components of the fitness landscape , independent of other components . In this respect , the biophysical nH landscape of Hb can be regarded as a biophysical fitness landscape that serves to bridge the genotype-phenotype gap in assessing the relation between sequence variations in Hb ( that affect its affinity and cooperativity properties ) and their ensuing fitness effects ( Bershtein et al . , 2017 ) . Evolutionary tuning of mammalian Hb maximum cooperativity and affinity points , achieved by co-varying the relative affinity and conformational ratio of its quaternary states , thus regulates tissue oxygen delivery by Hb and serves as one mean to meet the distinct needs of different animal tissues for oxygen ( Figures 4 and 5 ) . Clearly , other mechanisms related to cardiac output and to convective and diffusive steps in the oxygen transport pathway are as well contribute to modulation of tissue oxygen transport ( reviewed in Schmidt-Nielsen , 1975 ) . For example , it has been shown that the capillary density of a mammal is also inversely correlated to body size ( Schmidt-Nielsen , 1975 ) . The buffering of cooperativity regime in Hb reflects the case where the fractional saturation curves of the protein seem parallel in shape and are only displaced along the substrate concentration axis in response to changes in effector ligand concentrations ( see Figure 4e ) . As revealed by Olsman and Goentoro ( 2016 ) , it is exactly this behavior the qualifies a MWC protein as a logarithmic sensor , reflecting the capacity of the protein to respond identically over a broad range of changes in chemical potential . Such behavior is in contrast to the case where the protein sensor responds to the absolute value of the signal intensity . Upon surveying the literature , Olsman and Goentoro ( 2016 ) found that many MWC allosteric proteins , including phosphofructokinase , Hb , cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels , Tar receptors , G-protein coupled receptors and EGF receptors exhibit a buffering of cooperativity or logarithmic sensing regime in response to changes in the concentration ( or magnitude ) of the modulatory allosteric signal . The dynamic range for this behavior can vary from 10-fold ( Hb ) to 10 , 000-fold ( GPCR ) . These findings suggest that all these MWC proteins evolved to present maximum cooperativity values in ligand binding and operate under the L = c -n/2 parameter regime that gives rise to the buffering of cooperativity phenomenon . However , other than Hb , the significance of this finding to organismal fitness is known only in the case of a single protein ( Keymer et al . , 2006 ) . Realizing the physiological advantage ( s ) of attaining the maximum cooperativity point of any protein and its relation to organismal fitness , is , of course , case-specific . Finally , the roadmap that underlies the ‘biophysical Hill landscape’-mapping strategy is general and can be applied to reveal the relation between evolutionary ( i . e . sequence ) and physiological ( e . g . changes in metabolite concentrations ) variations in shaping any molecular property of a protein . Although operating on different time scales and through different mechanisms , these traits are linked through the biophysical model describing the function of the protein . Elucidating this linkage requires extensive physiological and evolutionary datasets of the protein and that the steady-state biophysical model describing the function of the protein is known so that the explicit mathematical dependence of the molecular property under study on biophysical model parameters can be elucidated . This allows for constructing a ‘biophysical molecular property landscape’ onto which experimentally derived values of the macroscopic and microscopic parameters of all physiological and evolutionary dataset measurements can be mapped . Rationalizing the pattern of such mapping in terms of the relation between model parameters reflecting particular protein processes , such as catalysis , binding or conformational changes , might then reveal the driving forces that shape the molecular property under study . 
 The functional data analyzed here considered the evolutionary and physiology Hb datasets respectively complied in Milo et al . ( 2007 ) and Rapp and Yifrach ( 2017 ) . The evolutionary dataset comprised oxygen saturation curves of Hb from 14 different mammal samples obtained under similar physiological conditions . Using a three-equation system strategy ( Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 ) , the values for the L and c MWC allosteric parameters of all dataset curves were recently reported ( Supplementary file 1 ) . The physiological dataset comprised four independent human Hb sub-datasets , obtained from three different labs , with two reporting pH modulation , one considering CO2 modulation and the last addressing 2 , 3-BPG modulation , as discussed in the meta analyses by Rapp and Yifrach ( 2017 ) . These sub-datasets each include between 5 and 7 oxygen saturation curves obtained at different effector concentrations . Using global fitting analysis , we recently reported reliable estimates for the apparent L values for the different concentration-related physiological datasets curves ( see Rapp and Yifrach , 2017 and Supplementary file 2 ) . Cooperativity in oxygen binding by Hb was assessed using the Hill or MWC models , as quantitatively described by Equation 1 and 2 . The dependence of nH at half-saturation ( nHMWC ) on the MWC elementary parameters was obtained by applying Equation 4 to the MWC equation , assuming Y¯MWC equals ½ . Explicit solving for [S]1/2 in terms of KR , KT and L was obtained using the Mathematica 11 . 2 software package ( Wolfram research Inc ) . Substituting this expression in Equation 5 using the same software yields the explicit expression for nHMWC ( at half-saturation ) in terms of the MWC model parameters . It should be noted that nHMWC ( at half-saturation ) is an approximate measure of nH , maxMWC , the more natural Hill value for specifying homotropic cooperativity in the framework of the MWC model ( Rubin and Changuex , 1966 ) . In our analysis , we used nHMWC rather than the nH , maxMWC as the former is the actual parameter that is usually evaluated when fitting experimental data to the Hill equation ( Equation 1 ) . As for nH , maxMWC , the expression for nHMWC at half-saturation also exhibits a bell-shaped dependence on L , thereby also describing the characteristic ‘buffering of cooperativity’ effect . Furthermore , nH , maxMWC is equal to nHMWC exactly at the maximum cooperativity point ( Rubin and Changeux , 1966 ) . It should be emphasized that the nHMWC expression derived here relates to cooperativity in ligand binding ( as it is calculated based on Y¯ ) and is different than the expressions for nH derived in other studies based on the active state function ( R¯ in the case of an enzyme or P¯open in case of an ion channel ) and which relates to cooperativity of conformational switching ( Einav and Phillips , 2017; Martins and Swain , 2011; Marzen et al . , 2013 ) . For plotting the three-dimensional Hill landscape ( nHMWC ) as a function of both logL and logc , a constant KT ( =143 mmHg , the average value for KT in the evolutionary dataset ( See Supplementary file 1 ) and varying KR parameters were used . The Hill biophysical landscape shape , however , is invariant to other choices made for changing the relative affinity c parameter . Simulated MWC-based Y¯ data were generated using Equation 2 by changing the appropriate biophysical parameters ( KT , KR or L ) , as described in the text and in figure legends . For evaluating the sensitivity of oxygen unloading , simulated MWC-based Y¯ curves were first generated around several maximum cooperativity values by systematically changing c and adjusting L so as to fulfill the Lc2=1 maximum cooperativity criterion . Nevertheless , since scaled Y¯ curves are presented , the analysis is invariant to parameter choice . Around each maximum cooperativity graph , the dependence of nHMWC on the allosteric constant L was plotted assuming the appropriate constant c value in each case . To extract Y¯ data from previously published graphs , the WebPlotDigitizer net-based program was used . Only experimental data points were sampled unless the reported graph presented the experimental trend by a continuous line rather than scattered data points , as is typical of saturation data presented in older manuscripts . In such cases , the curves were evenly sampled by taking systematic steps along the x-axis . Y¯ data were fitted using either the Hill or MWC equations ( Equation 1 and 2 , respectively ) . The adequacy of fit was judged based on attaining a R2 coefficient greater than 0 . 97 .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']",['biochemistry and chemical biology'],elife-47640-v1,82,7643,7561,93.20731707317073

These so-called circadian rhythms are driven by an internal body clock and are essential for the organism to adapt to the daily cycle of light and dark . Circadian rhythms also take place inside individual cells – for example , the amount of a given protein in a cell often rises and falls over each 24-hour period . To generate these daily fluctuations , the processes used to make proteins based on the instructions encoded within a gene must be carefully controlled . Genes are first copied or ‘transcribed' into intermediate molecules called messenger RNAs ( mRNAs ) . These mRNA molecules must then travel out of the cell’s nucleus before they can be de-coded to produce proteins . This means that daily fluctuations in mRNA and protein levels could occur because the rate at which the DNA is transcribed fluctuates or because controlling the steps that occur after transcription . However it is not clear how much these post-transcriptional steps contribute to circadian rhythms inside cells . Recently , structures called paraspeckles were seen inside the nucleus . These structures are made from a long RNA molecule that does not code for a protein , and a number of proteins that can bind mRNA molecules . Paraspeckles are thought to prevent certain mRNAs from leaving the nucleus and therefore stop them from being decoded to make proteins . Torres et al . have now investigated whether paraspeckles may play a role in circadian rhythms . Torres et al . looked at the long non-coding RNA and several proteins that are known to be components of paraspeckles in cells taken from the pituitary glands of rats using a variety of techniques . These cells were chosen because they were known to have a working circadian clock . The analysis showed that the levels of these components , as well as the number of paraspeckles within the nucleus , changed over the course of a daily cycle . Torres et al . then confirmed that mRNAs containing a sequence that is known to recruit mRNAs to paraspeckes ( the IRAlu sequence ) could be also retained in the nucleus or released with a circadian rhythm . This pattern was lost when the paraspeckles were disrupted . These findings suggest that daily fluctuations in protein levels can be post-transcriptionally controlled by paraspeckles rhythmically retaining mRNAs in the nucleus . Future studies could explore whether it may be possible to control circadian rhythms by targeting the paraspeckles , which could help to improve conditions where the internal body clock goes wrong .","Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies form around the long non-coding RNA , Neat1 , and RNA-binding proteins . While their role is not fully understood , they are believed to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by means of the nuclear retention of mRNA containing in their 3’-UTR inverted repeats of Alu sequences ( IRAlu ) . In this study , we found that , in pituitary cells , all components of paraspeckles including four major proteins and Neat1 displayed a circadian expression pattern . Furthermore the insertion of IRAlu at the 3’-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA that was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted whereas insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect . Using real-time video-microscopy , these IRAlu were further shown to drive a circadian expression of EGFP protein . This study shows that paraspeckles , thanks to their circadian expression , control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level . 
 The circadian clock orchestrates daily rhythms in metabolism , physiology and behavior that allow organisms to anticipate regular changes in their environment , increasing their adaptation ( Asher and Schibler , 2011 ) . Circadian rhythms are underpinned by daily rhythms of gene expression . The transcriptional component of these rhythms is well understood ( Zhang and Kay , 2010 ) . The circadian variation in abundance of the positive ( Clock and Bmal1 ) and the negative ( Per1 , Per2 and Cry1 , Cry2 ) components of these loops drive the circadian transcription of both direct targets genome-wide and a cascade of circadian output transcription factors , which together mediate the circadian transcriptional profile of a cell type or tissue ( Asher and Schibler , 2011; Rey et al . , 2011 ) . Though the core circadian system has concentrated on transcriptional control , it has been apparent that substantial regulation is achieved after transcription so that post-transcriptional controls are emerging as crucial modulators of circadian clocks ( Lim and Allada , 2013; Wang et al . , 2013; Menet et al . , 2012; Koike et al . , 2012; Hurley et al . , 2014 ) . While in eukaryotes , approximately 1%-10% genes are subjected to circadian control directly or indirectly only ~1/5 of the mRNAs that display rhythmic expression are directly driven by transcription , which suggests that post-transcriptional mechanisms including RNA splicing , polyadenylation , mRNA stability , mRNA cytoplasmic export and RNAs nuclear retention are essential layers for generation of gene expression rhythmicity ( Partch et al . , 2014; Menet et al . , 2012; Koike et al . , 2012; Hurley et al . , 2014 ) . Paraspeckles are recently identified nuclear bodies that have been shown to retain RNAs in the nucleus . Paraspeckles contain proteins PSPC1 , RBM14 , NONO , and SFPQ ( Prasanth et al . , 2005 ) and are usually detected as a variable number of discrete dots found in close proximity to nuclear speckles ( Bond and Fox , 2009 ) . One long noncoding RNA , nuclear-enriched abundant transcript one ( Neat1 ) , exclusively localized to paraspeckles serves as a structural component ( Hutchinson et al . , 2007; Chen and Carmichael , 2009; Clemson et al . , 2009; Sasaki and Hirose , 2009; Sunwoo et al . , 2009 ) . The locus generates short and long transcripts from the same promoter , which have previously been identified as MENε ( Neat1-1 ) and MENβ ( Neat1-2 ) , respectively ( Guru et al . , 1997; Sasaki and Hirose , 2009 ) . Because specific depletion of Neat1-2 leads to disruption of paraspeckles ( Sasaki and Hirose , 2009 ) Neat1-1 alone cannot induce paraspeckle formation . Paraspeckles have been shown to retain in the nucleus RNAs containing duplex structures ( Chen and Carmichael , 2008 ) . This is the case for the mouse cationic amino acid transporter 2 ( Cat2 ) transcribed nuclear RNA , Ctn-RNA , an alternatively spliced form of the Cat2 mRNA , which contains a dsRNA structure resulting from inverted short inter-spersed nuclear elements ( SINEs ) in its 3’-UTR ( Prasanth et al . , 2005 ) . In human cells , hundreds of genes contain inverted repeated SINEs ( mainly Alu elements ) in their 3’-UTRs . Alu elements are unique to primates and account for almost all of the human SINEs and >10% of the genome . Their abundance leads to the frequent occurrence of inverted repeat structures ( inverted repeated Alu elements [IRAlus] ) in gene regions ( Chen et al . , 2008 ) . It has been reported previously that mRNAs containing IRAlus in their 3’-UTRs like Nicolin 1 ( NICN1 ) or Lin 28 are retained in the nucleus in paraspeckles ( Chen et al . , 2008; Chen and Carmichael , 2008 ) . Therefore , this nuclear retention pathway of IRAlus in 3’-UTRs of genes provides an additional layer of gene regulation by sequestering mature mRNAs within the nucleus . We recently reported that two protein components of paraspeckles , namely NONO and SFPQ , display a circadian expression pattern in primary cultures of pituitary cells as well as in a rat pituitary cell line , the GH4C1 cells ( Becquet et al . , 2014; Guillaumond et al . , 2011 ) . We used this cell line to determine whether one of the posttranscriptional mechanisms allowing circadian gene expression in pituitary cells could involve the circadian nuclear mRNA retention by paraspeckle bodies . To this end , we first characterized the presence of paraspeckles and we showed that these nuclear bodies were rhythmically expressed in the rat GH4C1 pituitary cell line . We then made a series of EGFP-fused IRAlu or Alu constructs and transfected them into GH4C1 cells to investigate the EGFP expression and the fates of the egfp-IRAlu or egfp-Alu RNA . We showed that an IRAlu element in the 3’-UTR of the egfp mRNA strongly repressed EGFP expression . Further , this reduction was accompanied by significant nuclear retention of the mRNAs , likely by paraspeckle bodies . We showed also that insertion of IRAlus in the 3’-UTR of EGFP reporter gene allowed rhythmic nuclear egfp-IRAlu RNA retention and rhythmic EGFP protein expression . Finally , this rhythmic nuclear egfp-IRAlu RNA retention as well as the rhythmic nuclear retention of some known cycling transcripts that were shown here associated with paraspeckles was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted . 
 Paraspeckles are found in almost all of the cultured cell lines and primary cultures from tissues ( Bond and Fox , 2009 ) , except for embryonic stem cells ( Chen and Carmichael , 2009 ) . Four RNA-binding proteins , including three members of the Drosophila melanogaster behavior human splicing ( DBHS ) family proteins ( NONO , PSPC1 and SFPQ ) and RNA-binding motif protein 14 ( RBM14 ) are classified as 'classical' paraspeckle protein components ( Bond and Fox , 2009; Prasanth et al . , 2005; Fox et al . , 2002; Nakagawa and Hirose , 2012 ) . Both endogenous and tagged forms of these proteins are found localized within the nucleoplasm as well as paraspeckles in mammalian cells . With a confocal fluorescent study , we report in a rat pituitary cell line that all four paraspeckle protein components are distributed both in the nucleoplasm and in subnuclear foci . Among these later , we identify paraspeckle nuclear bodies by overlapping side-by-side the staining of two paraspeckle protein components . This allows not only to provide evidence for the existence of paraspeckles in rat pituitary cell nuclei but also to show that as already reported in other cell types , paraspeckles are small , irregularly sized and unevenly distributed subnuclear bodies . Using RIP experiments , we further show that all four paraspeckle protein components are associated with the specific paraspeckle localized lncRNA Neat1 . This later is further detected by RNA FISH . Confirming previous reports in other cell types , when identified by a combination of Neat1 RNA FISH and confocal microscopy , paraspeckles appear as round foci in rat pituitary cells . The diameter of such round foci is in the range of that estimated in previous studies ( around 360 nm ) . However after use of a combination of Neat1 RNA FISH and STORM analysis , paraspeckles appear more likely as oblong structures with smaller dimensions reminiscent of the interchromatin granule-associated zone ( IGAZ ) that had been observed under electron microscope and had been reported to correspond to paraspeckles ( Cardinale et al . , 2007; Bond and Fox , 2009; Souquere et al . , 2010 ) . Width and height measurements obtained after STORM analysis of Neat1 RNA FISH staining are smaller than the dimensions of IGAZ nuclear bodies established by an electron microscopy analysis in human and mouse cells ( Souquere et al . , 2010 ) suggesting that either IGAZ/paraspeckle nuclear bodies are smaller in rat than in mouse cells or alternatively and more likely , Neat1 RNA staining does not fill in all the nuclear bodies as already proposed ( Souquere et al . , 2010 ) . In a previous study , we reported that two paraspeckle proteins , namely NONO and SFPQ , display a circadian expression pattern in rat pituitary cells ( Guillaumond et al . , 2011 ) and we find here that it is also the case for the two other 'classical' paraspeckle proteins , PSPC1 and RBM14 . Furthermore , all four proteins bind rhythmically to Neat1 , suggesting that the pools of proteins involved in paraspeckle composition vary with time . In addition , the lncRNA Neat1 itself displays a circadian expression pattern and we further found using a pair of primers allowing the specific detection of the long form of Neat1 RNA , Neat1-2 ( Figure 2—source data 1 ) that the expression of this form known to be sufficient for the formation of paraspeckle displays a circadian pattern ( data not shown ) . The circadian expression pattern of Neat1 RNA is not the privilege of 'in vitro' pituitary cells since it is also found 'ex vivo' in several mouse tissues including the pituitary gland but also numerous other peripheral oscillators such as the spleen or the adrenal gland . This holds also true for the central clock , namely the suprachiasmatic nuclei . Finally , in GH4C1 cells , the circadian variations in Neat1 RNA levels are shown here to reflect rhythmic variations in paraspeckle number within the cells . It may then be assumed that the circadian expression pattern of Neat1 RNA described here in a number of mouse tissue also reflects variations in paraspeckle number although it cannot be excluded that paraspeckle size could also oscillate over the circadian period both in pituitary cells and in other oscillators . As previously reported by Chen and Carmichael ( Chen et al . , 2008 ) , we found that a pair of IRAlus in the 3’-UTR of egfp can strongly silence EGFP expression in GH4C1 pituitary cell line and after fractionating cytoplasmic and nuclear RNAs from our two cell lines , we observed that IRAlus-containing egfp mRNA appear to be preferentially retained in the nucleus in comparison with those having a single Alu element . It then appeared that silencing EGFP expression mechanism relied on egfp mRNA nuclear retention . To obtain evidence that nuclear retained IRAlus are associated with paraspeckle bodies , we immunoprecipitated RNA complexes containing paraspeckle protein PSPC1 and characterized the associated egfp mRNA . We found IRAlu-containing egfp mRNA to be associated with PSPC1 whereas Alu-containing egfp mRNA was not . While PSPC1 as well as NONO and SFPQ accumulate in paraspeckles , these proteins are also found elsewhere throughout the nucleoplasm and thus may have functions apart from paraspeckle retention . In contrast to paraspeckle-associated proteins that are multifunctional , NEAT1 may have only one function . We then developed a technique to characterize nuclear mRNA Neat1 targets using a Neat1 RNA pull-down approach that allowed us to show the association of IRAlu egfp mRNA with Neat1 providing a much more convincing evidence for a nuclear retention of IRAlu egfp mRNA by paraspeckles . Given their presumed functions in gene expression through corresponding mRNA nuclear retention and since they display a circadian expression pattern , it may be assumed that paraspeckle bodies can rhythmically retain RNAs in the nucleus leading to a rhythmic expression of the corresponding gene . In keeping with this view , we showed that IRAlu elements inserted in 3’-UTR of egfp reporter mRNA allow for its circadian retention within the nucleus and consequently for EGFP protein circadian expression . However , it may be noticed that egfp mRNA displayed also a circadian nuclear retention when a single antisens Alu element was inserted in its 3’-UTR but in this case the variations of the ratio over the circadian period was highly reduced in contrast to the high amplitude circadian variations of the nuclear versus cytoplasmic ratio observed in IRAlu-egfp cell line . These small amplitude variations of the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA contents in Alu-egfp cell line were further accompanied by a weak number of cells expressing a circadian pattern of EGFP expression . Since antisens Alu elements within the 3’-UTR of mRNAs can be the target of several RNA-binding proteins ( Kelley et al . , 2014; Zarnack et al . , 2013 ) it may be speculated that some of these RNA-binding proteins display a rhythmic expression pattern accounting for the weak EGFP circadian expression observed in Alu-egfp cell line . Among the identified RNA-binding proteins that target antisens Alu elements within the 3’-UTR of mRNAs , HNRNPC was shown to display a circadian expression pattern in several tissues including the mouse pituitary ( see CIRCA: http://circadb . hogeneschlab . org/ ) . This is not the case for HNRNPU and STAUFEN 1 ( STAU1 ) -mediated messenger RNA decay we did not find to display a circadian expression pattern in GH4C1 cells ( Guillaumond et al . , 2011 ) and ( data not shown ) and are then unlikely involved in circadian EGFP expression in Alu-egfp cell line . The mechanism involved in the circadian nuclear retention of Alu-containing egfp mRNA remains anyway to be determined . Nuclear retention of egfp mRNA in IRAlu-egfp cells is no more cycling when paraspeckles were disrupted assuming that the nuclear retention of the reporter gene by paraspeckles contributes to cycling . To determine whether this paraspeckle impact on rhythmic gene expression occurs 'in vivo' on a much larger scale , we characterized in our pituitary cells the list of the putative Neat1 RNA target genes and we analyzed in publicly available datasets the known cycling transcripts that are included in this Neat1 RNA target list . Whereas it is well known that rhythmic circadian genes are tissue specific and that it is unfavorable to compare datasets obtained in two different species we found a robust overlap of our gene list with circadian genes in the mouse pituitary ( Hughes et al . , 2007 ) and a closer overlap with post-transcriptional circadian genes in the mouse liver ( Menet et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore , on a few circadian genes common to either of these lists or both , we showed a loss of rhythmic pattern when paraspeckles were disrupted assuming that paraspeckle retention plays a relevant role in circadian gene expression . It is now widely admitted that post-transcriptional circadian regulation plays a major role in determining oscillations at the mRNA level . In agreement with this view , the new mechanism described here suggests that circadian mRNA oscillations could be post-transcriptionally controlled through rhythmic nuclear retention by paraspeckle nuclear bodies . 
 GH4C1 cells , a rat pituitary somatolactotroph line , were obtained in 2012 from ATCC ( CCL-82 . 2 , lot number: 58945448 , Molsheim , France ) with certificate analysis and were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma ( MycoAlert , Lonza , Levallois-Perret , France ) . They were grown in HamF10 medium supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2% fetal calf serum . To synchronize cells between themselves , GH4C1 cells were transferred to fresh medium and were harvested after this fresh medium replacement ( T0 ) every 4 hr from T2 to T30-38 . For the generation of stable GH4C1 cell lines , cells were transfected with the plasmid constructs expressing a neomycin resistance gene by Lipofectamine Plus ( Invitrogen , Cergy Pontoise , F ) . Cells were selected with 250 μg/ml G418 ( Invitrogen ) beginning 48 hr after transfection . Alu and IRAlus elements from Nicn1 were cloned by PCR from genomic DNA obtained from Hela cells . Sequences were then inserted in the pEGFP-C1 ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) at the BglII and HindIII sites as described by Chen et al . ( Chen and Carmichael , 2008 ) . Predesigned siRNAs targeting rat Neat1 were purchased from GeneCust ( siRNA Set , GeneCust , Dudelange , Luxembourg ) . IRAlu-egfp cells plated in 6-well dishes were transfected with 500 pmol of a pool of four siRNA ( 125 pmol each , see Figure 2—source data 1 for the sequences ) using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies , Saint Aubin , France ) . As controls , 500 pmol of non-targeting siRNA from GeneCust ( negative control siRNA , see Figure 2—source data 1 for the sequences ) were used . Cells were harvested 48 hr after transfection . The antisense oligonucleotides ( ASO ) used for Neat1 knockdown experiments were phosphorothioate modified at their backbone to increase their stability . Two Neat1 ASO were pooled that were targeted to regions common to NEAT1_1 and NEAT1_2 isoforms ( see Figure 2—source data 1 for the sequences ) . IRAlu-egfp cells plated in 6-well dishes were transfected with 300 pmol of the pool of the two ASO ( 150 pmol each , see Figure 2—source data 1 for the sequences ) using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies ) . Cells were harvested 48 hr after transfection . Nuclear , cytoplasmic or total RNA was prepared from GH4C1 cells using an RNA XS kit ( Macherey Nagel , Hoerdt , France ) . Total RNA purification was performed on 24-well cell dishes . Nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA isolation was performed using 10 cm cell dishes that were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS , incubated in 1 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer A ( 10 mmol/L Tris pH 7 . 4 , 3 mmol/L MgCl2 , 10 mmol/L NaCl and 0 . 5% NP-40 ) . Nuclei and cytoplasma were separated by centrifugation ( 500 x g for 5 min ) . One-sixth of the supernatant was used to prepare cytoplasmic RNA . To obtain pure nuclear RNA , the nuclear pellets were subjected to two additional washes with 1 ml lysis buffer A and were then extracted with XS kit reagent . Total RNA ( 500 ng ) was then used for cDNA synthesis performed with a High Capacity RNA to cDNA kit ( Applied Biosystem , Courtaboeuf , France ) . Real-time PCR was performed on a 7500 fast Real-Time qPCR system ( Applied Biosystems ) using Fast SYBR Green mix ( Applied Biosystems ) . The sequences of the primers used in qPCR are given in Figure 2—source data 1 . mRNA accumulation was normalized relative to Gapdh mRNA levels . Total or nuclear protein extracts prepared as previously described ( Becquet et al . , 2001 ) from confluent GH4C1 cells grown in 10 cm dishes , were submitted to Western-blot analysis as previously described ( Guillaumond et al . , 2011 ) with polyclonal primary antibodies raised against PSPC1 ( 1:1000 , sc-84576 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Heidelberg , Germany ) , RBM14 ( 1 µg/ml , Abcam , Paris , France ) , ATF2 ( 1/1000 , sc-187 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , GFP ( 1/1000 , A6455 , Molecular Probes , Paisley , UK ) and monoclonal primary antibody raised against α-Tubulin ( 1/1000 , T 6199 , Sigma-Aldrich , Saint-Louis , USA ) . The ratio of PSPC1 and RBM14 to ATF2 , a constitutive transcription factor , and the ratio of GFP to tubulin were determined by densitometry using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health , USA ) . GH4C1 cells grown in 10 cm dishes were rinsed two times with 5 ml cold phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) . Cells were then harvested by scraping in ice-cold PBS and transferred to a centrifuge tube . After centrifugation ( 2500 x g for 5 min ) cells were pelleted and suspended in 100 µl of Polysome lysis buffer ( PLB; 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 1M KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 25 mM EDTA , 0 . 5% NP40 , 1 mM DTT , 100 U/ml RNAse OUT and complete protease inhibitor cocktail ) . After mixing by pipetting up and down , cells were kept on ice for 5 min to allow the hypotonic PLB buffer to swell the cells . The cell lysate was then aliquoted and stored at −80°C . Cell lysate was centrifuged at 14 , 000 x g for 10 min at 4°C and diluted 1/100 in NET2 buffer ( NET2 buffer corresponded to NT2 buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl2 and 0 . 05% NP40 added with 1 mM DTT , 20 mM EDTA , 200 U/ml RNAse Out ) . An aliquot of diluted cell lysate was removed and represented the starting material or 'input' which was processed alongside the immunoprecipitation to compare with immunoprecipitated mRNAs at the end . RIP experiments were performed overnight at 4°C on diluted cell lysate with antibodies to NONO ( ab45359 , Abcam ) , SFPQ ( ab38148 , Abcam ) , PSPC1 ( SAB4200068 , Sigma-Aldrich , Saint-Quentin Fallavier , France ) and RBM14 ( ab70636 , Abcam ) or non-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody ( anti-Furin , sc-20801 , Santa-Cruz Biotechnology ) . After incubation was completed , 15 µl of Magna ChIP protein A magnetic beads ( 16–661 , Millipore , Molsheim , France ) were added for 1h at 4°C . Beads were washed 6 times with cold NT2 buffer and treated by proteinase K for 30 min at 55°C . RNA eluted from beads was purified using Nucleospin RNA XS ( Macherey-Nagel ) and processed for cDNA synthesis using a High Capacity RNA to cDNA kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . Neat1 RNA pull-down is a hybridization-based strategy that uses complementary oligonucleotides to purify Neat1 RNA together with its targets from reversibly cross-linked extracts . In cross-linked extracts , it is expected that some regions of the RNA will be more accessible for hybridization than others due in particular to secondary structure . To design oligonucleotides that target these regions and then can hybridize specifically to Neat1 RNA , we modeled the secondary structure of Neat1 RNA using bioinformatics ( MaxExpect software [Lu et al . , 2009] ) . Two antisense DNA oligonucleotide probes that target accessible regions of the lncRNA Neat1were designed and used for Neat1 RNA specific pull-down ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . One biotynylated irrelevant probe was used for Neat1 RNA non-specific pull-down . All three probes were biotinylated at the 3′ end ( Figure 2—source data 1 ) . Briefly , 10 cm cell dishes were incubated in 1 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer A as described above . Nuclei were scraped and separated by centrifugation ( 500 x g for 5 min ) . The nuclear pellets were then fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature . Crosslinking was then quenched with 1 . 25 M glycine for 5 min . Cross-linked nuclei were rinsed two times again with PBS and pelleted at 500 x g . Nuclear pellets were stored at −80°C . To prepare lysates , nuclear pellets were suspended in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 10 mM EDTA , 1% SDS added with a protease inhibitor cocktail and RNAse-Out ) , and sonicated using BioruptorPlus ( Diagenode , Seraing , Belgium ) by 2 pulses of 30 s allowing complete lysate solubilization . RNA was in the size range of 400 to 2000 nucleotides . Nuclear lysates were diluted V/V in hybridization buffer ( 750 mM NaCl , 1% SDS , 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA , 15% formamide ) . The two specific or the non-specific probes ( 100 pmol ) were added to 1 . 2 ml of diluted lysate , which was mixed by end-to-end rotation at room temperature 4 to 6 hr . Streptavidin-magnetic C1 beads ( Dynabeads My OneStreptavidin C1– Invitrogen Life Technologies ) were added to hybridization reaction ( 50 μl per 100 pmol of probes ) and the whole reaction was mixed overnight at room temperature . Beads–biotin-probes–RNA adducts were captured by magnets ( Invitrogen ) and washed five times with a wash buffer ( 2×SSC , 0 . 5% SDS ) . After the last wash , buffer was removed carefully . For RNA elution , beads were suspended in 100 μl RNA proteinase K buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 0 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5% SDS ) and 100 μg proteinase K ( Ambion ) . After incubation at 45°C for 45 min , RNA was isolated using NucleoSpinRNA XS ( Macherey-Nagel ) . Eluted RNA was subject to RNA-sequencing or RT–qPCR for the detection of enriched transcripts . The construction of Illumina DNA libraries from RNA pools obtained with each of the two specific oligonucleotides and the sequencing were performed by Helixio ( Clermont-Ferrand , France ) . Libraries were prepared with Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit . Sequencing was done on Illumina NextSeq 500 ( 60 million reads per sample on average ) . Analyses were performed on a local instance of Galaxy ( Afgan et al . , 2016 ) . Paired-end reads ( 75bp ) were aligned to the Rat reference genome ( Rnor_6 . 0 . 80 , Ensembl ) using TopHat2 v2 . 209 with default parameters ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) . We further used Cuffflinks v2 . 2 . 1 ( Trapnell et al . , 2012 ) to quantify mRNA level and fragment per kilobase per million of mapped reads ( FPKM ) were calculated . Consistent with prior studies ( Nagaraj et al . , 2011; Hart et al . , 2013 ) , the log2 ( FPKM ) distribution shows a primary peak of high expression genes , with a long left shoulder of low-expression transcripts . Therefore , only transcripts with FPKM values higher than 1 were taken into account . In order to assess the specificity of the NEAT1 RNA pull-down we crossed the results obtain with the two oligonucleotides ( see Neat1 RNA pull-down ) to generate the list of transcripts associated to the paraspeckles . All the RNA sequencing data are available at Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) ( accession no . GSE81972 ) . GH4C1 cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-ornithine . After incubation in 30% normal blocking serum containing 0 . 2% Triton X-100 ( 30 min ) , coverslips were transferred to primary antibody or a mixture of primary antibodies ( overnight , 4°C ) and , after rinsing , to fluorescent secondary antibody or a mixture of fluorescent secondary antibodies ( 2 hr , 22°C ) . Nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye ( 1 µmol/ml , 5 min ) . All dilutions and rinsing between each step of the procedures were made in Tris buffer added with 1% normal serum . NONO , SFPQ , PSPC1 , RBM14 were detected using the respective polyclonal rabbit antibodies: ab45359 ( 1: 1000 ) Abcam , ab38148 ( 1: 1000 ) Abcam , HPA038904 ( 1: 1000 ) Sigma-Aldrich , ab70636 ( 1: 1000 ) Abcam . After mounting with PBS containing 50% glycerol , the reacted sections were kept in darkness at 4°C until examination . To detect Neat1 RNA , GH4C1 cells grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-ornithine were fixed in 3 . 6% formaldehyde . Hybridization was carried out using Custom Stellaris FISH Probes ( Biosearch Technologies , Novato , USA ) . Probes used are Neat1 probes labeled with Quasar 570 Dye or Neat1 probes labeled with Quasar 670 for STORM analysis . Nuclei of the cells were counterstained by Hoechst solution ( 5 ng/ml ) . The confocal image acquisition was performed on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope equipped with a 63X 1 . 4 N . A . oil immersion objective . Dyes used in either immunocytochemistry ( ICC ) or RNA-Fish were imaged using the appropriate wavelength for optimal dye excitation , i . e . 405 nm for Hoechst , 561 nm for Cy3 and Quasar 570 , and 633 nm for both Cy5 and Quasar 670 . The spectral detection of emitted fluorescence were set as follows: 420–480 nm for Hoechst , 560–670 nm for Cy3 or Quasar 570 and 640–750 nm for Cy5 or Quasar 670 . Three dimensional z-stacks were collected automatically as frame by frame sequential image series . To enhance resolution , the ICC images were deconvolved based on a theoretical point spread function ( PSF ) using AutoQuantX ( Media Cybernetics , Rockville , USA ) . Prior to observation , samples were mounted in imaging buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 20 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mg/ml glucose oxydase , 40 µg/ml catalase , 10% w/v glucose , 10 mM mercaptoethylamine ) . Imaging was performed with a Nikon Storm System ( N-Storm , Nikon France S . A , Champigny sur Marne , France ) equipped with a 100X 1 . 49 N . A . oil immersion objective . A reference conventional fluorescence image of the cell of interest was acquired before recording storm sequence of images . For super resolution image acquisition , the sample stained with Quasar 670 dye was excited by a 647 nm imaging laser . Illumination with 405 nm light was gradually increased along recording to reactivate Quasar 670 blinking . The fluorescence emission was separated from the excitation light by adapted dichroic mirror ( 660 nm ) and filters ( 692/4 nm ) and collected on an IXon EMCCD camera ( Andor Technology , Belfast , UK ) . Typically , dSTORM images were reconstructed from 40000 frames using NIS-software ( Nikon ) . For real-time monitoring of intracellular fluorescence circadian oscillations , 4 × 104 Alu-egfp or IRAlu-egfp GH4C1 cells were seeded on glass-bottom 24 well plates ( coated with poly- ornithine ) . The next day , the medium was changed with a growth medium containing 100 nM forskolin to synchronize the cellular circadian oscillators . 20 min later , the medium was changed again with a DMEM without phenol red medium containing 100 mM 4- ( 2-hydroxyethyl ) -1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid ( HEPES ) and 100 mM pyruvate . The next day , plates were transferred to an inverted microscope ( Axiovert-200 , Zeiss ) equipped with an environmental chamber , the temperature of which was set to 37°C and CO2 regulated to 5% . Egfp was excited through a 475/40 band-pass filter . An EMCCD camera ( Rolera EM-C2 , Q-Imaging ) was used to collect emitted fluorescence at 530/50 nm . Time-lapse recordings of multiple regions in each well were realized over 96 hr with 1 picture every 30 min ( Metamorph , Roper Scientific ) , using a 40X objective . The data were processed for tracking and measuring fluorescence fluctuations of individual cells with the CGE ( Circadian Gene Expression ) Plugging of ImageJ ( Sage et al . , 2010 ) . Cells retained for analysis fulfilled two criteria: they were detected for at least 48 hr and their mean fluorescent level was 10% higher than mean level of the background . After processing of the cells for FISH of Neat1 RNA , quantification of paraspeckle bodies was performed on confocal images using a 40X objective . At each time point analyzed , 20 to 35 fields acquired in four wells from two different experiments were counted to estimate the total paraspeckle number per well of 100000 cells and to estimate among cells which expressed paraspeckles the mean number per cell . Data from real time monitored cells or mean experimental values ( ± SEM ) expressed as a percent of initial value were fitted ( Prism4 software , GraphPad Software , Inc . ) by a non-linear sine wave equation to find the set of parameters that gives the least-squared distance between the data and the equation: y ( t ) = B + A*exp ( -t ) *sin ( 2*pi*t/T + P ) where B is the Baseline , A is the Amplitude , T is the period and P is the Phase-shift . Goodness-of-fit was quantified using R squared , experimental values being considered well fitted by cosinor regression when the R squared was higher than 0 . 55 . A statistically significant circadian oscillation was considered if the 95% confidence interval for the amplitude did not include the zero value ( zero-amplitude test ) ( Yang et al . , 2009 ) ( Kavcic et al . , 2011 ) . Significant differences between groups were determined using either ordinary one-way ANOVA or unpaired t test ( Prism4 software ) . Values were considered significantly different for p<0 . 05 ( * ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Discussion', 'Materials\xa0and\xa0methods']","['chromosomes and gene expression', 'cell biology']",elife-14837-v2,285,5713,5428,20.04561403508772

This DNA segment is organized in modules , with coding sections separated by portions of non-coding DNA known as introns . When a gene is ‘turned on’ , it gets faithfully copied into a molecule of pre-messenger RNA ( pre-mRNA ) , which contains the alternating coding and non-coding modules . Before it can serve as a template to create a protein , this pre-mRNA must be processed and all the introns removed by a structure called the spliceosome . If this delicate process goes wrong , inaccurate protein templates are produced that may be damaging for the cell . Spliceosomes are precise molecular ‘scissors’ that can recognize where a coding module stops and an intron starts , and then make a snip in the pre-mRNA to remove the non-coding sequence . The spliceosome is a complex molecular machine formed of numerous parts – including one known as U1 snRNP – that must come together . When a pre-mRNA has several introns , a spliceosome assembles anew for each of them . Braun et al . designed a new method that allows them to ‘tag’ spliceosomes extracted from a human cell and follow them as they come together . The experiments show that spliceosomes working on different introns in the same pre-mRNA actually help each other out . As one assembles , this helps the spliceosome that processes the neighboring intron to get built . In particular , the U1 snRNPs processing nearby introns collaborate to promote the assembly and activity of the spliceosomes . This teamwork is likely important to guarantee that multiple introns are cut out quickly and accurately .","Most human genes contain multiple introns , necessitating mechanisms to effectively define exons and ensure their proper connection by spliceosomes . Human spliceosome assembly involves both cross-intron and cross-exon interactions , but how these work together is unclear . We examined in human nuclear extracts dynamic interactions of single pre-mRNA molecules with individual fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes to investigate how cross-intron and cross-exon processes jointly promote pre-spliceosome assembly . U1 subcomplex bound to the 5' splice site of an intron acts jointly with U1 bound to the 5' splice site of the next intron to dramatically increase the rate and efficiency by which U2 subcomplex is recruited to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron . The flanking 5' splice sites have greater than additive effects implying distinct mechanisms facilitating U2 recruitment . This synergy of 5' splice sites across introns and exons is likely important in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs . 
 Spliceosomes consist of the U1 , U2 , and U4/U6 . U5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( snRNPs ) and multiprotein Prp19-complex as major building blocks , plus many transiently interacting splicing factors ( Wahl et al . , 2009 ) . This machinery recognizes and assembles stepwise at splice sites ( SS ) ( U1 at 5'SS and U2 at the 3'SS/branch site ) to form pre-spliceosomes , which are subsequently remodeled into catalytically active spliceosomes . Pre-spliceosomes can form on multi-intron pre-mRNAs through at least two different pathways . An intron can be recognized a ) via cross-intron interactions leading directly to a catalytically active spliceosome , or b ) via cross-exon interactions where the exons flanking an intron are first defined , after which cross-intron interactions between adjacent cross-exon complexes lead to spliceosome assembly ( Moldón and Query , 2010 ) . On human pre-mRNAs , which characteristically harbor multiple long introns and short exons , exon definition predominates ( Berget , 1995; Fox-Walsh et al . , 2005 ) . Indeed , splicing is greatly enhanced when a 5'SS is present across the exon downstream of an intron , highlighting the importance of exon definition in humans ( Talerico and Berget , 1990; Yue and Akusjärvi , 1999 ) . Cross-exon pre-spliceosomes can transition into cross-intron pre-spliceosomes , each having a distinct protein composition; the latter can then productively splice the pre-mRNA ( Chiara and Reed , 1995; Schneider et al . , 2010 ) . However , the mechanisms by which cross-intron and cross-exon pre-spliceosomes work together to facilitate pre-mRNA splicing remain unclear . In S . cerevisiae , where the cross-intron pathway predominates , single-molecule approaches have proven invaluable for elucidating the kinetic pathways and subcomplex dynamics involved in spliceosome assembly ( Semlow et al . , 2016; Warnasooriya and Rueda , 2014 ) . Here we developed the tools necessary to implement colocalization single-molecule spectroscopy ( CoSMoS ) in human cell extracts and used this system to investigate the dynamic mechanism of cross-intron and cross-exon cooperation in human pre-spliceosome assembly . 
 We began by investigating whether human nuclear extracts can assemble catalytically-competent spliceosomes on surface-tethered pre-mRNA molecules . To do this , we utilized the pre-mRNA model substrate PIP85A ( Moore and Sharp , 1992 ) ( Figure 1A , Table 1 ) . We refer to this RNA here as ‘5i3’ to indicate that , reading in the 5'-to-3' direction , it contains a partial exon , a 5'SS ( ‘5’ ) , an intron ( i ) , a 3'SS ( ‘3’ ) , and another partial exon . For this pre-mRNA 20 ± 2% ( s . d . ) was converted to spliced products after 40 mins in human cell line HEK293 nuclear extract ( Figure 1B ) . No spliced products were observed in the absence of ATP , which is required for spliceosome assembly . To monitor splicing of individual 5i3 molecules , we incorporated a green-excited dye into the 5' exon , a red-excited dye into the intron , and biotin at the end of the 3' exon ( Figure 1C ) . We sparsely deposited this pre-mRNA onto a streptavidin-functionalized glass surface , added nuclear extract and followed green and red fluorescence from single pre-mRNA molecules over time . To exclude pre-mRNAs that lost intron signal due to RNA degradation , we selected only those molecules retaining 5' exon ( green ) fluorescence at the end of the 40 min experiment . Of these , 1 . 1 ± 0 . 7% ( s . e . ) lost intron ( red ) fluorescence in a control conducted in the absence of ATP ( likely due to photobleaching ) whereas 18 ± 4% ( s . e . ) lost intron fluorescence in the presence of ATP . This single-molecule assay specifically monitors intron release , while the bulk assay measures the second splicing step . Intron release requires an ATP-dependent structural rearrangement of the splicing machinery after the second splicing step , so as expected the lag phase was somewhat longer in the single-molecule assay ( Figure 1C ) than in the bulk splicing assay ( Figure 1B ) . However , surface-tethered 5i3 pre-mRNA molecules were spliced with a similar efficiency ( 17% ) to what is observed in solution ( 20% ) . To enable single-molecule visualization of individual spliceosomal subcomplexes , we generated three HEK293 cell lines , each stably expressing C-terminally fSNAP-tagged U1-70K , U2B’ , or Snu114 at a level comparable to the endogenous protein ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed efficient incorporation of the tagged protein into U1 , U2 , or U5 respectively ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Treatment of nuclear extracts with a green-excited dye-benzylguanine conjugate resulted in highly specific labeling of the fSNAP-tagged proteins ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . Because spliceosomal subcomplex concentrations in human nuclear extracts exceed the low dye concentrations optimal for single-molecule fluorescence , we labeled the tagged proteins using a limiting dye concentration ( 200 nM ) . Under these conditions , 30% , 60% , and 50% of total ( tagged plus untagged ) U1-70K , U2B’ , and Snu114 were labeled , respectively ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . Importantly , all tagged and dye-labeled extracts exhibited bulk splicing efficiencies comparable to extracts from the untagged parental cell line ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ) . We next used the labeled extracts in CoSMoS experiments in which we compared subcomplex dynamics on individual RNAs designed to promote assembly of cross-intron or cross-exon pre-spliceosomes ( Figure 2A ) . The cross-intron RNA ( 5i3 , Figure 2B ) was identical to that in Figure 1 except that it contained a single red-excited dye adjacent to the biotin tether at the end of the 3' exon . An identically-labeled cross-exon RNA ( 3e5 , Figure 2B ) was constructed by swapping the 5' and 3' halves of 5i3 . Thus , 5i3 and 3e5 consist of identical sequence segments , and differ only by whether the 5' and 3'SS are separated by an intron ( i ) or an exon ( e ) . Simultaneous presence of the two RNA species at distinct , known locations on the slide surface allowed us to compare their behavior under identical experimental conditions within a single reaction chamber ( Figure 2C ) . After introducing extract containing dye-labeled U1 , we monitored the binding and dissociation of labeled U1 to individual RNA molecules and to control locations that had no RNA ( e . g . , Figure 2D ) . Similar experiments were performed using U2- and U5-labeled extracts . To quantitatively characterize subcomplex binding to the surface tethered RNAs , we measured both the frequency of RNA-specific subcomplex binding events and the steady-state fractional occupancy RNA molecules by the subcomplex . U1 binding to 5i3 RNA was highly dynamic with many arrivals and departures per active RNA molecule ( Figure 2E–G ) and a high frequency of short ( <50 s ) binding events ( Figure 2F and H ) . In comparison , progressively fewer 5i3 molecules bound U2 and U5 and the average occupancy of RNAs by these subcomplexes was also progressively lower ( Figure 2F and I ) . Observed binding events were almost entirely RNA-specific; fewer and only short-duration binding events were observed at control ‘no RNA’ locations ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . Overall , the kinetics of human spliceosomal subcomplex binding and dissociation on the cross-intron 5i3 substrate were similar to those observed in CoSMoS experiments on cross-intron RNAs in S . cerevisiae extracts ( Hoskins et al . , 2011; Shcherbakova et al . , 2013 ) . Spliceosomal subcomplex interactions with the cross-exon 3e5 RNA were quantitatively different from interactions with the cross-intron 5i3 RNA . 3e5 RNA molecules exhibited more frequent binding events ( Figure 2F and G ) and higher mean occupancy ( Figure 2I ) for all subcomplexes than 5i3 molecules . These differences might be partially explained by the inability of the cross-exon pre-mRNA to form a catalytically active spliceosome ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) , resulting in the greater accumulation of inactive spliceosome assembly intermediates at steady state . Consistent with this idea , U1 , U2 and U5 exhibited a higher frequency of long-lived ( >50 s ) binding events on the splicing-inactive 3e5 RNA than on the spliceable cross-intron 5i3 RNA ( Figure 2H ) . In addition , possible differences between 5i3 and 3e5 three-dimensional structures could also alter the kinetics of their interactions with snRNPs . We next investigated the effects of SS consensus sequence mutations on U1 and U2 binding dynamics . We restricted alterations to short consensus subcomplex binding sequences to reduce the possibility of the mutations causing large-scale changes in the three-dimensional structures of the RNAs . Functional U2 association with pre-mRNA depends on a polypyrimidine tract and the 3'SS AG ( Ruskin et al . , 1988 ) . As expected , multiple pyrimidine to purine substitutions within the polypyrimidine tract combined with a 3'SS AG to GG mutation ( Figure 3A ) greatly decreased the frequencies of RNA-specific U2 binding events , reducing binding to near-background levels ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . U1 binding , however , was largely unaffected by these mutations , with U1 specific association frequencies and dwell time distributions on 5iX and Xe5 RNAs indistinguishable from those on 5i3 and 3e5 , respectively ( Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Thus , consistent with previous cross-intron data in yeast ( Séraphin and Rosbash , 1991 ) , human U1 binding is independent of U2 binding in both cross-intron and cross-exon contexts . Functional U1 association is blocked by mutation of the 5'SS consensus from AG/GU to CCCC ( Roca et al . , 2013 ) . As expected , this mutation ( Figure 3C ) decreased the U1 association rate and eliminated RNA-specific long-duration ( >60 s ) U1 binding events in both cross-intron and cross-exon contexts ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . Thus long-duration U1 binding events reflect its association with the canonical 5'SS , as reported previously in S . cerevisiae extract ( Larson and Hoskins , 2017 ) . In contrast , short duration U1 binding events are still present ( although reduced in frequency ) after 5'SS mutation and may reflect sequence non-specific interactions with the RNA . Surprisingly , the 5'SS mutations affected U2 binding even more strongly than U1 binding . In both the cross-intron and cross-exon contexts , elimination of the canonical 5'SS decreased U2 binding frequency to background within experimental uncertainty ( Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ) . Absence of U5 binding to these RNAs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 5 ) confirmed that the mutations abolished the formation of functional pre-spliceosomes . These observations could indicate that observable U2 binding requires the U1 binding to a 5'SS positioned either cross-exon or cross-intron . Alternatively the results could also be explained if the 5'SS mutation indirectly affects U2 binding by affecting the pre-mRNA secondary structure . To exclude the latter possibility , we demonstrated U2 binding to the 5i3 and 3e5 was also eliminated in experiments ( Figure 3—figure supplement 6 ) in which U1 interaction with the 5'SS was blocked by the addition of a morpholino oligonucleotide antisense to the U1 snRNA ( Kaida et al . , 2010 ) . We conclude that U2 binding to the 3'SS is strongly dependent on U1 binding to a 5'SS either upstream ( cross-intron ) or downstream ( cross-exon ) . This suggests an ordered human pre-spliceosome assembly pathway in which stable U2 association in the presence of ATP requires prior U1 binding , in contrast to the branched pathway observed in S . cerevisiae ( Shcherbakova et al . , 2013 ) . In multi-intron pre-mRNAs , internal exons have 5'SS both upstream and downstream , either or both of which could bind U1 and act to recruit U2 to the 3'SS . In principle , the two U1s could act either independently or synergistically . If there is only one means by which U1 can recruit U2 ( e . g . , via binding to a single site on U2 ) , the combined effect of two U1s on U2 binding would be at most the sum of their individual actions ( Herschlag and Johnson , 1993 ) . Such is the case for the activities of multiple SR proteins on splicing efficiency ( Graveley et al . , 1998 ) . In contrast , if the upstream and downstream U1s can interact with U2 simultaneously , or if they accelerate different steps in the overall U2 recruitment process , their combined effect could be larger , that is , synergistic . Such synergy was previously observed between two distinct sequence elements within a regulated splicing enhancer ( Lynch and Maniatis , 1995 ) . To determine whether the upstream and downstream 5'SS independently or synergistically promote U2 binding , we constructed a pre-mRNA with 5'SS both upstream and downstream of the 3'SS ( 5i3e5 , Figure 4A ) as well as RNAs with mutations in either one 5'SS ( Xi3e5 and 5i3eX ) or both ( Xi3eX ) . In these constructs , the sequences flanking both 5'SS were identical , minimizing potential sequence context effects . Consistent with the concept of exon definition ( Talerico and Berget , 1990 ) , splicing of 5i3e5 was 5-fold more efficient than 5i3eX in ensemble splicing reactions ( Figure 4B ) . In fact , the effect of adding the downstream 5'SS was strong enough to activate an otherwise dormant cryptic 5'SS in the Xi3e5 construct . As expected , no splicing was observed on Xi3eX RNA . We next performed single-molecule observations of U2 binding to these same four RNAs , all tethered and observed in a single reaction chamber to facilitate their direct comparison . Consistent with the observation that U2 binding in the cross-intron and cross-exon contexts depends on a 5'SS ( Figure 3C and D ) , no U2 binding above background levels was observed for the RNA with no 5'SS ( Xi3eX ) ( Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Additionally , the shapes of the U2 dwell time distributions on 5i3eX and Xi3e5 ( Figure 4C ) were similar to those of the shorter 5i3 cross-intron and 3e5 cross-exon constructs ( Figure 2F ) . Thus , the 5'SS dependence of U2 binding seen with the longer RNAs was qualitatively similar to that observed on the previously characterized shorter RNAs . Striking differences were apparent , however , when we compared the single 5'SS RNAs ( Xi3e5 and 5i3eX ) to the double 5'SS RNA ( 5i3e5 ) ( Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . The presence of flanking 5'SS both upstream and downstream of the 3'SS dramatically increased U2 recruitment , with the RNA-specific U2 binding event frequency being more than 2 . 5 times the sum of the frequencies observed when either the upstream or downstream 5'SS was present alone . A similar effect was seen in the U2 occupancy measurements ( Figure 4C ) , although the occupancy data is more difficult to interpret due to splicing via the cryptic splice site in Xi3e5 . A much greater than additive effect was also seen when we compared the distributions of the time to the first U2 binding observed on each RNA ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) , a metric that is comparatively immune to artefacts from spot detection dropouts ( Friedman and Gelles , 2015 ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the upstream and downstream 5'SS act synergistically to accelerate the rate of stable U2 recruitment to the 3'SS . 
 Here we establish methods for observing the dynamics of spliceosomal subcomplexes on and the splicing of individual pre-mRNA molecules in human cell extract . The experiments reveal that the dynamics of U1 binding to the 5'SS are largely unaffected by the presence of U2 binding sites positioned either downstream ( cross-exon ) or upstream ( cross-intron ) of the 5'SS . In contrast , stable U2 binding to the 3'SS is accelerated by a 5'SS situated across either the adjacent intron or adjacent exon . Strikingly , when functional 5'SS are present together at both cross-intron and cross-exon locations , they synergistically promote U2 recruitment . The more than additive effect of the flanking 5'SS indicates that U1 employs different molecular mechanisms/interactions across introns and across exons to accelerate U2 recruitment . A simple model that would explain this observed synergy of cross-exon and cross-intron 5'SS on U2 recruitment rate is that cross-exon U1 binding assists in recruiting the splicing factors that form a platform for U2 binding to the upstream 3'SS region , whereas the cross-intron U1-U2 interaction favors a U2 conformation capable of productive branch site engagement ( Figure 5 , left ) . Across exons , U1 is known to recruit U2AF ( U2 auxiliary factor ) , which recognizes the polypyrimidine tract and 3'SS AG , and physically interacts with other proteins ( e . g . , SF1 , p14 , SF3B and SR proteins ) required for stable U2 binding ( Black , 2003 ) . Across introns , U1 and U2 can interact via the DEAD-box protein Prp5 , the ATPase activity of which promotes a structural change in U2 that makes the branch site recognition sequence more solvent accessible ( Abu Dayyeh et al . , 2002; O'Day et al . , 1996; Xu et al . , 2004 ) . A different and not necessarily mutually exclusive model is that cross-exon and cross-intron U1 interactions could both help form the binding platform for U2 , but by interacting with different proteins ( e . g . , the upstream U1 stabilizes SF1 and the downstream U1 stabilizes U2AF ) ( Black , 2003 ) . This arrangement would increase the likelihood of U2 encountering a fully assembled binding platform when in a conformation capable of stable branch site engagement ( Figure 5 , right ) . Other mechanisms for synergy , such as those mediated by effects on RNA secondary structure , are also possible . Models of the type presented in Figure 5 assume that once a functional U1-U2 pre-spliceosome forms across the intron , interactions with U1 bound to the downstream 5'SS provide no additional U2 binding stabilization or stimulation of subsequent steps of spliceosome assembly ( Figure 5 , bottom ) . Such models predict that the presence of a downstream U1 will not affect the lifetimes of stable U2 complexes once formed . The data in Figure 4C are consistent with this prediction: both the overall shape of dwell time distributions and the ratios of binding frequency to occupancy are similar for the RNAs with ( 5i3e5: 1 . 0 ± 0 . 2 s−1 ) or without ( 5i3eX: 1 . 3 ± 0 . 9 s−1 ) the downstream site . Taken together , our data suggest that the synergistic stimulatory effect of the downstream 5'SS on splicing is exerted at the U2 recruitment step and the processes that enable it , not at the subsequent steps of spliceosome assembly and splicing . Inappropriate skipping of otherwise constitutive internal exons can occur with exceptionally low frequency ( ~1 in 105 splicing events ) ( Fox-Walsh and Hertel , 2009 ) . But the molecular mechanisms contributing to this remarkable accuracy were previously unclear . By implementing CoSMoS in extracts from human cells expressing genetically-tagged proteins , we here show that a major contributor to exon inclusion is collaboration between flanking 5'SS . This collaboration dramatically increases the rate of stable U2 recruitment during pre-spliceosome formation . Cross-intron and cross-exon 5'SS synergy on U2 recruitment rate explains how U1 can have such a strong effect on U2 recruitment despite its association with pre-mRNA being much more dynamic than U2 . This mechanism is likely crucial for rapid definition of internal exons in multi-intron RNAs , enabling the human splicing machinery to avoid inappropriate exon skipping . 
 Stable HEK293 Tet-On Flp-In cell lines were generated to express fSNAP fusions of U1-70K , U2B'' , and Snu114 at near endogenous levels as previously described ( Singh et al . , 2012 ) . Stable HEK293 Tet-On Flp-In cell lines were generated from the Flp-In T-REx−293 Cell Line ( Invitrogen , R78007 ) . The cells were purchased from Invitrogen and their resistance to Zeocin and their Flp-In competence were confirmed . No further authentication or mycoplasma contamination testing were performed . Plasmid pcDNA5-FRT-TetO-fSNAPc was generated by amplifying the open reading frame of fSNAP using PCR primers fSNAP-F and fSNAP-R ( Table 2 ) and inserting into pcDNA5-FRT-TetO ( Invitrogen ) using the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites . Plasmids containing spliceosomal subcomplex protein-fSNAP fusions ( Table 3 ) were generated by PCR amplification from HEK293 cDNA for U1-70K and U2B'' , and from Kazusa DNA Research Institute cDNA clone ORK00375 ( Nomura et al . , 1994 ) for Snu114 using the specified primers ( Table 2 ) and cloning the products into pcDNA5-TetO-fSNAPc using the KpnI and NotI restriction sites . Expression levels of the fSNAP fusion proteins were adjusted to endogenous level by inducing the U1-70K-fSNAP , U2B''-fSNAP , and Snu114-fSNAP Flp-In cell lines with 6 ng/ml , 3 ng/ml , and 3 ng/ml Doxycycline ( BD Biosciences , 631311 ) , respectively . Parental cells were not induced . Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described ( Lee et al . , 1988 ) . In brief , HEK293 cells were grown at 37°C 5% CO2 in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS . Cells from 10 confluent 15 cm dishes were harvested and washed with ice cold PBS . Cells ( 900 µl ) were resuspended in 900 µl Buffer A [10 mM Tris , 1 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 10 mM KCl and 0 . 5 mM DTT , pH 7 . 9 at 4°C , supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , 04693159001 ) ] , transferred to a 2 ml Eppendorf tube , incubated for on ice 15 min and then disrupted by 10 passages through a 25 gauge needle . After centrifuging the lysate for 20 s at 12 , 000 × g , the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 450 µl Buffer C [20 mM Tris , 25% ( v/v ) glycerol , 0 . 42 M NaCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 2 mM EDTA and 0 . 5 mM DTT , pH 7 . 9 at 4°C , supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , 04693159001 ) ] and rapidly stirred in a 2 ml round-bottom microcentrifuge tube with a 12 . 7 × 3 mm stir bar for 30 min . After clarifying the lysate by centrifuging for 10 min at 12 , 000 × g , the SNAP-Surface 549 dye-benzylguanine conjugate ( New England BioLabs , S9112S ) was added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 200 nM and incubated for 30 min at 30°C . After labeling , the supernatant was dialyzed 2 times for 2 hr each against Buffer E ( 20 mM Tris , 20% ( v/v ) glycerol , 0 . 1 M KCl , 0 . 2 mM EDTA and 0 . 5 mM DTT , pH 7 . 9 at 4°C ) . The dialysate ( 1 ml ) was spun again for 10 min at 16 , 000 × g and frozen in liquid nitrogen . Typical total protein concentration was 8 . 5 mg/ml . For negative control experiments , extracts were depleted of ATP using Centri-sep spin columns ( Princeton Separations , CS-901 ) ( Anderson and Moore , 2000 ) . A single preparation of each of the three extracts was used in all reported experiments . Radioactively labeled pre-mRNA substrate PIP85A ( Table 1 ) was synthesized by in vitro transcription as previously described with a m7G ( 5' ) ppp ( 5' ) G 5' cap and [α-32P]UTP ( Moore and Sharp , 1992 ) . Two color pre-mRNAs carrying a 3' biotin ( Figure 1C ) were prepared by splinted ligation as previously described ( Crawford et al . , 2013; Shcherbakova et al . , 2013 ) using DNA oligonucleotides and RNA segments listed in Tables 1 and 2 . Specifically , RNA segments S1 ( with a m7G ( 5' ) ppp ( 5' ) G 5' cap ) and S4 were produced in vitro by transcription by T7 RNA polymerase of templates generated by PCR from the plasmid PIP85A using the PCR primers S1-T7-F and S1-R or S4-T7-F and S4-R respectively . S2 and S3 were purchased from Dharmacon . Prior to the ligation 5' ends of S2 , S3 and S4 were phosphorylated and S3 was labeled with AlexaFluor 647 NHS ester ( Thermo Scientific , A20006 ) as previously described ( Crawford et al . , 2013; Shcherbakova et al . , 2013 ) . For the final splinted ligation S1 , S2 , S3 , S4 RNA segments and the ligation splint oligonucleotide were annealed . The ligation resulted in an RNA where the 5' exon was labeled with a single green-excited dye ( DY547 ) at position −7 relative to the 5'SS , the intron was labeled with on average two red-excited dyes ( AlexaFluor 647 ) at positions 18 , 30 and/or 42 relative to the 5'SS , and a single biotin was added to the 3' end by Klenow extension with biotin-dCTP ( Trilink Bio Technologies Inc , N5002 ) ( Braun and Serebrov , 2017; Shcherbakova et al . , 2013 ) . One-color pre-mRNAs ( Figures 2 , 3 and 4 ) were labeled at the 3' end by Klenow extension with both AlexaFluor 647 dUTP ( Life Technologies , A32763 ) and biotin dCTP , resulting in one ( 5i3 and 3e5 ) or two ( 5i3e5 ) AlexaFluor 647 dyes and one biotin per pre-mRNA molecule . All oligonucleotides used for Klenow extensions are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0 . 45 μm pore size nitrocellulose membrane ( Whatman , PROTRAN BA 85 , 10 401 196 ) . Proteins were detected using the indicated antibodies and an Odyssey CLx Imager ( LI-COR ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . Cells ( one 15 cm dish per condition ) were lysed in 3 ml Buffer 1 ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM MgCl2 ) supplemented with 40 μg/ml digitonin . Nuclei were collected by pelleting at 2 , 000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 3 ml Buffer 1 supplemented with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 and complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche , 04693159001 ) . The suspension was sonicated ( Branson Digital Sonifier-250 ) for 8 s in bursts of 2 s and the NaCl concentration adjusted to 150 mM . This nuclear lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15 , 000 × g for 10 min and an input sample taken . Dynabeads Protein A ( Life Technologies , 10002D ) or Protein G ( Life Technologies , 10001D ) pre-incubated with respective antibodies were added and nutated for 2 hr . After four washes with Buffer 2 ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1% NP-40 ) , bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading dye and analyzed by Western blotting as described above . Protein samples were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS-PAGE ) . Gels were fixed in 25% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid , and fluorescence was imaged using a Typhoon scanner ( GE Healthcare ) . Gels were subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye R-250 ( Thermo Scientific , 20278 ) to visualize total protein . Splicing reactions were performed at 30°C in 20 µl of 40% HEK 293 nuclear extract in final concentrations of 60 mM K+-MOPS pH 7 . 3 , 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 2 mM MgOAc2 , 20 mM potassium glutamate , 5 mM creatine phosphate , and 0 . 1 mg/ml E . coli tRNA with 20 fmol radioactively labeled pre-mRNA substrate . To make conditions correspond to those in the CoSMoS experiments , the bulk assays also included 0 . 9 U/ml B . cepacia protocatechuate dioxygenase ( Sigma P8279; 5 U/mg; 9 mg/ml ) and 5 mM protocatechuate ( Sigma 37580 , recrystallized from hot water before use ) as an O2 scavenging system and 1 mM Trolox ( 6-hydroxy-2 , 5 , 7 , 8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid , Aldrich , 23 , 881–3 ) as a triplet quencher ( Hoskins et al . , 2011 ) . Where indicated , anti-U1 AMO or control AMO ( Gene Tools , sequences are described in Table 2 ) were added at 10 µM final concentration as previously described ( Kaida et al . , 2010 ) and the splicing reaction was 20 min pre-incubated at 30°C prior to the addition of pre-mRNA substrate . After incubating at 30°C for times indicated , splicing reactions were stopped by adding 10 volumes of Stop Buffer ( 100 mM Tris-Cl- , 10 mM EDTA , 1% SDS , 150 mM NaCl , and 300 mM sodium acetate , pH 7 . 5 ) . RNAs were extracted and separated by denaturing polyacrylamide ( 15% ) gel electrophoresis . The dried gel was phosphorimaged with a Typhoon PhosphorImager and RNAs quantified using ImageQuant with signal intensities being normalized to their U content . Splicing efficiencies were calculated as the ratio of spliced RNA product ( i . e . , ligated exons ) to pre-mRNA starting material at time zero . Glass slides and cover slips were prepared as described previously ( Friedman et al . , 2006 ) except that PEGylation was only allowed to proceed for 3 hr at room temperature after which slides and coverslips were washed with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 , dried with N2 gas and stored at −80°C until use . After assembly of reaction chambers with vacuum grease ( up to five lanes per slide with a volume of ~25 µl each ) , individual lanes were rehydrated immediately before use with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 . Single-molecule fluorescence imaging used a micro-mirror total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscope with automatic focus ( Friedman et al . , 2006; Hoskins et al . , 2011 ) . Sample temperature was maintained at 30°C using a custom-built temperature control system ( Paramanathan et al . , 2014 ) . Streptavidin-conjugated fluorescent beads ( Life Technologies , T10711 ) were tethered to the surface ( multiple beads per field of view ) and were used as reference for stage drift correction . RNAs were tethered on the slide surface at a total density of ~0 . 2–0 . 5 fluorescent spots per µm2 . When multiple different RNA species were tethered sequentially , a microscope image was taken after each round of deposition to individually identify the molecules of each RNA species . Splicing reactions ( 60 µl ) were assembled as described for the bulk assays above ( but without pre-mRNA ) and introduced into individual slide lanes by capillary action and wicking; imaging was initiated immediately after reaction loading . For experiments with the two color pre-mRNA we acquired a 1 s duration frame every 5 min with 150 μW 633 nm ( red ) excitation except at the beginning and end of the experiment when we acquired one frame per second with 300 μW 532 nm ( green ) excitation . For experiments with the one color pre-mRNAs and labeled nuclear extracts we acquired sequences of 100 one-second duration frames with 300 μW 532 nm excitation alternating with a single one-second frame with 150 μW 633 nm excitation . All excitation powers are measured incident to the input micro-mirror . Data analysis was performed using custom software ( https://github . com/gelles-brandeis/CoSMoS_Analysis; copy archived at https://github . com/elifesciences-publications/CoSMoS_Analysis ) implemented in MATLAB ( MathWorks ) as previously described ( Friedman and Gelles , 2015; Hoskins et al . , 2011 ) ; locations of fluorescent spots were identified by image analysis using the spot-picker algorithm ( Friedman and Gelles , 2015 ) . Locations of tethered RNA molecules and control locations were determined in drift-corrected , color-aligned images . For spliceosomal subcomplex detection , images were averaged with a five frame sliding window before spot picking . Binding frequencies were calculated as described ( Friedman and Gelles , 2015 ) . The provided source data files are ‘intervals’ files readable by imscroll ( https://github . com/gelles-brandeis/CoSMoS_Analysis ) . The time-averaged specific occupancy of RNA molecules by a spliceosomal subcomplex ( i . e . , the fraction of time the RNA a fluorescently labeled subcomplex is bound to the RNA ) was calculated as ( fm - fc ) / ( 1 - fc ) where the subscripts m and c refer to RNA and no RNA control locations , respectively , and f represents the fraction of time that a fluorescent spot was present , averaged over all locations measured for each type . Note that this value underestimates the subcomplex occupancy since only a fraction of each subcomplex is labeled ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . Standard error of the fractional occupancy was determined by bootstrapping ( 2 , 000 random samples ) . Distributions of time to first binding event were fit to background-corrected single-exponential models as described ( Friedman and Gelles , 2015 ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['biochemistry and chemical biology', 'structural biology and molecular biophysics']",elife-37751-v2,288,5869,5581,20.37847222222222

However , in an uncertain situation , this decision process requires balancing two competing priorities: exploiting options that are expected to be rewarding ( exploitation ) , and exploring alternatives that could be more valuable ( exploration ) . Decision making and exploration are disrupted in many mental disorders , some of which can differ in either presentation or risk of development across women and men . This raises the question of whether sex differences in exploration and exploitation could contribute to the vulnerability to these conditions . To shed light on this question , Chen et al . studied exploration in male and female mice as they played a video game . The mice had the option to touch one of two locations on a screen for a chance to win a small reward . The likelihood of success was different between the two options , and so the mice were incentivized to determine which was the more rewarding button . While the mice were similarly successful in finding rewards regardless of sex , on average male mice were more likely to keep exploring between the options while female mice more quickly gained confidence in an option . These differences were stronger during uncertain periods of learning and exploration than when making choices in a well-known situation , indicating that periods of uncertainty are when the influence of sex on cognition are most visible . However , not every female or male mouse was the same – there was as much variability within a sex as was seen between sexes . These results indicate that sex mechanisms , along with many other influences cause individual differences in the cognitive processes important for decision making . The approach used by Chen et al . could help to study individual differences in cognition in other species , and shed light on how individual differences in decision-making processes could contribute to risk and resilience to mental disorders .","Sex-based modulation of cognitive processes could set the stage for individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders . While value-based decision making processes in particular have been proposed to be influenced by sex differences , the overall correct performance in decision making tasks often show variable or minimal differences across sexes . Computational tools allow us to uncover latent variables that define different decision making approaches , even in animals with similar correct performance . Here , we quantify sex differences in mice in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision making task: a restless two-armed bandit . While male and female mice had similar accuracy , they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration . Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall , largely because they appeared to get ‘stuck’ in exploration once they had started . Female mice tended to explore less but learned more quickly during exploration . Together , these results suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices . Exploration during decision making is altered in people diagnosed with addictions , depression , and neurodevelopmental disabilities , pinpointing the neural mechanisms of exploration as a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses . 
 Almost every neuropsychiatric condition shows sex and/or gender biases in risk , presentation , etiology , and prognosis ( Green et al . , 2019; Grissom and Reyes , 2019; Shansky , 2019 ) . This raises the possibility that sex-modulated biological mechanisms could modulate cognitive processes that confer vulnerability and/or resilience to mental health challenges . However , sex differences in cognitive task performance can be difficult to detect and even more variable than would be expected given the non-dichotomous , overlapping impacts of sex mechanisms on cognition ( Maney , 2016 ) . An underrecognized source of variability in cognitive tasks is that there can be multiple ways to achieve the same level of performance on the primary dependent variables used to assess these tasks , such as ‘number of correct responses’ . This means that equivalent levels of performance could mask individual differences in how males and females are solving the same problem . Indeed , we have recently shown that examining the latent strategies underlying task performance --rather than differences in final performance--can reveal that individual males and females can take very different strategic paths to the learning of action-outcome associations ( Chen et al . , 2021b ) . Here , we applied computational tools to characterize sex differences in the latent variables underlying behavior to understand sex differences in a key cognitive process regulating reward-guided behaviors: balancing exploration and exploitation . In an uncertain world , we must balance two goals: exploiting rewarding options when they are available , but also exploring alternatives that could be more rewarding or provide new information about the world . Too little exploration makes behavior inflexible and perseverative . Too much makes it impossible to sustain rewarding behaviors . Exploration is dysregulated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders ( Addicott et al . , 2017; Wilson et al . , 2021 ) , many of which are also sex-biased ( Green et al . , 2019; Grissom and Reyes , 2019; Shansky , 2019 ) . This suggests that sex differences in exploration and exploitation could contribute to sex-linked vulnerability to these conditions , though we do not yet understand how exploration and exploitation differ with sex . Because exploration is a major source of errors in task performance more broadly ( Ebitz et al . , 2019; Pisupati et al . , 2019 ) , sex-differences in exploration could contribute to performance differences and variability seen across tasks and speciess ( Grissom and Reyes , 2019; van den Bos et al . , 2013 ) . To examine whether there are sex differences in exploration , we trained male and female mice on a classic explore/exploit task , a spatial restless two-armed bandit ( Ebitz et al . , 2018 ) . Males showed higher levels of exploration than females throughout the task . This was because males were more likely to get ‘stuck’ in extended periods of exploration before committing to a favored choice . On the other hand , females showed elevated reward learning specifically during bouts of exploration , making exploratory trials more informative , which allowed them to start exploiting a favored choice earlier than males . Together , these results demonstrate that while the overall performance was similar , males and females exhibited different patterns of exploration while interacting with the same uncertain environment . 
 Despite similar performance , response time differences suggested that males and females employed different strategies in this task . One possible difference was sex differences in the level of exploration . Prior research has shown that exploratory choices take longer than exploitative choices ( Ebitz et al . , 2019; Ebitz et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , perhaps males took longer to make a choice because a greater proportion of their choices were exploratory . To test this hypothesis , we first need a method to label each choice as an exploratory choice or an exploitative choice . In some previous studies , reinforcement learning ( RL ) models were used to quantify exploration ( Cinotti et al . , 2019; Daw et al . , 2006; Ishii et al . , 2002; Pearson et al . , 2009 ) via labeling choices that deviate from model values as exploratory . This approach is based on the rationale that exploration is a non-reward maximizing goal . However , a non-reward maximizing goal would produce choices that are orthogonal to reward value , not errors of reward maximization ( Averbeck et al . , 2017; Ebitz et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , recent studies have turned to an approach , which models exploration as a latent state underlying behavior via a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) , rather than inferring it from assumptions about values and learning ( Ebitz et al . , 2019; Ebitz et al . , 2018; Muller et al . , 2019 ) . The HMM method has not previously been used to quantify exploration in mice , so we first asked whether it was appropriate here . The method works because sequences of exploratory decisions look very different from exploitative ones , at least in reinforcement learning agents and primates ( Ebitz et al . , 2018 ) . When agents exploit , they repeatedly sample the same option , switching only very rarely . However , because exploration requires investigatory samples , runs of exploratory choices tend not to repeat the same option . They tend to switch far more frequently , closer to what we would expect from random samples from the environment ( Ebitz et al . , 2018 ) . Therefore , if mice were alternating between exploration and exploitation in this task , we would expect to see evidence of two distinct patterns of switching in their behavior . Indeed , choice run durations ( i . e . the distribution of inter-switch intervals ) were parsimoniously described as a mixture of two different patterns: one regime where choices switched quickly ( mean switching time = 1 . 7 trials , compared to random choices at two trials; 80 % of choice runs ) and one regime where they changed slowly ( mean switching time = 6 . 8 trials; Figure 1—figure supplement 2A ) . Thus , mice had evidence of fast-switching ( putatively explore ) and slow-switching ( putatively exploit ) regimes in their behavior . Note that explore-labeled choices are more likely to also be switch choices , but not all explore-labeled choices are switches , and not all exploit-labeled choices are stay decisions . To determine whether the novel HMM method produced more accurate labels than the previous RL method , we conducted a side-by-side comparison to examine how well each set of labels accounted for behavior . We first examined the correlation between explore-exploit states inferred by the HMM model and the RL model . We calculated the tetrachoric correlation between HMM-inferred and RL-inferred states ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) . The tetrachoric correlation ( rtet ) is specifically used to measure rater agreement for binary data and reveals how strong the association is between labels by two methods . The mean correlation was 0 . 42 with a standard deviation of 0 . 14 , which is medium level agreement . Next , to examine whether the states inferred by these models also produced differences in behavioral metrics other than choices , we computed average response time for explore trials and exploit trials labeled by the RL model and HMM model . The result suggested that response time was significantly longer during HMM-inferred exploration than exploitation ( paired t-test , t ( 31 ) = 3 . 66 , p = 0 . 0009 ) , which is consistent with previous findings that exploration slows down decision making ( Ebitz et al . , 2018 ) . Like HMM-inferred states , RL inferred explore-exploit states showed similar effects on response time - response time was significantly longer during exploration than exploitation ( paired t-test , t ( 31 ) = 2 . 08 , p = 0 . 046 ) . However , the effect size of HMM labels on response time was over twice as big as that of RL labels ( HMM: R2 = 0 . 30; RL: R2 = 0 . 12 ) . Finally , we calculated the standardized regression coefficients to measure how much of the response time is explained by states labeled by HMM model and RL model ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2C ) . The result suggested that the HMM-inferred states explained significantly more variance in response time than the RL-inferred states in explaining response time . The HMM allows us to make statistical inferences about the probability that each choice was due to exploration or exploitation via modeling these as the latent goal states underlying choice ( see Materials and methods ) . Because this approach to infer exploration is agnostic to the generative computations and depends only on the temporal statistics of choices ( Ebitz et al . , 2020; Ebitz et al . , 2019; Ebitz et al . , 2018; Wilson et al . , 2021 ) , it is particularly ideal for circumstances like this one , where we suspect that the generative computations may differ across groups . Since various factors could influence state of the next trial , we considered a simple two parameter HMM that models only two states ( exploration and exploitation ) , a four-parameter input-output HMM ( ioHMM ) that allows reward outcome to influence the probability of transitioning between states , and a four-parameter unrestricted HMM with no promoter tying ( ntHMM ) that allows biased exploitation ( see Materials and methods ) . The model comparisons have shown that the two parameter HMM was the simplest , most interpretable , and best fit model ( AIC: 2 parameter HMM , AIC = 2976 . 1; ioHMM , AIC = 3117; ntHMM , AIC = 3101 . 5 , see more statistics reported in Materials and methods ) . Therefore , we selected the simple two-parameter HMM to infer the likelihood that each choice was part of the exploratory regime , or the exploitative one ( see Materials and methods ) . To evaluate the face validity of the HMM labels , we asked whether HMM-labeled exploratory choices matched the normative definition of the term . First , by definition , exploration is a pattern of non-reward-maximizing choices whose purpose is learning about rewards . This means exploratory choices should be ( 1 ) orthogonal to reward value , and ( 2 ) exhibit enhanced reward learning . Explore-labeled choices were non-reward-maximizing: they were orthogonal to reward value ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D; the average value of choices chosen during exploration was not different from chance; one sample t-test , t ( 10 ) = 0 . 16 , p = 0 . 87 ) . Reward learning was also elevated during exploration . During HMM-labeled exploratory states , the outcome of choices had more influence on the subsequent decision - animals were more likely to stay with the same choice if rewarded and switch if not rewarded ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1F , two-way RM ANOVA , interaction term , F ( 1 , 31 ) = 51 . 2 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Differences in response time across HMM-inferred states suggested that these labels produced meaningful differences in primary behavioral metrics . To eliminate the possibility that exploration was merely disengagement from the task , we examined average reward retrieval time during exploratory and exploitative states . There was no significant difference in reward retrieval time between two states ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1G , t-test , t ( 31 ) = 0 . 05 , p = 0 . 95 ) , suggesting that animals were not more disengaged from the task during exploration than exploitation . They were only slower in making a decision . Together , these results demonstrated that HMM-labeled exploration was meaningful , non-reward-maximizing , and accompanied by enhanced reward learning , matching the normative definition of exploration . With more confidence in the validity of HMM-inferred states , we found that males , on average , were more likely to be in the exploratory regime than the exploitative one , with 72 . 9% ± 11 . 5% STD of trials labeled as exploratory ( Figure 1E ) . Females explored much less with only 55 . 4% ± 20 . 4% STD of trials being exploratory ( Figure 1F , t-test , t ( 30 ) = 2 . 98 , p = 0 . 0056; 95% CI for the difference between the sexes = [5 . 5% , 29 . 3%] ) . As groups , males and females were reasonably , but not perfectly discriminable in terms of the proportion of exploratory choices ( Figure 1G , receiver operating characteristic analysis , AUC = 0 . 76 ± 0 . 09 , 95% CI for the difference = [0 . 59 , 0 . 93] , p = 0 . 013 ) . These differences were largely driven by the greater male tendency to keep exploring once they started . Males repeated exploration 92 . 1 % ( ± 3 . 4 % STD ) of the time , while females stopped exploring and committed to a choice more quickly , repeating exploration only 83 . 1 % ( ± 16 . 8 % STD ) of the time ( t-test , t ( 30 ) = 2 . 09 , P = 0 . 045 , 95% CI for the difference = [0 . 2% , 17 . 8%] ) . There were no significant differences in the other parameter of the HMM ( probability of repeating exploitation: males = 83 . 5% ± 3 . 7%; females = 79 . 7 ± 22 . 1 %; t ( 30 ) = 0 . 69 , p = 0 . 5 ) . Since males had more exploratory trials , which took longer , we tested the possibility that the sex difference in response time was due to prolonged exploration in male by calculating a two-way ANOVA between explore-exploit state and sex in predicting response time . There was a significant main effect of state ( main effect of state: F ( 1 , 30 ) = 13 . 07 , p = 0 . 0011 ) , but males were slower during females during both exploitation and exploration ( main effect of sex , F ( 1 , 30 ) = 14 . 15 , p = 0 . 0007 ) and there was no significant interaction ( F ( 1 , 30 ) = 0 . 279 , p = 0 . 60 ) . We also examine whether the probability of exploration changed over trials or across sessions by calculating the probability of exploration early , mid , and late within one session and across sessions . However , we failed to see changes in the amount of exploration within sessions and across sessions in both males and females . Although sex differences in model parameters were modest , analyzing the full dynamics of the fitted HMMs again supported a robust sex difference in the tendency to explore ( see Materials and methods ) . In models fit to males , exploration was a deeper , more ‘sticky’ behavioral state ( Figure 1H , stationary probability of exploration = 68 . 0% ± 8 . 5% STD ) , compared to models fit to females , where exploration and exploitation were more closely matched ( 54 . 4% ± 18 . 4% STD; different from males: t ( 30 ) = 2 . 68 , p = 0 . 012 , 95% CI for the difference = [3 . 2% , 23 . 9%] ) . This suggests that males were more likely to get ‘stuck’ in an extended exploratory period , requiring more energy to escape from exploring and start exploiting a good choice . The results from the HMM analyses suggest that males were , on average , more exploratory than females , and not because they were more likely to initiate exploration , but because they were more likely to become ‘stuck’ in exploration . This suggests that there were sex differences in the animals’ approach to this task . However , a crucial question remained unanswered: what computational differences made the males more exploratory ? To address this question , we turned to reinforcement learning ( RL ) modeling to look for individual variability in latent cognitive parameters that could influence exploration and exploitation ( Daw et al . , 2006; Ishii et al . , 2002; Jepma and Nieuwenhuis , 2011; Pearson et al . , 2009 ) . RL models include multiple parameters that could influence exploration . Consider a simple , two-parameter RL model , with one learning rate parameter ( α ) and one parameter for decision noise ( inverse temperature β ) . Traditionally , only the latter parameter is thought to be related to exploration , and many previous studies of exploration have focused exclusively on this inverse temperature parameter ( Beeler et al . , 2010; Cinotti et al . , 2019 ) . However , exploration in an RL model should be a function of both the difference in subjective values and the decision-noise in the model . This is because both parameters increase the likelihood that agents will make non-reward-maximizing decisions ( Figure 2A ) . In the case of decision-noise , this happens because more choices deviate from reward-maximizing policies as noise increases . In the case of learning rate , this happens because the learning rate controls how quickly agents can move away from the regime in which decision-noise is highest . To test our intuition , we simulated data from a simple two-parameter RL model , then used the HMM to infer when and why exploration occurred . As expected , changing the decision-noise parameter ( β ) robustly changed the probability of exploration ( Figure 2B; GLM , main effect of inverse temperature , β1 = –0 . 11 , p < 0 . 0001 ) : the larger the inverse temperature , the lower the decision noise and the lower probability of exploration . Critically , learning rate ( ɑ ) also influenced the probability of exploration ( Figure 2B; GLM , main effect of learning rate , β2 = –0 . 10 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . In fact , there were some values for learning rate ( ɑ ) at which changing decision noise had no effect on exploration whatsoever: ɑ and β interacted to influence exploration ( Figure 2C; GLM , interaction term , β3 = –0 . 38 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . This occurred because when the learning rate was very low , agents failed to move away from the high-decision-noise regime at all , meaning that there was little effect of any additional noise . Thus , even in this simple two-parameter RL model , multiple latent , cognitive variables can influence exploration . Because of this ambiguity , it was not clear whether males explored more frequently because they had more decision-noise , because they learned less from rewards , or because there were changes in other decision-making or learning computations , like the tendency to simply repeat past choices . Fortunately , we can distinguish these possibilities via fitting RL models to the data . The HMM suggested that males and females had different levels of exploration , but it did not provide insight into the latent , cognitive processes behind these differences . Fortunately , RL models allow us to identify differences in a variety of latent cognitive variables that could influence exploration , either alone or in combination . However , our ability to make inferences about changes in model parameters is highly sensitive to the correct specification of the model , so we first had to identify the best-fitting RL model for these animals . There are many ways to parameterize RL models ( Katahira , 2018 ) , the majority of which can be put in three categories: value-dependent learning terms , value-independent bias terms , and decision noise/randomness terms . Previous studies have shown the effect of various RL parameters on decision making , including learning terms such as asymmetrical learning rate ( Frank et al . , 2007; Gershman , 2016 ) , bias terms such as choice bias ( Katahira , 2018; Wilson and Collins , 2019 ) , noise terms such as inverse temperature and lapse rate ( Economides et al . , 2015; Wilson and Collins , 2019 ) . Here , we compared seven reinforcement learning models that made different assumptions about the latent processes mice might be employing via different combinations of learning , bias , and noise terms . These models included: ( 1 ) a ‘random’ model with some overall bias for one choice over the other , ( 2 ) a ‘noisy win stay lose shift’ model that assumes a win stay lose shift policy with some level of randomness , ( 3 ) a two-parameter ‘RL’ model with a consistent learning rate and some inverse temperature that captures decision noise , ( 4 ) a three-parameter ‘RLε’ model with a consistent learning rate , and inverse temperature that captures value-based decision noise , and a value-independent noise , ( 5 ) a four-parameter ‘RLCK’ model that captures both value-based and value-independent decision with separate parameters for learning rate , decision noise , choice bias , and choice stickiness , ( 6 ) a five-parameter ‘RLCKγ’ model that incorporates differential learning rate for rewarded and unrewarded outcomes on top of the ‘RLCK’ model , ( 7 ) a five-parameter ‘RLCKη’ model that adds a parameter that tunes the weight between value-based and choice-based decision to the ‘RLCK’ model ( see Materials and methods , Figure 3A ) . Although model fitting was slightly different across sexes , in both males and females , the “RLCK” model , four-parameter model with value and choice kernel updating policies , best characterized animals’ choice behaviors in this task among all seven models ( Figure 3B ) . The fact that the ‘RLCK’ model was the best-fit model in both males and females does not mean both sexes had the same strategy or that RL modeling cannot capture those strategies . Instead , this may suggest that strategic differences between sexes may be more a matter of degree ( i . e . : differences in the specific values of model parameters ) , rather than a matter of categorically distinct computation . This interpretation also makes the most sense in light of the biology of sex differences , which produce few ( if any ) truly categorically distinct changes in neural function , but rather serve to bias neural systems across sexes in multiple complex ways . To quantify how well each RL model was at predicting animals’ choices , we measured the model agreement for each model , which was calculated as the probability of choice correctly predicted by the optimized model parameters for each model ( Figure 3C ) . Then we conducted a multiple comparison across model agreement of RL models ( test statistics reported in Supplementary file 2 ) . The results suggested that the RL models with parameter ( s ) that account for choice bias ( RLCK , RLCKγ , RLCKη ) were significantly better at predicting animals’ actual choices than the models that do not account for choice bias and non-RL models ( random , noisy WSLS , RL , RLε ) . There was no significant difference in model agreement between RLCK , RLCKγ , and RLCKη . Based on the result of model comparison ( AIC ) and model agreement , we decided that the four-parameter RLCK model is the simplest , best-fit model that best predicted animal’ actual choices . Finally , to visualize how well the RLCK model was at predicting choices of animals with different learning performance , we plotted the simulated choices and actual choices against the matching law ( Poling et al . , 2017 ) , which dictates that the probability of choice is proportional to the probability of reward . The figure showed that this four-parameter model was able to characterize animals’ choice behaviors regardless of the value-based learning performance ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . The RLCK model had four parameters , which we then compared across sexes . We found that females had significantly higher learning rate ( α ) than males ( Figure 3D , t ( 30 ) = 2 . 40 , p = 0 . 02 ) but there was no significant difference across sexes in other parameters ( β: t ( 30 ) = 1 . 44 , p = 0 . 16; αc: t ( 30 ) = 1 . 40 , P = 0 . 17; βc: t ( 30 ) = 1 . 73 , p = 0 . 09 ) . To examine whether the higher learning rate in females was driven by a few individuals with extremely high learning rates , we plotted the distribution and calculated the separability of learning rates of two sexes . As groups , males and females were reasonably discriminable in terms of the learning rate ( Figure 3E , receiver operating characteristic analysis , AUC = 0 . 72 ± 0 . 09 , 95% CI for the difference = [0 . 54 , 0 . 90] , p = 0 . 035 ) . These results suggested that the difference in the level of exploration between males and females was not due to differences in decision noise , but instead due to differences in learning rate . While females had significantly higher learning rate ( α ) than males , they did not obtain more rewards than males . This is because the learning rate parameter in an RL model does not equate to the learning performance , which is better measured by the number of rewards obtained . The learning rate parameter reflects the rate of value updating from past outcomes . Performing well in this task requires both the ability to learn new information and the ability to hang onto the previously learned information . That occurs when the learning rate is moderate but not maximal . When the learning rate is maximal ( α = 1 ) , only the outcome of the immediate past trial is taken into account for the current choice . This essentially reduces the strategy to a win-stay lose-shift strategy , where choice is fully dependent on the previous outcome . A higher learning rate in a RL model does not translate to better reward acquisition performance . To illustrate that different combinations of learning rate and decision noise can result in the same reward acquisition performance . We conducted computer simulations of 10 , 000 RL agents defined by different combinations of learning rate ( ɑ ) and inverse temperature ( β-1 ) and plotted their reward acquisition performance for the restless bandit task ( Figure 3F , temperature instead of inverse temperature was plotted for the ease of presentation ) . This figure demonstrates that ( 1 ) different learning rate and inverse temperature combinations can result in similar performance , ( 2 ) the optimal reward acquisition is achieved when learning rate is moderate . This result suggested that not only did males and females had identical performance , their optimized RL parameters put them both within the same predicted performance gradient in this plot . One interesting finding is that , when compared learning rate across sessions within sex , females , but not males , showed increased learning rate over experience with task ( Figure 3G , repeated measures ANOVA , female: main effect of time , F ( 2 . 26 , 33 . 97 ) = 5 . 27 , p = 0 . 008; male: main effect of time , F ( 2 . 5 , 37 . 52 ) = 0 . 23 , p = 0 . 84 ) . This points to potential sex differences in meta-learning that could contribute to the differential strategies across sexes . The results of HMM model and RL models revealed significant sex differences in exploration , paralleled by sex differences in rate of learning . What remains unclear is how sex , explore-exploit states , and reward outcomes all interact together to influence the animals’ choices . Therefore , we conducted a four-way repeated measures ANOVA to examine how ( 1 ) positive and negative outcomes , ( 2 ) explore-exploit states , ( 3 ) sex , and ( 4 ) subject identity ( nested in sex ) all came together to influence choice: whether animals would repeat their last choice ( stay ) or try a different option ( switch; Supplementary file 1 ) . This four-way repeated measure ANOVA allowed us to understand the main effect of sex , state , and outcome , as well as all pair and triplet-wise interaction effects , on how animals learned from previous rewards . Note that in previous analyses , we used subject averaged data but since subject average ( 16 subjects each sex ) is underpowered to detect a three-way interaction effect , we used session averaged data to increase the power to detect any effects across sex , state , and outcome . The results revealed an expected significant main effect of outcome on stay-switch decisions ( main effect of outcome , p < 0 . 00001 ) . This effect was driven by the tendency of animals to repeat the previous choice ( i . e . : not switching ) after obtaining a reward ( post hoc t-test compared to chance at 0 . 50 , mean = 0 . 75 , 95% CI = [0 . 74 , 0 . 77] , t ( 255 ) =34 . 33 , p < 0 . 0001 ) and a much smaller tendency to switch more often than chance after reward omission ( mean = 0 . 52 , 95% CI = [0 . 50 , 0 . 55] , post hoc t-test , t ( 255 ) = 2 . 05 , p = 0 . 04 ) . The tendency to switch or stay also differed by sex , with females more likely to repeat a previous choice and males more likely to switch ( main effect of sex , p < 0 . 00001; post-hoc t-test on p ( switch ) : t ( 254 ) = 4 . 12 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . There was also a significant interaction effect between sex and outcome ( sex X reward interaction , p < 0 . 00001 ) . To understand how reward and reward omission differentially affect choice across sexes , we conducted post-hoc win-stay lose-shift analyses . We found that female mice displayed more win-stay behaviors , indicating that they were more likely than the males to repeat behaviors that produced reward on the previous trial ( Figure 4A , sex X reward interaction , p < 0 . 000001 , Supplementary file 1; post hoc t-test: t ( 254 ) = 5 . 53 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . As groups , males and females were reasonably , but not perfectly discriminable in terms of the proportion of win stay choices ( Figure 4B , receiver operating characteristic analysis , AUC = 0 . 74 ± 0 . 09 , 95% CI for the difference = [0 . 56 , 0 . 92] , p = 0 . 0195 ) . In contrast , male mice tended to shift even when the previous choice was rewarded . There was no significant sex difference in learning from losses ( Figure 4C and t ( 25 ) = 1 . 40 , p = 0 . 16 ) , but this did not mean that sex differences in learning were solely due to sex differences in learning from wins . There were at least two ways that we could observe an equivalent tendency to lose-shift across sexes in this task . One possibility is that females only learn more from positive outcomes , but not negative ones . However , the other possibility is that this lack of a difference in lose-shift behaviors between males and females was an artifact of the tendency of males to explore more frequently . Since males spend more time exploring ( Figure 1E ) and learning from both wins and losses is enhanced during exploration ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2F ) , males could lose-shift less frequently than females during both exploration and exploitation , yet still lose-shift exactly as much as females because a greater proportion of their choices were exploratory . To dissociate these possibilities , we next examined the effects of exploration and exploitation . The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of state , resonating with the result of HMM model validation that animals were more likely to switch during exploratory state than during exploitative state ( Supplementary file 1 , main effect of state , p < 0 . 00001; sex X state interaction , p = 0 . 0667; Figure 1—figure supplement 2F ) . Critically , there was also a significant three-way interaction between sex , explore/exploit state , and reward ( Figure 4F , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 , Supplementary file 1 , sex X reward X state interaction , p = 0 . 0438 ) . This could imply sex-linked differences in reward learning across exploration and exploitation . To determine if this was true , we separated out the probability of lose-shift according to whether it happened during exploration or exploitation , as inferred from the Hidden Markov model . Males switched less after losses than females within exploratory states ( Figure 4D; post hoc t-test on session averages: sex difference within exploration: p < 0 . 001 , t ( 251 ) = 3 . 39 ) , though there was no significant sex difference within exploitation ( p = 0 . 06 , t ( 243 ) = 1 . 87; note that differing degrees of freedom are due to the fact that exploitation was not observed in some sessions for some animals ) . This supported the second hypothesis that males lose-shift less than females both when exploring and when exploiting , but that there was no difference in lose-shift overall because males spent more time in a state in which both win-stay and lose-shift choices occur more frequently ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2F ) . We also found that the increased tendency to win-stay that we observed in females was driven by the explore choices ( Figure 4E; post-hoc t-test: p = 0 . 015 , t ( 251 ) = 2 . 55 ) . There was no significant difference in win-stay between males and females during exploit choices ( post-hoc t-test: p = 0 . 09 , t ( 244 ) = 1 . 68 ) . Together these results suggest that females were better explorers ( i . e . : they had increased reward learning during exploration ) , whereas males learned slower during exploration but compensated for this learning disadvantage by exploring more frequently . These effects were not driven by idiosyncratic strategic differences between the sexes ( e . g . shifting only after two losses ) . We used a model-free approach to quantify the extent to which behavior was structured without making strong assumptions about what form this structure might take . We calculated conditioned mutual information for all sessions across sexes ( Leao et al . , 2004; Wyner , 1978 ) , to examine how choice behavior was influenced by information of past choice history , given the immediate outcome . The result suggested that mutual information was higher in females than males , suggesting that females were using more information from the past choice and outcome to make their current decision . ( Figure 4G , t ( 30 ) = 2 . 65 , p = 0 . 013 ) . As groups , males and females were reasonably discriminable in terms of mutual information ( Figure 4H , receiver operating characteristic analysis , AUC = 0 . 74 ± 0 . 09 , 95% CI for the difference = [0 . 57 , 0 . 92] , p = 0 . 0195 ) . Together , these results reinforced our conclusion that females were learning more: utilizing more information from the past trial to make current choices . 
 Sex mechanisms biasing the preferred approaches taken during cognitive tasks are potentially significant contributors to task performance . We used a combination of computational modeling approaches to characterize sex differences in a canonical explore/exploit task . While males and females had similar performance , they used different latent explore-exploit strategies to learn about the dynamic environment . Males explored more than females and were more likely to ‘get stuck’ in an extended period of exploration before committing to a favored choice . In contrast , females were more likely to show elevated learning during the exploratory period , making exploration more efficient and allowing them to start exploiting a favored choice earlier . Furthermore , the learning rate increased over days in females but stayed stable in males . Such meta-learning in females permitted learning about the current task ( which option provides the best reward outcome ) , as well as the structure of the task ( the reward probability of choices changes over time ) . This allowed them to shift more quickly to exploit a rewarding option when they found one and only explored when the current option failed to provide valuable rewards . Together , these results demonstrate that while the overall performance was similar , males and females tended to adopt different strategies for interacting with the same uncertain environment . The difference in explore-exploit strategies across sexes may provide us insight into potential sex-modulated mechanisms that are implicated in learning under uncertainty . Our major finding that males learned less during exploration and explored for longer is consistent with two explanations . First , males learned more slowly during exploration and as a result , they had to explore for longer to learn which option was worth exploiting . Another possibility is that males got ‘stuck’ in extended periods of exploration that prohibited them from applying the knowledge they have learned and committing to a rewarding option . In this view , it takes some energy to stop exploring and transition to exploit . As we have shown in our result , males had ‘deeper’ exploratory states and they were more likely to keep exploring once started . These two explanations are not mutually exclusive because changes in learning could contribute to changes in the stickiness of exploration and vice versa . This essentially presents a chicken and egg problem . It is difficult to distinguish from behavior alone whether slower learning drives longer exploration , or vice versa , if being stuck in exploration results in slower learning . Neural measures during explore and exploit choices across sexes may help us differentiate learning signals from signals that drive exploration , and whether these signals are sex-different . Answering these neural questions will require a way to reliably identify latent exploration and exploitation states . The Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) has been used to infer trial-by-trial exploration and exploitation in non-human primates ( Ebitz et al . , 2018 ) . The HMM inferred latent goal states explained more variance in neural activity than other decision-variables ( Ebitz et al . , 2018 ) . In our data , we have shown for the first time that the HMM model was able to label a meaningful exploratory state that matches normative definitions of exploration in the mouse model . In the future , this computational tool can complement neurobiological recording techniques to examine for neural correlates of exploration on a trial-by-trial basis , and permit the visualization of dynamic landscapes of choice behavior across individuals ( as in Figure 1H ) or with pharmacological or other challenges ( Ebitz et al . , 2019 ) . Reinforcement learning ( RL ) models have also been used in the past to identify levels of exploration across individuals ( Daw et al . , 2006; Pearson et al . , 2009 ) . However , our findings indicate that multiple latent parameters can influence how much these models explore . Here , we found that differences in exploration between the sexes were due to differences in learning rates , not due to differences in the decision noise parameter , which is more commonly associated with exploration . While RL models are helpful for understanding cognitive or computational mechanisms , they are limited in their ability to identify when exploration is happening . The HMM model , conversely , provides no insight into mechanisms , but can tell us precisely when exploration is occurring , both in animal behaviors and RL models ( Ebitz et al . , 2018 ) . By combining the HMM and RL approaches , we capitalized on the advantages of both frameworks: linking changes in exploration across sexes to underlying mechanisms of exploration . Since the broader reinforcement learning model framework is highly adaptive and amenable , in the future , the HMM and kinds of model-free analyses we completed here could also inform the design of RL models to capture explore-exploit decisions more precisely . Future work is needed to understand the neurobiological bases of these observations . One neuromodulator that is implicated in reinforcement learning , including the transition between exploration and exploitation , and is strongly sex-modulated is dopamine ( Beeler et al . , 2010; Jenni et al . , 2017 ) . Studies have shown that dopamine signals regulate exploration via mechanisms of action selection and learning ( Beeler et al . , 2010; Frank et al . , 2009; Humphries et al . , 2012 ) . However , due to the exclusive use of males in many foundational experiments ( Beeler et al . , 2010; Cinotti et al . , 2019 ) , the fact that dopamine function on decision making is strongly modulated by sex and sex-linked mechanisms is often overlooked . For example , estradiol has been demonstrated to exert both acute and chronic modulatory effects on dopamine release , reuptake , and receptor binding ( Yoest et al . , 2014 ) , allowing enhanced DA release and faster DA clearance in females ( Becker , 1999 ) . This mechanism could contribute to increased reward learning observed in females during exploration . The prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , which receives dopamine projections , is a target brain region to understand exploration and exploitation ( Ebitz et al . , 2018; Jenni et al . , 2017 ) . Our previous study implicated PFC in the differences in learning strategy between males and females ( Chen et al . , 2021b ) . It is possible that prefrontal cortical dopamine is particularly engaged in implementing explore-exploit strategies via sex-biased mechanisms of learning . Rodent operant testing is frequently used to assess cognitive functions . This is critical for translational work in animals needed to link pharmacology , genetics , and other potential biological contributors to behavior ( Grissom and Reyes , 2019 ) . However , many classic rodent cognitive tasks are species-specific: they were not designed to assess the same cognitive processes across species , and this limits their translational ability . Currently , there is an emerging exciting trend among rodent researchers with adopting tasks with translational potentials in rodents , such as reversal learning and various versions of bandit task ( Izquierdo et al . , 2019; Groman et al . , 2016; Bari et al . , 2019; Grossman et al . , 2021 ) , where we can assess the same cognitive processes across species and across animal models of diseases . Here , we establish that explore-exploit decisions are shared cognitive processes across species , making this restless bandit task an ideal tool for translational research . Parallel approaches in humans have been used to examine the explore-exploit strategic phenotype of neuropsychiatric disorders , including ADHD , addiction , and depression ( Addicott et al . , 2021; Addicott et al . , 2012; Beeler et al . , 2012; Blanco et al . , 2013 ) . The computational modeling used here permits fine grained quantification of individual variability in latent parameters that capture adaptive changes in exploration in changing environments . The computational approaches we develop here could help identify behavioral endophenotypes across species underlying a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and open up new avenues for understanding as well as rescuing dysfunction in value-based decision making . 
 Thirty-two BL6129SF1/J mice ( 16 males and 16 females ) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories ( stock #101043 ) . Mice arrived at the lab at 7 weeks of age , and they were housed in groups of four with ad libitum access to water while being mildly food restricted ( 85–95% of free feeding weight ) for the experiment . Animals engaging in operant testing were housed in a 0900–2100 hours reversed light cycle to permit testing during the dark period . Before operant chamber training , animals were food restricted to 85–90% of free feeding body weight . Operant testing occurred five days per week ( Monday-Friday ) . All animals were cared for according to the guidelines of the National Institution of Health and the University of Minnesota . Sixteen identical triangular touchscreen operant chambers ( Lafayette Instrument Co . , Lafayette , IN ) were used for training and testing . Two walls were black acrylic plastic . The third wall housed the touchscreen and was positioned directly opposite the magazine . The magazine provided liquid reinforcer ( Ensure ) delivered by a peristaltic pump , typically 7 µl ( 280 ms pump duration ) . ABET-II software ( Lafayette Instrument Co . , Lafayette , IN ) was used to program operant schedules and to analyze all data from training and testing .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['computational and systems biology', 'neuroscience']",elife-69748-v3,66,8054,7988,122.03030303030303

Through modulation  and molecular interactions resulting changes within tissues such structures ; hence leading ultimately influencing cellular behavior patterns associated primarily With regardless pathways involving epithelial adhesion molecules upon completion   This paper presents evidence suggesting potential therapeutic interventions related closely connected subject matter","In many animals , the skull is made of several separate bones that are loosely joined during childhood and only fuse into one piece when the animal stops growing . A genetic disease called Carpenter syndrome causes the bones of the skull to fuse early in life , stopping it from growing correctly . Carpenter syndrome is often caused by changes to the gene responsible for making a protein called RAB23 . RAB23 helps move other molecules and cell components between different parts of the cell , and is therefore involved in a number of cellular processes . Previous studies suggest that RAB23 has a role in many parts of the body during development . Yet , it is unclear which cells in the skull depend on RAB23 activity and how this protein is controlled . To answer this question , Hasan et al . grew pieces of developing skull bones that had been taken from mice lacking the RAB23 protein in the laboratory . Examining these samples revealed that RAB23 is active in cells called osteoblasts that add new bone to the edge of each piece of the skull as it grows . Hasan et al . also found that RAB23 regulates two cellular signaling pathways – called the hedgehog pathway and the fibroblast growth factor pathway – that interact with one another and co-ordinate skull development . These findings show how RAB23 controls the growth and fusion of skull bones in developing animals . This could improve our understanding of the role RAB23 plays in other processes during development . It also sheds light on the mechanisms of Carpenter syndrome which may inform new approaches for treating patients .","Mutations in the gene encoding Ras-associated binding protein 23 ( RAB23 ) cause Carpenter Syndrome , which is characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities including polysyndactyly and defects in skull morphogenesis . To understand how RAB23 regulates skull development , we generated Rab23-deficient mice that survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied . Along with polysyndactyly , these mice exhibit premature fusion of multiple sutures resultant from aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture . FGF10-driven FGFR1 signaling is elevated in Rab23-/-sutures with a consequent imbalance in MAPK , Hedgehog signaling and RUNX2 expression . Inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 signaling results in the normalization of osteoprogenitor proliferation with a concomitant reduction of osteogenic gene expression , and prevention of craniosynostosis . Our results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream negative regulator of both FGFR and canonical Hh-GLI1 signaling , and additionally in the non-canonical regulation of GLI1 through pERK1/2 . 
 Ras-associated binding protein 23 ( RAB23 ) belongs to the RAB family of small GTPases , which function during several steps in cell vesicle trafficking ( Evans et al . , 2003 ) . RAB23 has 35–40% sequence homology with other RABs , it localizes to the plasma membrane and is proposed to regulate cargo internalization and relocation in the cell ( Evans et al . , 2003; Leaf and Von Zastrow , 2015; Lim and Tang , 2015; Olkkonen et al . , 1994 ) . RAB23 is unusual amongst RABs as it is involved in embryogenesis , for instance in heart and limb patterning , neural tube closure and skeletal development ( Eggenschwiler and Anderson , 2000; Eggenschwiler et al . , 2001; Fuller et al . , 2014; Günther et al . , 1994; Hor and Goh , 2018 ) . RAB23 negatively regulates Hh signaling during mouse neural tube development ( Eggenschwiler and Anderson , 2000 ) , and it controls nodal signaling independently of Hh signaling during vertebrate left-right patterning ( Fuller et al . , 2014 ) . RAB23 is involved in trafficking D1-type dopaminergic receptors ( Leaf and Von Zastrow , 2015 ) and kinesin-2 motor protein Kif-17 ( Lim and Tang , 2015 ) to the primary cilium . However , direct ciliary function of RAB23 is unclear as cilium length and function are reported normal in Rab23-/- mice ( Evans et al . , 2003; Fuller et al . , 2014 ) . Multiple mutations in RAB23 have been reported in patients with the autosomal recessive Carpenter syndrome; the majority of mutations result in nonsense-mediated decay while others include missense and in-frame deletions ( Jenkins et al . , 2011 ) . Carpenter syndrome ( CS , MIM #201000 ) or Acrocephalopolysyndactyly type II is a multi-organ developmental disorder with polysyndactyly , congenital heart defects , mental retardation , obesity and craniosynostosis as central features ( Carpenter , 1909; Jenkins et al . , 2007 ) . Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of one or more craniofacial sutures that results in major disruption of face and skull growth . Mesenchymal cells in the center of the suture must be kept in an undifferentiated state to maintain suture patency , while progenitor cells at the osteogenic fronts proliferate and differentiate to facilitate bone growth . Suture biogenesis is dependent on the correct patterning of the skeletal elements , as well as the regulation of the mesenchymal stem cell niche , osteogenic condensation formation , osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation ( Rice and Rice , 2008; Twigg and Wilkie , 2015 ) . These developmental processes are regulated to permit coordinated craniofacial growth , without the fusion of the neighboring bones and consequent cessation of growth . Mutations in FGFRs are a major cause of syndromic craniosynostosis , with many of the mutations conferring a gain of function ( Hajihosseini , 2008; Wilkie et al . , 2017 ) . FGFRs isoforms show a distinct FGF ligand binding affinity and biological functions ( Ornitz and Itoh , 2015 ) . However , studies have shown that in an Apert syndrome ( FGFR2 mutation ) mouse model isoform FGFR2c loses ligand specificity , and is able to bind with cognate FGF10 ( Ibrahimi et al . , 2001; Ibrahimi et al . , 2004; Johnson and Wilkie , 2011; Yu et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , genetic knockdown of Fgf10 in this mouse model could rescue the premature fusion ( Hajihosseini et al . , 2009 ) . FGF signaling pathway members have not been linked to RAB23-mediated trafficking . However , study suggests that RAB23 resides in the plasma membrane and proposed to be involved in endocytosis ( Evans et al . , 2003 ) . In this context , RAB23 might have a direct role in growth factor receptor recycling and turnover , and therefore regulate the availability of the FGF receptors at the cell surface ( Langemeyer et al . , 2018; Zerial and McBride , 2001 ) . Similar to Carpenter syndrome , several craniosynostosis syndromes caused by mutations in FGFRs are characterized by patients exhibiting syndactyly and occasionally polysyndactyly ( Goos and Mathijssen , 2019; Mantilla-Capacho et al . , 2005 ) . Also , mutations in several hedgehog ( Hh ) pathway members cause polydactyly ( Malik , 2014; Ullah et al . , 2019 ) . Notably , Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome ( MIM # 175700 ) is caused by haploinsufficiency of the Hh signaling negative regulator , GLI3 ( Vortkamp et al . , 1991 ) . In addition to the polysyndactyly , some patients with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome exhibit craniosynostosis , and the mouse model for Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome ( Gli3Xt-J/Xt-J ) shows complete phenotypic penetrance for both craniosynostosis and polydactyly ( Hurst et al . , 2011; Rice et al . , 2010 ) . Also , a recurrent mosaic mutation in the hedgehog receptor Smoothened ( SMO ) causes craniosynostosis and polysyndactyly ( Twigg et al . , 2016 ) . These overlapping skeletal phenotypes caused by mutations in FGFRs , Hh regulators and RAB23 are suggestive of common etiological mechanisms . FGF and Hh signaling have well-defined roles during intramembranous osteogenesis . FGF signaling regulates many stages including mesenchymal condensation formation , osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation and activation of the osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2 ( Debiais et al . , 1998; Kim et al . , 1998; Ornitz and Itoh , 2015; Yoon et al . , 2014 ) . IHH positively regulates osteoprogenitor recruitment to the osteogenic front and GLI transcription factors regulate stem cell maintenance and osteoprogenitor proliferation ( Lenton et al . , 2011; Rice et al . , 2010; Veistinen et al . , 2012; Zhao et al . , 2015 ) . Interestingly , RAB23 regulates GLI1 in a Su ( Fu ) -dependent manner ( Chi et al . , 2012 ) and GLI1-positive cells have been identified in the suture as the main source of mesenchymal stem cells that plays crucial role in suture patency ( Zhao et al . , 2015 ) . The aim of this study was to determine the role of RAB23 during intramembranous bone development . Previously , it has not been possible to study skeletal development in RAB23 deficient mice due to their early lethality . Here , we generated RAB23 deficient ( Rab23-/- ) mice that survived until embryonic day ( E ) 18 . 5 , and this allowed us to investigate how RAB23 regulates bone formation . Similar to Carpenter syndrome patients , RAB23 deficient mice exhibited polysyndactyly and multiple craniosynostoses . We show that disruption of Rab23 leads to an upregulation of Pitx2 , Fgf10 and Fgfr1b expression , decreased p38 and enhanced pERK1/2-RUNX2 signaling along with elevated osteoprogenitor proliferation . In addition , Hh signaling was amplified with increased expression of GLI1 . During in vitro culture , inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 normalized osteoprogenitor proliferation , corrected the aberrant GLI1 and RUNX2 expressions , and rescued the lambdoid suture fusion . Our results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream regulator of both FGF10-pERK1/2 and Hh-GLI1 , and the additional regulation of GLI1 by pERK1/2 , to coordinate the initiation of osteogenesis . 
 Rab23 open brain 2 ( opb2 ) homozygous mutant mice did not produce RAB23 protein in primary cells , analyzed by western blot ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) and will therefore be referred to as Rab23-/- mice . Rab23-/- C3 Heb/FeJ mice , generated through an ENU screen , survive until E12 . 5 rendering full analysis of organogenesis impossible ( Eggenschwiler et al . , 2001; Kasarskis et al . , 1998 ) . To obviate the gestation lethality before skeletal development , we backcrossed Rab23-/- C3 Heb/FeJ mice onto the C57Bl/6 strain . After six generations , the survival of the Rab23-/- homozygote embryos were prolonged to E18 . 5 , and this allowed us to study skeletal development of these mice . Rab23-/- mice at embryonic day E18 . 5 exhibited craniosynostosis in the coronal , parietal-temporal , fronto-nasal and in the lambdoid sutures when compared to their wild type ( Wt ) littermates ( Figure 1A–E ) . The prevalence of premature suture fusion in Rab23-/- mice represented as percentage and only parieto-temporal sutures showed bi-lateral suture fusion ( 100% ) in all the samples ( Figure 1F ) . Along with craniosynostosis , Rab23-/- mice showed skeletal patterning defects in the forelimbs and hindlimbs . Rab23-/- mice showed pre-axial polydactyly ( seven digits ) of the forelimb and preaxial polysyndactyly ( seven digits ) of the hindlimbs ( Figure 1G ) . Polydactyly and craniosynostosis were observed ( 100% ) in all Rab23-/- samples examined . At E18 . 5 , 5% of Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures exhibited unilateral suture fusion ( Figure 1F ) . Compared to Wt samples ( Figure 1I ) , unfused Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures showed abnormal bony protrusions from parietal bones toward interparietal bone ( Figure 1J ) or ectopic bones in the lambdoid suture ( Figure 1K ) . At this stage , Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures were narrower than Wt lambdoid sutures ( Figure 1L ) . As 95% of Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures were consistently patent at E18 . 5 they were chosen as a model to study the role of RAB23 in osteogenesis . Rab23-/- mice die neonatally , therefore , analysis of Rab23-/- lambdoid suture beyond the E18 . 5 stage was assessed by in vitro calvarial explant culture ( Rice et al . , 2003b; Figure 1M ) . Wt and patent Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures harvested for culture at E18 . 5 , Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures fused predictably after 3 days of culture ( Figure 1N , O ) . Rab23 mRNA expression was analyzed in whole calvaria and tissue sections by in situ hybridization and protein expression by immunohistochemical staining and western blotting . Rab23 was expressed in suture mesenchyme with the strongest signal in interfrontal , sagittal and coronal sutures and parietal bone side of the lambdoid suture ( Figure 1P–a ) . Analysis of tissue sections revealed Rab23 expression in the osteogenic fronts of the calvarial sutures and throughout the sutural mesenchyme ( Figure 1P–b ) . RAB23 was expressed in the lambdoid sutural osteogenic fronts and in the underlying cartilage . Co-expression with RUNX2 confirmed the cells in the osteogenic front to be osteoprogenitor or osteoblast ( Figure 1P–c ) . The Rab23 expression pattern was consistent with the phenotype of synostosed calvarial sutures observed in the Rab23-/- mice ( Figure 1B , C and E ) . Western blotting of proteins extracted from E15 . 5 Wt calvarial frontal , sagittal and lambdoid sutures along with their osteogenic fronts confirmed the presence of RAB23 protein in the suture ( Figure 1P–d ) . To investigate differentially expressed genes between Wt and Rab23-/- calvaria and to find candidate genes responsible for the craniosynostosis in the RAB23-deficient mice , we performed a microarray-based gene expression analysis of whole Wt and Rab23-/- calvaria samples excluding the skin and underlying brain at E15 . 5 ( Figure 2A ) . Our analysis revealed 223 significantly differentially expressed genes between the Wt and Rab23-/- calvaria ( t-test , p<0 . 05 ) ( Figure 2B , Supplementary file 1 , MIAME-compliant data has been deposited in GEO database as source data , GEO accession GSE140884 ) . Among these genes , 115 genes were upregulated ( Figure 2B , red ) and 108 genes were downregulated ( Figure 2B , green ) . Fgf10 was found to be overexpressed in the microarray in Rab23-/- calvaria ( Figure 2C ) . Fgf10 was selected as a candidate for further analysis as it has previously been shown to be expressed early in calvarial development and has been implicated in craniosynostosis pathogenesis ( Hajihosseini et al . , 2009; Veistinen et al . , 2009 ) . Fgf10 expression was elevated in whole calvarial mesenchyme , lambdoid sutural mesenchymal tissue and in calvaria derived ( CD ) mesenchymal cells at E15 . 5 as assessed by RT-qPCR ( Figure 2D ) . Our microarray analysis also showed that the transcription factor Pitx2 was elevated in Rab23-/- calvaria ( Figure 2C ) . Pitx2 is a well-documented upstream regulator of Fgf10 and may act in a reciprocal regulatory loop with FGF10 during early organogenesis ( Al Alam et al . , 2012 ) . We found that Pitx2 was overexpressed both in the Rab23-/- calvaria and in Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures ( Figure 2E ) . Pitx2 overexpression was further observed in Rab23-/- calvaria by whole-mount in situ hybridization in and surrounding the interparietal bone ( Figure 2F ) . We assessed the expression of FGF10-specific receptors Fgfr1b , Fgfr2b , also Fgfr2c in Wt and Rab23-/- lambdoid sutural mesenchymal tissue . Our analysis showed elevated Fgfr1b expression and a non-significant upregulation of Fgfr2b in Rab23-/- samples ( Figure 2G ) . FGFR1 protein levels were found to be elevated in Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures compared to Wt samples when analyzed by western blotting ( Figure 2H , I ) and by immunohistochemical staining ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . The expression of Fgfr2c was unchanged ( Figure 2G ) . To test whether the upregulation of Fgfr1b and Fgfr2b expression was due to the high levels of FGF10 ligand present in the Rab23-/- lambdoid suture , we isolated E15 . 5 wild-type calvaria derived ( CD ) mesenchymal cells and treated them with exogenous FGF10 ( 250 ng/ml ) for 3 hr . Fgfr1b and Fgfr2b expression levels were then assessed by RT-qPCR . We found a significant ( p=0 . 05 ) upregulation of Fgfr1b expression and a slight upregulation of Fgfr2b expression in the cultured CD mesenchymal cells after exogenous FGF10 stimulation , indicating FGFR1b as a target of FGF10 in the calvarial mesenchyme ( Figure 2J ) . FGF signaling has been shown to activate MAPK signaling pathway subtypes pERK and p38 in suture morphogenesis and osteoblast differentiation ( Kyono et al . , 2012; Pfaff et al . , 2016; Figure 3A ) . In Rab23-/- lambdoid suture , we found decreased p38 and elevated pERK1/2 and RUNX2 expressions compare to Wt samples ( Figure 3B–G ) . To test whether the upregulation of RUNX2 expression was due to the high levels of FGF10 present in the Rab23-/- lambdoid suture , we isolated E15 . 5 Rab23-/- calvaria derived ( CD ) mesenchymal cells and treated them with exogenous FGF10 ( 500 ng/ml ) for 2 and 4 hr . Runx2 expression levels were then assessed by RT-qPCR . We found a significant ( p<0 . 05 ) upregulation of Runx2 expression at both time points compare to untreated samples , indicating that RUNX2 as a target of FGF10 in the calvarial mesenchyme ( Figure 3H ) . Since ERK1/2 signaling regulates Hh and GLI expression , and RAB23 is a known negative regulator of Hh signaling ( Eggenschwiler et al . , 2001 ) , we further assayed Hh , Gli1 , Gli2 , and Gli3 transcripts extracted from Wt and Rab23-/- lambdoid sutural mesenchyme at E15 . 5 . We detected a dramatic increase in the expression of Hh ( Figure 3I ) and Gli1 ( Figure 3J ) , a sutural stem cell marker ( Zhao et al . , 2015 ) . Although Gli3 expression is not changed , a functional change in the ratio of GLI3FL to GLI3R may still possible ( Veistinen et al . , 2017 ) . As TGFβ-superfamily members have also been shown to regulate suture patency ( Kim et al . , 1998; Komatsu et al . , 2013; Pan et al . , 2017 ) , we assayed both pSMAD1/5/8 and pSMAD2/3 expressions but found no difference between Wt and mutant samples ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . As FGF10-pERK1/2 signaling and RUNX2 are known to regulate suture osteoprogenitor proliferation ( Kim et al . , 1998; Qin et al . , 2019 ) , we assessed co-expression of EdU and RUNX2 in the WT and Rab23-/- lambdoid suture . EdU and RUNX2 co-localized in the osteogenic fronts indicating that the proliferating cells are osteoprogenitors ( Figure 4A , B ) . We analyzed the proliferation in Wt and Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures ( Figure 4C–H ) . EdU pulsed Rab23-/- samples showed more proliferating cells in the osteogenic fronts compared to Wt ( Figure 4C–H ) . In addition , increased level of cell proliferation was observed in Rab23-/- derived mouse embryonic fibroblast ( MEF ) cells ( Figure 4I ) . Rab23-/- calvaria derived cells also had an elevated number of total cells at different passages ( P1 to P3 ) when compared to Wt calvaria derived cells ( Figure 4J ) . Increased proliferation in the sutures can result in a larger pool of osteoprogenitor cells and enhanced osteogenesis ( Lana-Elola et al . , 2007; Rice et al . , 2003b ) . Taken together , this data shows that RAB23 is needed to repress proliferation in undifferentiated mesenchymal cells . Our data suggest that Rab23-/- lambdoid suture undergoes fusion through aberrant FGF signaling , specifically by activating pERK1/2 signaling , RUNX2 and enhanced cell proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells . To test this , we aimed to normalize the Rab23-/- lambdoid suture by inhibiting the activation of MEK1/2 , a downstream component of the MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway by using MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 . We cultured E18 . 5 Wt and Rab23-/- whole calvaria in osteogenic growth medium up to 72 hr . To confirm that lambdoid sutures were patent at time point zero , the vital bone dye calcein green was used to detect the bone edges . Calcein green was administered to pregnant females 24 hr before samples were taken . Half of the Rab23-/- calvaria were treated with U0126 and half of the Rab23-/- calvaria samples were untreated ( Figure 5A , B ) . None of the untreated Rab23-/- ( n = 0/12 ) and 84 . 34% of U0126 treated Rab23-/- ( n = 11/12 ) lambdoid sutures were rescued ( Figure 5A , B ) . To confirm whether bones were fused or not , Wt , U0126 treated and untreated Rab23-/- samples were further analyzed in tissue sections and by µ-CT ( Figure 5A–C , Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5—Videos 1–3 ) . None of the Wt lambdoid sutures were fused ( n = 0/12 ) . The same experiment ( n = 4 in each genotype ) was carried out with E17 . 5 samples and cultured for 4 days . Untreated Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures underwent suture fusion by day 4 , while U0126-treated Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures remained patent during the culture period ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2 ) . The effect of U0126 on sutural cells was also analyzed by cell death assay and no effect was observed in U0126-treated lambdoid sutural cells ( Figure 5—figure supplement 3 ) . U0126 treatment not only prevented suture fusion but it also normalized the level of osteoprogenitor cell proliferation ( Figure 5D–G ) . EdU incorporation revealed that U0126 treated Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures ( n = 8 ) exhibited reduced proliferation when compared to Rab23-/- controls ( n = 8 ) ( Figure 5D–G ) and normalized it to Wt levels ( n = 8 ) after 24 hr of culture ( Figure 5D , E ) . The proliferation in all genotypes decreased over time ( Figure 5D–G ) . This indicates that RAB23 regulates suture patency through a MAPK-MEK-ERK-driven mechanism . pERK1/2 regulates RUNX2 and GLI1 expression in calvaria derived mesenchymal cells . We analyzed the effect of the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 , cyclopamine and the combined action of cyclopamine and U0126 on pERK1/2 , RUNX2 and GLI1 expression levels in Rab23-/- CD cells at 6 , 24 and 48 hr of culture ( Figure 6 ) . After 6 hr of culture , the relative pERK1/2 levels were significantly reduced in U0126-treated Rab23-/- cells compare to untreated Rab23-/- cells . The downregulation of pERK1/2 continued in U0126-treated Rab23-/- cells at 24 and 48 hr of culture compare to the untreated Rab23-/- cells ( Figure 6A , B ) . Whereas , RUNX2 expression significantly reduced only after 48 hr of U0126-treated Rab23-/- cells ( Figure 6A , C ) . U0126-treated Rab23-/- cells showed gradual reduction of GLI1 expressions at 6 and 24 hr; however , it showed drastic reduction at 48 hr compared to untreated Rab23-/- cells ( Figure 6A , D ) . Further immunohistochemical expression of GLI1 was also found reduced in the U0126 treated Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures at 24 and 48 hr compared to untreated Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) . The effect of cyclopamine and combined action of cyclopamine and U0126 on these cells showed that cyclopamine has no effect on pERK1/2 expression and can reduce RUNX2 expression only after prolonged exposure ( 48 hr ) ( Figure 6E-H ) . However , the combined action of cyclopamine and U0126 caused a rapid downregulation of RUNX2 ( 24 hr ) ( Figure 6E-H ) . These findings collectively indicate that pERK1/2 regulates RUNX2 and GLI1 expressions . Whereas , RUNX2 is a predominant downstream target of pERK1/2 and a weak target of GLI1 . 
 The calvarial suture allows us to study many developmental processes that regulate osteogenesis and skull morphogenesis . Normal development is ensured by the correct temporal and spatial coordination of skeletal patterning , mesenchymal stem cell niche regulation , condensation formation , osteoprogenitor expansion , and osteoblast differentiation and function . In this study , we generated Rab23-deficient mice that survive into late gestation and they exhibit multiple suture craniosynostosis . We show that RAB23 regulates the sutural stem cell niche marker GLI1 , represses Hh , and inhibits osteoprogenitor expansion . RAB23 also represses FGF10-driven pERK1/2 signaling which has the multiple effect of directly regulating osteoprogenitor development , RUNX2-mediated differentiation and of repressing GLI1 . Therefore , RAB23 coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating FGF-ERK1/2-RUNX2 activity , as well as the activation of GLI1 . In an attempt to study complex developmental events , we have utilized both primary cells and organ culture approaches . However , one can also take a more cell biological approach using immortalized cells remote from the external factors and by using this standardized approach it may be easier to understand the effects of a specific intervention . This will be help deciphering the role of RAB23 , specifically during endocytosis . FGF10 signaling regulates early osteogenesis: it is expressed in the osteogenic condensation , and is implicated in the pathogenesis of several craniosynostotic models ( Twigg and Wilkie , 2015; Veistinen et al . , 2009 ) . Here , we show that Fgf10 , its receptor FGFR1b and the FGF activator Pitx2 , are all upregulated in Rab23-deficient calvaria . It is surprising that the FGFR1b splice form , which is normally expressed in epithelia , is upregulated in the mesenchymal suture . However , this is not without precedent . While FGFRc isoforms are predominantly expresses in the mesenchyme and b isoforms in the epithelium , their expression is not mutually exclusive and FGFR1b is known to be expressed by late embryonic murine lung mesenchymal cells and also in the zebrafish in the sutural mesenchyme ( Al Alam et al . , 2015; Rice et al . , 2003b; Rice et al . , 2004; Topczewska et al . , 2016 ) . Under pathological/force conditions , mis-expression of splice forms can occur . Occasionally , Apert craniosynostosis syndrome is caused by heterozygous Alu-insertions or large deletions in the FGFR2c domain . These rare mutations induce abnormal expression of the FGFR2b splice form alongside FGFR2c splice form in mesenchymal cells . This permits cells to respond to both b- and c-activating FGF ligands including FGF10 ( Bochukova et al . , 2009; Oldridge et al . , 1999 ) . Analyzing the MAPK pathway in Rab23-/- lambdoid sutures we show that p38 signaling is decreased and pERK1/2 increased . FGFR activation of pERK1/2 is important for several stages of osteoblastogenesis , including osteoprogenitor proliferation , and in the induction and stabilization of RUNX2 ( Choi et al . , 2008; Yoon et al . , 2014 ) . Augmentation of pERK1/2 signaling either through overactivation of FGFRs , downregulation of its inhibitors , or downregulation of ERF that regulates the export of pERK from the nucleus , all result in craniosynostosis ( Lee et al . , 2018a; Lee et al . , 2018b; Timberlake et al . , 2017; Twigg et al . , 2013 ) . Although RUNX2 is a substrate for both p38 and pERK1/2 , pERK1/2 can activate RUNX2 on average six times more efficiently than p38 ( Ge et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , ERK1/2 binding to RUNX2 through MAPK D site has greater affinity than p38 binding and more sensitive to osteoblast differentiation during calvaria explant or primary osteoblast culture ( Franceschi and Ge , 2017; Ge et al . , 2012 ) . The importance of pERK1/2 regulation of RUNX2 during osteogenesis is shown in this study by the reversal of the craniosynostotic phenotype in Rab23-/- mice . p38 has been implicated in the skull phenotypes of craniosynostotic mice where it may regulate the development and growth of cartilage elements ( Wang et al . , 2010; Wang et al . , 2012 ) . Opposing roles of MAPK pathway subtypes p38 and pERK1/2 in cartilage development are well documented ( Ma et al . , 2019; Oh et al . , 2000; Stanton et al . , 2003 ) . Commonality of etiological mechanisms is suggested by the overlapping skeletal phenotypes exhibited in Carpenter syndrome and Grieg cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome patients as well as their mouse disease models , Gli3Xt−J/Xt−J ( Rice et al . , 2010 ) and Rab23-/- ( this study ) . Specifically , postaxial polydactyly in the forelimb , preaxial polydactyly in the hindlimb and lambdoid and interfrontal suture craniosynostosis ( Eggenschwiler et al . , 2001; Jenkins et al . , 2007; Kalff-Suske et al . , 1999; Vortkamp et al . , 1991 ) . Collectively suggest that craniosynostosis and polysyndactyly are overlapping phenotypes of aberrant FGF and Hh signaling . Aberrant osteogenesis and suture obliteration in the Gli3Xt−J/Xt−J mouse is caused by concomitant derepression of GLI3 and augmentation of IHH which activates the osteogenic master regulatory transcription factor RUNX2 ( Veistinen et al . , 2017 ) . Analysis of early Rab23-/- embryos suggests that RAB23 also has a role in promoting the production of GLI3 repressor ( Eggenschwiler et al . , 2006 ) . In both Gli3Xt−J/Xt−J and Rab23-/- calvaria elevated Hh signaling results in an upregulation of the transcription factor Gli1 , and presumably the mesenchymal stem niche which it labels . Previously , we have shown that FGF10 upregulates Hh and its receptor Patch1 during facial development ( Rice et al . , 2004 ) . Here , we show FGF10 upregulates Runx2 . Our study revealed that inhibition of pERK1/2 prevented Rab23-/- lambdoid suture fusion by decreasing osteoprogenitor proliferation and GLI1 expression ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . We further showed that combined and individual inhibition of GLI1 and pERK1/2 in Rab23-/- calvarial cells downregulated RUNX2 and GLI1 ( Figure 6 ) and that this effect was exaggerated in Rab23-/- cells . Phenotypic analyses of compound Rab23;Smoothened early embryonic mice shows that RAB23 can regulate GLI independently of Smoothened ( Eggenschwiler et al . , 2006 ) , and the regulation of GLI1 by pERK1/2 suggests a mechanism how this might occur ( Figure 7 ) . Non-canonical regulation GLI1 through tyrosine kinase activity has been documented during carcinogenesis , with activation of GLI1 promoting stemness through an increase in transcriptional activity , nuclear localization or protein stability ( Pietrobono et al . , 2019 ) . However , the non-canonical repression of GLI1 has not been well described in a developmental context . We show that RAB23 represses both FGF and Hh/GLI signaling ( Figure 7 ) . RAB23 coordinates suture morphogenesis and controls suture patency through three mechanisms: FGF10-pERK1/2 signaling , the repression of Hh targets through a canonical pathway , and through the repression of GLI1 by pERK1/2 . GLI1 contributes in the regulation of the mesenchymal stem cell niche . FGF10-pERK1/2 and also Hh-GLI1 signaling regulate osteoprogenitor cell proliferation . 
 Animal experiments were approved by the University of Helsinki , Helsinki University Hospital and the Southern Finland Council Animal Welfare and Ethics committees . Permit ESAVI/11956/04 . 10 . 07/2017 ( external ) and KEK17-008 ( internal ) . Rab23opb2/opb2 ( Rab23-/- ) mice were originally in C3Heb/Fej background were crossed into C57Bl/6J mouse strain ( Charles River ) for six or more generations with speed congenic method . The animals for breeding were selectively based on highest amount of C57 SNP markers ( Illumina mouse chip array ) to speed up strain change . After four generations more than 89% of SNPs were on C57 . The genotype of all mouse and embryos were verified with PCR-based genotyping as previously described ( Eggenschwiler and Anderson , 2000; Kasarskis et al . , 1998 ) . Analysis of the RNA expression was performed using Illuminan Mouse WG-6v2 microchips . RNA was isolated from E15 calvaria from Rab23-/- embryos and Wt littermates using Machrey-Nagel Nucleospin RNA II isolation kit . Labeling and chip run were performed by the Technology Centre , Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland ( FIMM ) , University of Helsinki . The data analysis and normalization was performed using Chipster 3 . 16 . 0 . Fold change of genes is calculated by arithmetic mean in linear scale and shown in the volcano plot . Fold change >1 ( up-regulated gene ) , fold change < 1 ( down-regulated gene ) . The microarray dataset has been deposited in MIAME-compliant GEO public database as source data . Accession number: GEO accession GSE140884 . For quantitative PCR , RNA was isolated individually from whole calvaria and from lambdoid suture of Rab23-/- and Wt embryos at E15 . 5 . 1 µg of RNA from calvarial ( n = 3+3 ) and 500 ng of RNA from lambdoid suture ( n = 8+8 ) were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primer and RevertAid reverse transcriptase ( Thermo scientific ) . 2 µl of diluted cDNA and Brilliant III ultra-fast SYBR-green qPCR master mix with QuantiTect Primers ( Qiagen ) . We performed the experiments as previously described ( Sanz-Navarro et al . , 2019 ) . In single-gene in situ RNAscope transcripts appear in red . A customized 20ZZ probe named Mm-Rab23 targeting 45–1330 of NM_008999 . 4 was purchased from Advanced Cell Diagnostics to perform Rab23 expression analysis on mouse calvarial suture . Images were obtained using a bright field microscope ( BX61 , Olympus ) . In situ hybridizations on whole embryonic samples was performed using digoxigenin-UTP labeled Rab23 probe and Pitx2 probe according to the protocol and modification described ( Kim et al . , 1998 ) . Immunohistochemistry on lambdoid sutural samples was performed using primary anti-RAB23 , GLI1 , RUNX2 and FGFR1 antibody . After incubation with HRP conjugated or alexa fluor conjugated secondary antibody Enzmet detection kit was used for GLI1 and FGFR1 detection and alexa fluor conjugated 488 , 546 secondary antibody was used to detect RAB23 and RUNX2 signals . The samples were permeabilized by triton X-100 and antigen retrieval was performed by citrate buffer . All the other procedure was followed according to the protocol described ( Veistinen et al . , 2017 ) . WT and Rab23-/- embryos were taken out at E15 . 5 embryonic day . We and others have previously described the procedure of calvarial primary cells isolation ( Rodan and Noda , 1991; Veistinen et al . , 2017 ) . Cells were cultured in DMEM containing high glucose and supplemented with 10% FBS , glutamine , penicillin and streptomycin , maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 . After maintaining the isolated cells in growth medium next passage is always used for experiments . E15 . 5 Wt calvaria derived mesenchymal cells were treated with exogenous FGF10 ( 250 ng/ml ) for 3 hr . Fgfr1b and Fgfr2b mRNA expression were then assessed by RT-qPCR . E15 . 5 Rab23-/- calvaria derived mesenchymal cells were treated with exogenous FGF10 ( 500 ng/ml ) for 2 and 4 hr . Runx2 mRNA expression were then assessed by RT-qPCR . RIPA buffer containing 1% SDS together with protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor were used to lyse the lambdoid sutural tissue on ice . After brief sonication ( 10 s , twice ) , tissue lysates were centrifuged at full speed for 10 min to collect the protein supernatant . By using BCA protein assay kit , protein concentrations were measured for immunoblotting analysis . Equal amount of proteins from wild type and RAB23 deficient cells were subjected to prepare to separate on SDS-PAGE under reduced gel electrophoresis ( 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Gels , Bio-Rad ) . After transferring to nitrocellulose membrane , membranes were blocked by odyssey blocking buffer at room temperature for 3 hr . Membranes were then incubated with corresponding primary anti-RAB23 , anti-p38 , anti-phospho-p38 , anti-ERK , anti-pERK , anti-RUNX2 , anti-pSMAD1/5/8 , anti-GLI1 , anti-FGFR1 and anti-Tubulin antibodies and kept overnight at 4°C . Fluorophore-conjugated corresponding IRdye goat anti-rabbit 680LT or CW800 or anti-mouse 800CW secondary antibodies were used at room temperature for 1 hr . α-Tubulin was used to normalize protein expressions . In vitro inhibition of pERK1/2 in Rab23-/- calvaria derived primary cells ( E15 . 5 ) was performed by adding 5 µM of U0126 and 10 µM of cyclopamine for 6 , 24 and 48 hr . Membranes were scanned using an Odyssey infrared imaging system ( Odyssey; LI-COR Biosciences , model 9120 ) . Band intensity was determined using ImageJ ( NIH ) software . After removing skin and underneath brain calvaria from E18 . 5 Wt and Rab23-/- were cultured in an in vitro explant culture system . The calvaria was kept on top of the filter laid on metallic grid . The calvaria sample was supplemented with DMEM containing 10% FBS , dexamethasone , ascorbic acid and β-glyceraldehyde . Rab23-/- calvaria received 5 µM of U0126 treatment or DMSO as control . After 48 hr fresh medium and inhibitors were added . After 48 or 72 hr , samples were fixed with 4% PFA for subsequent analysis . For immediate calvarial bone and suture recognition vital bone dye calcein green was injected to mother mouse 1 day before the E17 . 5 or E18 . 5 embryo collection . Subsequent imaging in the culture was performed after alizarin red incorporation in the medium . Images were taken by Olympus SZX12 fluorescent microscope . The Alcian blue-Alizarin red staining of E18 . 5 specimens was performed as previously described ( Rice et al . , 2003a ) . For analysis of calvarial bone and sutures images were captured using Analysis software ( Soft Imaging System ) and Olympus BX41 microscope and analyzed in Adobe Photoshop CS4 . Mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) were isolated from E13 . 5 embryos ( noon of the vaginal plug detection day was considered E0 . 5 ) . Briefly , embryos were collected to sterile PBS . The head , liver and spleen were removed and used for histology , RNA isolation or for genotyping . The remaining tissue was cut into smaller pieces and dissociated with gentle pipetting in 0 . 25% Trypsin-EDTA solution . After 10 min incubation , any larger tissue pieces were discarded and remaining cell suspension was plated with rich MEF medium into two T25 flasks per embryo . The medium was changed daily until first passaging at confluency . The growth medium was DMEM , High Glucose , GlutaMAX ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10% FBS , 1x non-essential amino acids ( Gibco ) , 20 mM Hepes pH 7 . 3 and 1x penicillin-streptomycin . The cells were subcultured when 90% confluent to 750 , 000 live cells/T75 flask and only passages 1–6 ( active division ) were used for EdU pulsed proliferation analyses . The cell density and viability was assessed with Trypan Blue and Countess automated cell counter ( Invitrogen ) . Cell proliferation was assessed by prior EdU incorporation followed by EdU click reaction . The MEF cell lines were pulsed for 1 hr with 10 µM EdU ( Molecular probes , Invitrogen ) in DMSO dissolved to pre-warmed medium before distribution to cells for 1 hr EdU pulse and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde . The EdU was detected with Click-iT EdU imaging kit , Alexa fluor 594 ( Molecular probes , Invitrogen ) according to manufacturer's instruction . The number of EdU positive cells was counted from three separate experiments from a minimum five different locations per cell line and compared to total cell number determined with Hoechst 33342 staining of nuclei . The mice were pulsed with 0 . 05 mg/g ( i . p . ) EdU in PBS 2 hr collection of tissue . After sacrificing E17 . 5 embryonic lambdoid sutures were collected and fixed o/n with 4% paraformaldehyde , and processed for paraffin sections . Paraffin-embedded lambdoid sutures were sectioned 7 µm size . The sections were deparaffinized and stained with same Click-iT kit . EdU click reaction procedure in brief , sectional explants were deparaffinized by xylene and rehydrated by a gradient of ethanol series . After washing with 2 mg/ml glycine , sutural sections were permeabilized with 0 . 5% Triton X-100 . After several washing in PBS , 10 µM EdU cocktail was used for click reaction for 30 min at dark room . After several PBS washing 5 µg/ml Hoechst was used for counter staining . Vectashield mounting medium was used to mount the slides . Slides were then imaged with fluorescence microscope with emission wavelength 615 nm . Cell counting: Cluster of proliferating cells ( red cell ) considered as osteogenic front . The middle of the scale was kept on the tip of each osteogenic front and then rest of the part was flanked towards the suture . The length of the scale is 145 µm and width 61 µm . Cells from skin , dura mater and cartilage were not included in counting . Apoptotic assay on tissue sections from in vitro cultured Wt , control Rab23-/- and U0126 treated Rab23-/- lambdoid suture was performed according to manufacturer protocol ( In situ apoptosis detection kit AB206386 ) . E18 . 5 WT and Rab23-/- whole head and samples from rescue studies were collected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight . Samples were dehydrated by gradient ethanol series to 70% ( v/v ) , followed by processed for x-ray microtomography ( µCT ) imaging with Bruker SkyScan1272 ( desktop micro-CT system , Bruker microCT N .

96,"This text describes experimental procedures, including microscopic techniques employed. Although there aren 'the detailed methodologies involved therein remain outside scope  and hence cannot serve purpose intended primarily towards understanding mechanisms underlying epigenic memories associated particularly WITH THIS study involving modulation OF transcript activity via alterations made upon establishment AND maintenance Of particular spatial arrangements - NOT THE STUDY organism behavior – thus limitations inherent TO THAT technique ARE discussed LATER IN detail elsewhere -.","Genetic material is contained within molecules of DNA . In plants and many other organisms , these DNA molecules are packaged around proteins called histones to make a structure known as chromatin . Altering how the DNA is packaged in chromatin can control the activity of genes . For example , a group of proteins called the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 ( PRC2 ) adds methyl tags to histones , which can alter the packaging of chromatin to lower the activity of particular genes . When a cell divides , it is sometimes important that genes in the daughter cells have similar levels of activity as the parent cell . This allows individual cells to ‘remember’ past events , such as exposure to cold temperatures or other environmental conditions . The pattern of methyl tags on histones can be passed onto the daughter cells , but it is not clear if this is actually responsible for providing the memory . One gene that PRC2 regulates is called FLC , which influences when a plant called Arabidopsis produces flowers . If the plants are exposed to cold temperatures , the activity of FLC is repressed . FLC activity remains low after the period of cold has ended to ensure that the plants produce flowers at an appropriate time . If this 'memory of cold' is held locally in the chromatin of the FLC gene , then it should be possible for two copies of the FLC gene in the same cell to show different gene activities . However , if the memory is stored more globally inside each cell by other proteins , then the two copies should have identical gene activities . To distinguish between these two possibilities , Berry et al . added different fluorescent tags to two copies of the FLC gene in Arabidopsis plants , which allowed the activity of each gene copy to be tracked in individual cells under a microscope . The experiments show that one copy of FLC may be switched off , while the other remains switched on inside the same cell . Furthermore , it was found that this pattern of gene activity is passed onto the daughter cells when the original cell divides . Berry et al . 's findings show that the memory of FLC gene activity is stored locally in the chromatin of the FLC gene itself . The alteration of histones by PRC2 is one important aspect of the packaging of chromatin . The next challenge is to identify what other features of chromatin are required for a gene to be able to store this memory locally .","Inheritance of gene expression states is fundamental for cells to ‘remember’ past events , such as environmental or developmental cues . The conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 ( PRC2 ) maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants and modifies chromatin at its targets . Histones modified by PRC2 can be inherited through cell division . However , it remains unclear whether this inheritance can direct long-term memory of individual gene expression states ( cis memory ) or instead if local chromatin states are dictated by the concentrations of diffusible factors ( trans memory ) . By monitoring the expression of two copies of the Arabidopsis Polycomb target gene FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) in the same plants , we show that one copy can be repressed while the other is active . Furthermore , this ‘mixed’ expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as plants develop . These data demonstrate that epigenetic memory of FLC expression is stored not in trans but in cis . 
 Epigenetic memory can be stored in the concentrations of diffusible regulatory factors that are maintained through feedback loops ( trans memory ) ( Novick and Weiner , 1957; Ptashne , 2004; Zacharioudakis et al . , 2007 ; Xu et al . , 2009 ) . Alternatively , memory could be stored locally in the chromatin environment of individual genes ( cis memory ) , in the form of DNA methylation or post-translational modifications of histones ( Moazed , 2011 ) . While in both trans and cis memory the chromatin state is inherited , in the former case chromatin responds to the transcriptional state defined by heritable concentrations of the trans-factors , whereas in the latter case it is the local chromatin environment that instructs its own inheritance and is , therefore , the key epigenetic memory element . Whether heritable information can be stored in patterns of histone modifications is a subject of much debate ( Ptashne , 2007; Kaufman and Rando , 2010; Henikoff and Shilatifard , 2011; Petruk et al . , 2012; Gaydos et al . , 2014 ) . Central to this debate is Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) , a key transcriptional regulator in animals and plants . PRC2 catalyses methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 ( H3K27me ) ( Cao et al . , 2002 ) and mutagenesis experiments have shown that K27 is necessary for PRC2-mediated repression ( Pengelly et al . , 2013 ) . DNA replication poses a significant challenge to histone-modification based memory as patterns of modifications must be faithfully transmitted to daughter DNA strands ( Steffen and Ringrose , 2014 ) . During replication , maternal histones are shared between daughter chromosomes where they re-associate close to their original location ( Radman-Livaja et al . , 2011; Annunziato , 2005 ) . Since PRC2 has affinity for H3K27me3 , it has been proposed that H3K27me3 on inherited histones could recruit PRC2 to daughter DNA strands in order to similarly modify newly incorporated , unmodified histones ( Margueron et al . , 2009 ) . Supporting the hypothesis that modified histones are indeed the key inherited cis memory element , it was recently observed that passage of H3K27-methylated histones to daughter chromosomes can occur in the absence of functional PRC2 ( Gaydos et al . , 2014 ) . Other studies have suggested that Polycomb proteins themselves are maintained locally through DNA replication ( Petruk et al . , 2012; Francis et al . , 2009 ) . These studies provide valuable mechanistic information about how a Polycomb system could store the memory of transcriptional states of individual genes in cis . However , to definitively demonstrate that memory is stored in cis , it is necessary to show that two copies of the same DNA sequence can be independently maintained in different transcriptional states in the same nucleus ( Bonasio et al . , 2010 ) . This has been observed in genomic imprinting and in random X-chromosome inactivation . Since imprinting involves DNA methylation ( Ferguson-Smith , 2011 ) , and X-chromosome inactivation involves chromosome-wide changes in chromatin structure and nuclear positioning ( Gendrel et al . , 2014 ) , it remains an open question whether Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can store epigenetic memory . Cis memory has also been implicated in random monoallelic expression . However , studies so far have been limited to genes with naturally occurring genetic polymorphisms ( Eckersley-Maslin et al . , 2014; Deng et al . , 2014 ) or are performed on fixed tissues limiting conclusions regarding heritability ( Gendrel et al . , 2014 ) . Importantly , a requirement for chromatin-modifying factors in epigenetic memory does not necessarily imply that memory is itself stored in chromatin . To address the question of whether Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can instruct its own inheritance and therefore constitutes a cis memory system , we exploited the classic epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis . Vernalization is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure and is mediated by cold-induced epigenetic repression of the Polycomb target gene and floral repressor FLC . FLC repression requires PRC2 but is independent of DNA methylation ( Finnegan et al . , 2005 ) , making it a useful system for studying the cis-memory storage capability of Polycomb at a single gene . In vernalized plants , FLC expression is bistable , with the number of cells in which FLC is stably repressed increasing quantitatively with the duration of prior cold exposure ( Angel et al . , 2011 ) . Cold exposure results in localization of a plant-homeodomain-PRC2 complex ( PHD-PRC2 ) to a small nucleation region within the FLC gene , which leads to locally increased H3K27me3 and co-ordinately decreased H3K36me3 ( Angel et al . , 2011; De Lucia et al . , 2008; Finnegan and Dennis , 2007; Yang et al . , 2014 ) . On return to warm , the PHD-PRC2 complex spreads across the gene leading to high H3K27me3 over the whole locus and stable repression ( Angel et al . , 2011; De Lucia et al . , 2008 ) . After cold , H3K27me3 is present at the FLC promoter and gene body but does not spread to neighbouring genes ( Angel et al . , 2011; Finnegan and Dennis , 2007; Yang et al . , 2014 ) . Polycomb-dependent FLC repression is maintained throughout plant development until it is reset during embryogenesis ( Gendall et al . , 2001; Crevillen et al . , 2014 ) . If FLC transcriptional states are defined by concentrations of diffusible factors ( trans memory ) , then all copies of FLC within a cell should be in the same transcriptional state . On the other hand , if FLC chromatin states instruct their own inheritance ( cis memory ) , then it should be possible for different copies of FLC within a cell to exist in different heritable transcriptional states . 
 To search for evidence of this ‘mixed’ transcriptional state , we generated a system in which we could visualize the expression of two copies of FLC in single cells . We generated plants expressing FLC tagged with either Venus or mCherry fluorescent protein in the FRI-sf2 flc-2 genetic background ( Michaels et al . , 1999 ) . The transgenes consist of 12 kb of genomic DNA surrounding FLC with the Venus or mCherry sequence inserted as a translational fusion into FLC exon 6 ( Figure 1A ) . The early flowering phenotype of flc-2 mutants was fully rescued in transgenic lines , demonstrating that the fusion proteins are functional ( Figure 1B , C ) . Expression of full-length FLC-Venus fusion protein was confirmed by immunoprecipitation , followed by immunoblot and mass spectrometry ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Like wild-type Columbia line FRI-sf2 ( Col-FRI ) , FLC-Venus and FLC-mCherry plants responded to cold exposure by accelerating flowering ( Figure 1C ) . This indicates that the FLC transgenes were stably repressed similarly to endogenous FLC after cold . Epigenetic repression was confirmed to be quantitatively dependent on the duration of cold exposure for FLC-Venus at the transcriptional level in both roots and shoots , and also at the protein level ( Figure 2A , Figure 2–figure supplement 1 ) . We also verified that the FLC antisense transcripts , named COOLAIR ( Swiezewski et al . , 2009; Csorba et al . , 2014 ) , are expressed from these constructs and are induced during cold exposure ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07205 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07205 . 011 FLC-Venus and FLC-mCherry were visualized using confocal microscopy of root meristems in warm conditions 7 days after cold exposures ranging from 2 to 10 weeks . Roots provide an excellent system for studying heritability of epigenetic states because cell lineages are visible as continuous files of cells that arise from repeated anticlinal divisions along the longitudinal axis of the growing root ( Dolan et al . , 1993 ) ( Figure 2B ) . In warm conditions , stem cells at the root tip divide approximately once every two days , while for other meristematic cells this occurs approximately once per day ( Campilho et al . , 2006 ) . Each cell undergoes several divisions before reaching the elongation zone whereupon cell division no longer takes place and cells begin endoreduplication . Therefore , 7 days after plants are transferred from cold , a single cell in the stem cell niche will have given rise to a lineage that encompasses a long file of cells in the root meristem . These files allow a direct assay of the mitotic stability of the epigenetic state in vivo . Strikingly , images of FLC-Venus and FLC-mCherry 7 days after cold exposure showed long files of cells in the same expression state ( Figure 2C , Figure 2—figure supplement 3 , Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) , demonstrating the long-term mitotic stability of the active and repressed transcriptional states . Such files make it implausible that the observed expression levels in single cells are the result of transcriptional noise . To quantitatively characterize the FLC-Venus expression status in individual cells after different durations of cold , we developed an automated image analysis procedure to calculate the mean FLC-Venus intensity inside each cell ( ‘Materials and methods’ and Figure 2—figure supplement 5 , Figure 2—figure supplement 6 ) . As suggested by individual images , our unbiased analysis of 53 roots ( 8547 reconstructed cells ) revealed that the number of cells expressing FLC-Venus decreased quantitatively with the duration of cold exposure ( Figure 2C , D ) . Importantly , FLC-Venus expression was bimodal after 6 or 8 weeks cold , and almost all cells were silenced after 10 weeks cold ( Figure 2D ) . Having developed an assay to visualize mitotic heritability of FLC expression states at the single-cell level , we returned to the question of cis vs trans epigenetic memory at FLC . We crossed FLC-mCherry to FLC-Venus plants to generate F1 hybrids carrying a single copy of each transgene . In a trans-based memory , the only possible heritable expression states of FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry are ON/ON and OFF/OFF , because epigenetic information is stored as a diffusible signal ( Figure 3A ) . In a cis-based memory , all four states ON/ON , ON/OFF , OFF/ON , and OFF/OFF are possible because the information is stored at the locus itself ( Figure 3B ) . As expected , non-vernalized roots showed uniform ON/ON expression of both transgenes in all cells ( Figure 3C , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . To stochastically induce repression of the two FLC transgenes , we exposed F1 plants to 4–6 weeks of cold followed by 7 days growth in warm . Strikingly , we observed long files of cells in which one FLC reporter was stably repressed , while the other remained stably activated ( Figure 3D ) . In fact , we observed long-term mitotic stability of all four possible combinations: FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry ON/ON , ON/OFF , OFF/ON , and OFF/OFF ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Inheritance of the ‘mixed’ ON/OFF and OFF/ON states directly contradicts trans memory and instead provides direct evidence of a cis-encoded epigenetic state at FLC . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07205 . 012Figure 3 . ‘Mixed’ transcriptional states are mitotically inherited . ( A ) In a trans memory system , the two copies of FLC are coordinately regulated and only two mitotically heritable states are possible ( FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry ON/ON , OFF/OFF ) . ( B ) In a cis memory system , the two copies of FLC can be maintained in alternative expression states , so four mitotically heritable states are possible ( FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry ON/ON , ON/OFF , OFF/ON , OFF/OFF ) . ( C ) Non-vernalized roots of FLC-mCherry × FLC-Venus F1 plants show uniform expression of FLC-Venus and FLC-mCherry in all nuclei . ( D ) After vernalization such plants can epigenetically repress a single-gene copy , while the other remains activated .

However , like endogenous FLC , the reporters are actively expressed throughout development in warm conditions and epigenetically repressed specifically in response to prolonged cold ( Figures 1–3 , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 , Figure 2—figure supplement 3 , Figure 2—figure supplement 4 , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 , Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Epigenetic repression , therefore , depends on cold exposure and the FLC-specific sequences within the transgenes rather than the genomic location . Furthermore , since we observe similar numbers of cells in the FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry ON/OFF and OFF/ON expression states ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) , we consider it unlikely that differences in genomic location or fluorophore sequence between the transgenes causes one of the copies to be preferentially repressed over the other . Our findings demonstrate that the molecular changes to the chromatin environment of FLC induced by prolonged cold exposure are sufficient to instruct epigenetic inheritance of the Polycomb-repressed transcriptional state . However , Polycomb complex binding and H3K27me may not be the only factors that constitute this locally encoded epigenetic state . Specific nucleic acid structures ( Klose et al . , 2013 ) , non-coding RNAs ( Herzog et al . , 2014 ) ( for example the chromatin-associated COOLAIR antisense transcripts at FLC ( Csorba et al . , 2014 ) ) , and histone variants ( Jacob et al . , 2014 ) may also play important roles . Thus , not all H3K27-methylated chromatin should be considered as epigenetically silent . What defines a local chromatin environment as sufficient to confer cis-based epigenetic memory is now a central question in this field . Our methodology of using two reporters to specifically distinguish cis vs trans memory is broadly applicable and should be helpful in this pursuit . 
 Plant growth conditions were described previously ( De Lucia et al . , 2008 ) . For expression analysis and protein extraction , plants were grown on Murashige and Skoog ( MS ) agar plates without glucose . For flowering time measurements , plants were transferred from plates to soil 5 days after vernalization . For microscopy , plants were grown almost vertically on MS plates supplemented with 1% ( wt/vol ) sucrose and 0 . 5% ( wt/vol ) Phytagel ( Sigma–Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , P8169 ) . Col-FRI is Col-0 with an introgressed active FRIGIDA allele ( FRI-sf2 ) , and was previously described ( Lee et al . , 1994 ) , as was the flc-2 mutant in Col-FRI ( Michaels et al . , 1999 ) . FLC-Venus and FLC-mCherry translational fusions were generated in a similar way to a previously published FLC-GUS reporter ( Bastow et al . , 2004 ) . Specifically , either the Venus ( Nagai et al . , 2002 ) or mCherry ( Shaner et al . , 2004 ) coding sequence was inserted into the NheI site of FLC exon 6 . The resultant 12 . 7-kb SacI/XhoI genomic fragments were transferred into pSLJ-755I6 ( Jones et al . , 1992 ) for transformation into flc-2 FRI-sf2 plants using Agrobacterium tumefaciens . Many ( >30 ) independent transgenic lines that we analysed rescued the early-flowering phenotype of parental flc-2 FRI-sf2 plants and showed accelerated flowering in response to cold exposure . Transgenic FLC lines were selected for further analysis based on similarity between expression level of the transgene and that of endogenous FLC . Lines containing a single-copy transgene were identified using a qPCR-based assay adapted for Arabidopsis from a previously described method ( Bartlett et al . , 2008 ) ( performed by IDna Genetics , UK ) . Primer and probe sequences are listed here: Bar-F: ggccgagtcgaccgtgta; Bar-R: ttgggcagcccgatga; Bar-Probe: FAM-cgccaccagcggacggga-TAMRA; AtCO-F: gtccgggtctgcgagtca; AtCO-R: gctgtgcatagagaggcatcatc; AtCO-Probe: VIC-tgctccggctgcttttttgtgtgag-TAMRA . Single-copy FLC-Venus and FLC-mCherry lines showed no evidence of transgene silencing in 3 generations of propagation after transformation . Total RNA was prepared as previously described ( Etheridge et al . , 1999 ) , except on a smaller scale . When measuring unspliced FLC , genomic DNA was removed using TURBO DNA-free ( Ambion , Austin , TX , AM1907 ) following the manufacturer's guidelines , except that phenol–chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation were used to further purify RNA after DNAse treatment . Reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis System ( Invitrogen , Austin , TX , 18080-051 ) , according to the manufacturer's protocol using either gene-specific primers or Oligo ( dT ) 12-18 ( Invitrogen , 18418-012 ) . COOLAIR isoforms were measured as previously described ( Csorba et al . , 2014 ) . qPCR was performed using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master ( Roche , UK , 04887352001 ) on the LightCycler 480 instrument ( Roche ) . Threshold cycle ( Ct ) values were calculated using the ‘Second Derivative Maximum method’ in the LightCycler software . RNA levels relative to UBC ( At5g25760 ) ( Czechowski et al . , 2005 ) were determined using the ΔΔCt method ( Livak and Schmittgen , 2001 ) . Primer and probe sequences are listed here: UBC ( At5g25760 , forward spans exon 3/exon 4 , reverse in exon 4 ) UBCspl_F: ctgcgactcagggaatcttctaa; UBCspl_R: ttgtgccattgaattgaaccc; spliced FLC ( forward spans exon 4/exon 5 , reverse in exon 7 ) FLCspl_F: agccaagaagaccgaactca; FLCspl_R: tttgtccagcaggtgacatc; unspliced FLC ( forward in intron 2 , reverse in intron 3 ) FLC_3966_F: cgcaattttcatagcccttg; FLC_4135_R: ctttgtaatcaaaggtggagagc; FLC-Venus ( forward in Venus coding sequence , reverse in FLC exon 7 ) FLC-VENUSex6_cDNA_1247_F: cacatggtcctgctggagtt; FLC-VENUSex6_cDNA_1388_R: cggagatttgtccagcaggt; Total COOLAIR ( both primers in exon 1 ) Set6new_LP: tgtatgtgttcttcacttctgtcaa; Set6new_RP: gccgtaggcttcttcactgt; Class I COOLAIR ( forward spans exon 1/exon 2 , reverse in exon 2 ) Set2new_LP: tcatcatgtgggagcagaag; Set2new_RP: tctcacacgaataaggtggcta; Class II COOLAIR ( reverse transcription primer and both qPCR primers in distal exon ) Set4_RT: aatatctggcccgacgaag; Set4new_F-195: gtatctccggcgacttgaac; Set4new_R-195: ggatgcgtcacagagaacag . FLC-Venus or untransformed control plants were ground in liquid nitrogen and suspended in extraction buffer ( 20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 5% ( wt/vol ) Triton X-100 , 10% ( wt/vol ) glycerol , cOmplete protease inhibitor EDTA-free [Roche , 04693159001] ) . After 10 min incubation with gentle rotation at 4°C , samples were cleared by repeated centrifugation at 20 , 000 × g , 4°C . Venus-tagged protein was precipitated by incubating soluble extract with GFP-Trap_M beads ( Chromotek , Germany , gtm-20 ) . Magnetic beads were washed three times with a mild wash buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM MgCl2 ) . Proteins were eluted by denaturation using sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) , separated on polyacrylamide gels and either transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for analysis by immunoblotting or excised from gels for mass spectrometry . Liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis was performed using a LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher , UK ) and a nanoflow-HPLC system ( Surveyor; Thermo Fisher ) , as previously described ( De Lucia et al . , 2008 ) . MS data were analysed using Scaffold 4 ( Proteome Software , Portland , OR ) . Whole seedlings were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen and incubated for 10 min in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 100 mM NaCl , 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) , 1% ( wt/vol ) SDS , 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol , cOmplete protease inhibitor EDTA-free [Roche , 04693159001] ) . After clearing by centrifugation at 20 , 000 × g , 4°C , proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Hybond ECL; GE Healthcare , UK ) . Venus-tagged protein was detected with either a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody ( Abcam , UK , ab290 ) or a commercial mouse monoclonal anti-GFP antibody mixture ( Roche , 11814460001 ) . Signals were visualized by chemiluminescence ( SuperSignal West Femto; Pierce , Austin , TX ) using secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase ( anti-mouse , Santa Cruz Biotechnologies , Dallas , TX; anti-rabbit , GE Healthcare ) . Membranes were reversibly stained using Ponceau S solution ( Sigma–Aldrich , P7170 ) . Confocal microscopy data were obtained for homozygous single-copy FLC-Venus and FLC-mCherry lines at the T3 generation or F1 plants generated by crossing these lines . Imaging was performed using a 20×/0 . 7 NA multi-immersion lens , with water as the immersion fluid on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope equipped with Leica HyD Hybrid detectors . For z-stacks , the step size was 3 μm , which meant that each nucleus was typically observed in 2–3 consecutive confocal z-slices . For single-fluorophore experiments with FLC-Venus lines , roots were immersed in 2 μg/mL propidium iodide ( Sigma–Aldrich , P4864 ) to label the cell wall . The emission spectrum of propidium iodide overlaps with that of mCherry , so could not be used in FLC-mCherry or double-fluorophore experiments . The following wavelengths were used for fluorescence detection: FLC-Venus excitation 514 nm and detection 511–555 nm ( with 514-nm notch filter ) , propidium iodide excitation 514 nm and detection 626–697 nm , FLC-mCherry excitation 561 nm and detection 570–620 nm . To allow comparison between treatments , the same laser power and detector settings were used for all FLC-Venus images and all FLC-mCherry images , respectively . For double-fluorophore experiments , Venus and mCherry fluorophores were simultaneously excited at 514 nm and 561 nm , respectively . The following steps were used to prepare images for presentation: raw confocal z-stacks were aligned using the MultiStackReg plugin in Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . To reduce detector noise , a Gaussian blur with a 1 . 5-pixel radius was then applied to images measuring 2048 × 1024 pixels ( 510 × 255 μm ) , before taking maximum intensity projections over 2–4 z-planes ( 6–12 μm ) . Finally , the intensity was linearly adjusted separately for each channel . For visual comparison of nuclear intensity between different treatments in FLC-Venus images , the same linear adjustment was used . Confocal z-stack images were analysed using a custom image processing pipeline to reconstruct cellular volumes and calculate the mean FLC-Venus fluorescence intensity per cell . The pipeline is described below and summarized in Figure 2—figure supplement 5 . The source code is available at https://github . com/JIC-CSB/root-image-analysis . Since the propidium iodide cell wall stain is not compatible for imaging with mCherry , cell segmentation could not be performed for FLC-mCherry or double-fluorophore experiments . Image analysis was , therefore , undertaken for FLC-Venus only . Pixels not corresponding to root tissue were masked using a series of morphological transforms of the propidium iodide ( cell wall ) images from each stack . To prepare the masked cell wall data for segmentation into individual cells , a Gaussian filter ( using a standard deviation of 2 pixels ) followed by median-based local thresholding ( using Fiji's Auto Local Threshold plugin and a radius of 40 pixels ) was applied to each plane of the stack . Each image was skeletonized using the Fiji Skeletonize plugin and then segmented using the Watershed plugin . Together , these steps generated an individual 2D segmentation for each cell wall image in the stack . The structure of the root was then reconstructed in 3D by comparing cells in segmented 2D images with those in neighbouring planes . Briefly , cells in 2D planes were considered part of the same 3D cell if the following two criteria were satisfied: first , their centroids were within a distance of 20 pixels from one another , and second , their relative areas did not vary by more than 50% . In addition to these criteria , the maximum extent of a single cell in the z-direction was limited to 18 μm ( 6 z-planes ) . This algorithm was implemented in Python ( http://www . python . org ) using the scikit-image library ( http://scikit-image . org/ ) . Finally , reconstructed 3D volumes were applied to the images from the FLC-Venus fluorescent channel to calculate mean intensity across the reconstructed volume by summing FLC-Venus intensity inside the reconstructed cell ( from multiple z-planes ) and dividing by the total volume of the reconstructed cell ( summed area from multiple z-planes ) . To validate the method , the mean FLC-Venus intensity per cell was estimated manually for a random selection of 50 cells from 22 different roots . Comparison of these results with those generated by the automated procedure for the same cells indicated that the mean cellular FLC-Venus intensities were accurate in approximately 80% of cells . The remaining cells in this test set were incorrectly segmented by the algorithm . Consecutive z-stack images were separated by 3 μm and each root typically contained 14–18 images , which encompassed approximately the top third of the root in the meristematic and elongation zones . It was observed that FLC-Venus intensity decreased with depth in the image stack ( Figure 2—figure supplement 5B ) . This effect may have arisen due to photobleaching as a greater depth also corresponded to a later image acquisition time . To reduce this effect , we restricted the analysis to those planes where the intensity was approximately constant . The number of roots analyzed and other statistics are shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 5C .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results and discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['chromosomes and gene expression', 'short report', 'plant biology']",elife-07205-v2,74,6350,6276,85.8108108108108

Each virus particle contains a single molecule called ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) , which is protected by hundreds of copies of a coat protein . The RNA and coat proteins are arranged in a helical fashion to make a flexible rod-shaped particle . The flexibility of these viruses makes it difficult to carry out in-depth studies of their three-dimensional structures . As a result , we do not know how the RNA and coat proteins interact to form the structure of each virus particle . Agirrezabala et al . used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy ( or cryoEM for short ) to generate a highly detailed three-dimensional model of a flexible filamentous virus called Pepino Mosaic Virus . Agirezabala et al . ’s findings reveal how the virus particles assemble , and the interactions between the coat protein and the ssRNA . Unexpectedly , the structure of the coat protein from Pepino Mosiac Virus is very similar to the structure of “nucleoproteins” from a group of viruses called the Phleboviruses , which infect animals . This similarity is striking and suggests that the gene that encodes these proteins has been transferred between the two groups of viruses during evolution . A future challenge is to find out whether this similarity extends to other groups of viruses .","Flexible filamentous viruses include economically important plant pathogens . Their viral particles contain several hundred copies of a helically arrayed coat protein ( CP ) protecting a ( + ) ssRNA . We describe here a structure at 3 . 9 Å resolution , from electron cryomicroscopy , of Pepino mosaic virus ( PepMV ) , a representative of the genus Potexvirus ( family Alphaflexiviridae ) . Our results allow modeling of the CP and its interactions with viral RNA . The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins ( NPs ) from the genus Phlebovirus ( family Bunyaviridae ) , a group of enveloped ( - ) ssRNA viruses . The main difference between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal extensions , which appear to determine the characteristics of the distinct multimeric assemblies – a flexuous , helical rod or a loose ribonucleoprotein . The homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic ( + ) and ( - ) ssRNA viruses . 
 Flexible filamentous viruses are ubiquitous plant pathogens that have an enormous impact in agriculture ( Revers and Garcia , 2015 ) . Their infective particles are non-enveloped and flexible rod-shaped virions ( Kendall et al . , 2008 ) and contain several hundreds of copies of a coat protein ( CP ) arranged in a helical fashion protecting a ssRNA of positive polarity , or ( + ) ssRNA ( Kendall et al . , 2008 ) . They are distributed in families Alphaflexiviridae , Betaflexiviridae , Closteroviridae , and Potyviridae , which have different genomic organizations ( particularly different between Potyviridae and the rest of the groups ) and belong to different superfamilies , but it is thought that their CPs have strong evolutionary relationships ( Koonin et al . , 2015 ) . Structural studies of virions by X-ray fiber diffraction and cryoEM have indeed revealed a common architecture for flexible plant viruses . The filaments are 120-130 Å in diameter , and the CPs are arranged following helical symmetry with slightly less than 9 subunits per turn ( Kendall et al . , 2008 ) . This overall arrangement is shared by Soybean mosaic virus ( SMV ) a potyvirus ( from the family Potyviridae ) , and three different potexviruses ( family Alphaflexiviridae ) , Potato virus X ( PVX ) , Papaya mosaic virus ( PapMV ) , and Narcissus mosaic virus ( NMV ) ( Kendall et al . , 2013 , Yang et al . , 2012 , Kendall et al . , 2008 ) . The flexibility of the virions has limited high-resolution structural studies , and most of the previous data were at moderate resolution . Very recently , the cryoEM structure of Bamboo mosaic virus ( BaMV ) , another potexvirus , was determined at 5 . 6 Å ( DiMaio et al . , 2015 ) , and the CP was modeled based on the atomic structure of a truncated version of the CP from Papaya mosaic virus ( PapMV CP ) ( Yang et al . , 2012 ) . The work revealed that N- and C-terminal extensions of the CP mediate viral polymerization and allow for the flexuous nature of the virions . Pepino mosaic virus ( PepMV ) is another potexvirus which has emerged recently ( Jones et al . , 1980 ) , progressing from endemic to epidemic in tomato crops causing severe economic losses worldwide ( Hanssen and Thomma , 2010 ) . PepMV is transmitted by mechanical contact and virions contain a ( + ) ssRNA of about 6 . 4 kb ( Aguilar et al . , 2002 ) . The PepMV CP is strictly required for cell-to-cell movement of the virus ( Sempere et al . , 2011 ) . We present the cryoEM structure of PepMV virions at 3 . 9 Å of resolution . The near-atomic three-dimensional ( 3D ) map allows for accurate modeling of the CP , the viral RNA , and their interaction . In vivo functional studies of several CP mutants confirm the role of several residues in RNA binding and polymerization . Surprisingly , we have also found a clear structural homology between the CP of flexuous viruses and the NP of the genus Phlebovirus , a group of enveloped viruses with a segmented ( - ) ssRNA genome . The NPs from phleboviruses are associated with the viral genome in loose ribonucleoproteins ( RNPs ) ( Raymond et al . , 2012 ) protected inside an envelope , in which inserted glycoproteins construct an icosahedral shell ( Huiskonen et al . , 2009 , Freiberg et al . , 2008 ) . Despite the divergence of both viral groups , CP from potexviruses and NP from phleboviruses have the same all α-helix fold , and their high similarity suggests a horizontal gene transfer event between these evolutionary distant groups of eukaryotic RNA viruses . 
 We have analyzed by cryoEM PepMV virions isolated from infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The 3D map at 3 . 9 Å of resolution ( Figures 1A , B and Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) was calculated by single particle-based helical image processing implemented in Spring software ( Desfosses et al . , 2014 ) . The cryoEM map reveals a left-handed helix with a diameter of 130 Å and an inner narrow channel of 13 Å , and the structure shows a pitch of 34 . 6 Å and 8 . 7 CP copies per turn . This overall helical arrangement is in agreement with previous works with other potexviruses ( Kendall et al . , 2013 , Yang et al . , 2012 ) , but in the current case and in the recent cryoEM structure of BaMV ( DiMaio et al . , 2015 ) the attained resolutions allowed a clear assignment of the symmetry . Our cryoEM map reaches near-atomic resolution , to date the highest resolution structural data for a flexible filamentous virion , where bulky protein side chains are discernible ( Figure 1C ) . This allowed us to generate an atomic model for PepMV CP ( Figure 1D ) by iterative modeling starting with the atomic structure of PapMV CP ( see 'Materials and methods' ) . The PepMV CP structure thus generated has three major regions: the core; an N-terminal flexible arm; and a C-terminal extension . The first 20 amino acids in the N-terminal side are not included in the atomic model because the region projects outwards , and its density vanishes due to high flexibility . The modeled structure for PepMV CP is , as defined for PapMV CP , an all-helix fold , and the low RMSD between the two structures ( 1 . 5 Å in the core region ) reflects their clear homology ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11795 . 003Figure 1 .

Search for helical symmetry parameters obtained in Spring package ( Desfosses et al . , 2014 ) . Several 3D maps with different helical symmetry parameters are calculated starting with bi-dimensional averaged classes . Re-projections of the calculated 3D maps are then compared with the 2D averages , and their relative cross-correlation coefficients identify possible parameters . We tested a grid with variations in the helical pitch and the number of subunits per turn and calculated low resolution reconstructions using the parameters with higher correlations . The visual inspection of these initial maps lead to the selection of the helical symmetry for PepMV sample ( better definition of CP subunits in the low-resolution map with 8 . 75 copies per turn ) . Further local searches were also performed to refine the symmetry . The high resolution of the final cryoEM map and its structural details confirmed the correct helical parameters .

The ssRNA runs in a helix of 70 Å in diameter ( Figure 1B ) . Each CP binds five ribonucleotides ( Figure 1D ) , so that the entire genome of PepMV would require 1290 copies of PepMV CP spanning 510 nm ( 3 . 95 Å of axial rise/subunit ) , which agrees with the 509 nm length originally reported for the virus ( Jones et al . , 1980 ) . The signal clearly separates the individual nucleotides , but we could not identify the bases due to the helical averaging of the variable sequence of the ssRNA . In order to explore the protein–ssRNA interactions , we modeled a polyU and included a set of four PepMV CP monomers in a molecular dynamics flexible fitting ( MDFF ) simulation ( Trabuco et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2 ) . The results show that the RNA resides in a continuous groove with a high electropositive potential ( Figure 2A ) constructed by CPs from consecutive turns of the helix . Local resolution measurements in the cryoEM map suggest a high variability in positions 3 and 4 at the segmented density for the ssRNA ( Figure 2B ) . Several amino acids display potential interactions with the phosphate backbone of the ssRNA . S92 and S94 in one face , and Q203 at the opposite side of the ssRNA might interact at positions 1 and 3 ( Figure 2C ) . Backbone torsion angles of 85° and 130° at these positions allow the binding of the base at position 2 into a deep pocket ( Figure 2D ) . Three polar-charged residues , R124 , D163 , and K196 might establish H-bonding contacts with this RNA base . D163 is in the most conserved region within the genus Potexvirus , and the consensus sequence FDFFD ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) constructs the floor of the RNA binding pocket . This pocket is large enough to accommodate pyrimidines or purines , and the presence of three amino acids ensures the interaction with the RNA regardless of the nucleotide . . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11795 . 010Figure 2 .

Sequence alignment between CP from several representatives of the genus Potexvirus . The alignment was produced by CLC Main Workbench and indicates the degree of conservation and the consensus sequence . The alignment includes CP sequences from: Pepino mosaic virus ( PepMV ) ( NP_663728 ) , Papaya mosaic virus ( PapMV ) ( P16596 ) ; Bamboo mosaic virus ( BaMV ) ( NP_042587 . 1 ) , Potato aucuba mosaic virus ( PAMV ) ( P37993 ) ; Potato virus X ( PVX ) ( P10468 ) ; Narcissus mosaic virus ( NMV ) ( NP_040782 ) ; White clover mosaic virus ( WClMV ) ( NP_620719 ) ; Lily X virus ( LVX ) ( YP_263307 ) ; Cymbidium mosaic virus ( CymMV ) ( Q00467 ) ; Plantago asiatica mosaic virus ( PlAMV ) ( NP_620840 ) ; and Foxtail mosaic virus ( FoMV ) ( NP_040992 ) . The most conserved region includes D163 in PepMV CP ( consensus sequence FDFFD in the alignment ) , one of the amino acids at the binding pocket for the ssRNA . CP , coat protein . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11795 . 013 We tested several PepMV CP mutants in trans-complementation assays ( Sempere et al . , 2011 ) . Here , a PepMV construct that expresses GFP instead of CP ( PepGFPΔCP ) acts as reporter of the complementation by the co-expression of selected CP mutants . The fluorescent signal by GFP allowed following the cell-to-cell movement of the virus . The results ( Figure 2E ) reveal that the three amino acids at the binding pocket for nucleotide at position 2 ( R124 , D163 and K196 ) are required to complement the cell-to-cell movement of the CP-defective PepMV mutant , suggesting a disruption of the CP-RNA interaction needed in virus intercellular transport . Mutant K93A also impairs viral propagation within the inoculated leaf , probably due to structural changes at the loop that contains S92 and S94 . In the case of mutant Q203A , it seems that there is a reduced movement between cells but not full impairment . We also tested the production of fully assembled virions analyzing by Western blot virion preparations from infected leaves ( see 'Materials and methods' ) . Attempts to purify PepMV virions were only fruitful for the wt and for the Q203A mutant ( Figure 2F ) , suggesting the lack of full viral assembly in the rest of PepMV CP mutants . Single amino acid changes appear to impair CP-RNA binding , probably including a cooperative effect between the hundreds of CP copies that build the virions . As described for BaMV ( DiMaio et al . , 2015 ) , the helical assembly of PepMV is mediated by the CP N-terminal arm and C-terminal extension . However , the improved resolution of the current data allowed for additional insights . The N-terminal arm from the Ni subunit interacts with a hydrophobic groove of the Ni-1 subunit and establishes the main side-by-side contact in the helical arrangement ( Figures 1A and 3A ) . A hydrophobic pocket in Ni-1 accommodates part of the N-terminal arm , where F28 from Ni fits ( Figure 3B ) . A similar type of interaction was observed between subunits in the crystal structure of PapMV CP via amino acid F13 ( Yang et al . , 2012 ) , and for BaMV , by residue W41 ( DiMaio et al . , 2015 ) . We tested in vivo the relevance of F28 in the assembly of PepMV by assaying a PepMVCP F28A mutant in trans-complementation and viral purification experiments . The F28 mutant allows cell-to-cell movement ( Figure 3C ) but does not produce fully assembled virions ( Figure 3D ) , suggesting that the tested mutation allows for the functional separation of the cell-to-cell movement of PepMV from the encapsidation of fully assembled virions , reinforcing the notion of a non-virion RNP structure during the intercellular movement of potexviruses through plasmodesmata ( Lough et al . , 2000 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11795 . 014Figure 3 .

The subunit Ni is depicted semi-transparent and includes a ribbon representation for the atomic model for PepMV CP . PepMV CP , Pepino mosaic virus coat protein . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11795 . 014 On the other hand , the C-terminal extension , a long coil with a short α-helix in its last part , builds the inner wall of the virus ( Figure 1B ) . This C-terminal segment describes a turn that runs along the axial channel and creates a network of small and local interactions ( Figure 3E ) , where each subunit contacts neighbours at upper and lower levels . Thus , the C-terminal extensions are responsible for the axial interactions that support helix formation . As for BaMV ( DiMaio et al . , 2015 ) , the flexible links between PepMV CPs via N-terminal arm and C-terminal region allow for relative movements between CPs and explain the flexuous nature of the virions . All the high-resolution structures for flexuous filamentous plant viruses correspond to representatives of the genus Potexvirus ( family Alphaflexiviridae ) and include our current data and previously reported structures of PapMV CP ( Yang et al . , 2012 ) and BaMV virions ( DiMaio et al . , 2015 ) . We cannot confirm whether members of other families of flexuous filamentous viruses ( Betaflexiviridae , Closteroviridae and Potyviridae ) have a similar fold in their CPs . We have , nevertheless , looked for structural neighbours within the database of Dali server ( Holm and Rosenstrom , 2010 ) . The search revealed that the CP structure from potexviruses shares its topology with the NP of several representatives of genus Phlebovirus ( family Bunyaviridae ) , such as Rift Valley fever virus ( RVFV ) , Toscana virus , and Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus ( SFTSV ) . These viruses infect animals , including humans , are transmitted by arthropod vectors , and pose serious public health concerns . Genera Potexvirus and Phlebovirus belong to different superfamilies of RNA viruses when these are classified based on phylogenetic relationships among RNA-dependent RNA polymerases ( RdRp ) and also have different genomic organizations ( Koonin et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , the organization of phlebovirus particles is very different . They have segmented ( - ) ssRNA associated with the NP in loose RNPs ( Raymond et al . , 2012 ) , and these are protected inside an icosahedral shell of glycoproteins inserted in a membrane , as has been observed for RVFV ( Huiskonen et al . , 2009 , Freiberg et al . , 2008 ) . The topology of CP from potexviruses and of the NP from phleboviruses ( illustrated for RVFV ) are , nonetheless , very similar ( Figures 4A and 4C ) and show a TM-score of 0 . 51 when aligned , pointing to a common family fold ( Zhang and Skolnick , 2005 ) . The similarities include: the overall topology of the all-alpha helical domain; the N-terminal arm and its binding site from the adjacent protomer , and hence , the side-by-side mechanism for oligomerization; the groove for the ssRNA binding; and the relative positions of all these elements . The crystallographic studies with phlebovirus NPs have shown tetrameric , pentameric , and hexameric oligomers , in which each NP interacts with the core of the adjacent subunit via an N-terminal arm ( Zhou et al . , 2013 ) following the same side-by-side polymerization mechanism shown in potexviruses . The divergence between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal regions . The C-terminus in PepMV CP protrudes from the core domain ( Figure 4B ) and allows longitudinal interactions for helix building . The C-terminus of the phlebovirus NP folds back into the core region and participates in the RNA-binding site that incorporates seven bases/subunit ( Figure 4D ) . The location of the C-terminal arm in phlebovirus NPs cannot support a longitudinal assembly , and hence , their RNPs remain more loosely associated ( Raymond et al . , 2012 ) than in their plant-virus counterparts . 10 . 7554/eLife . 11795 . 015Figure 4 .

Their C-termini are seen in grey color for comparison ( B and D ) . PepMV CP , Pepino mosaic virus coat protein; NP , nucleoprotein . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 11795 . 015 Both potexvirus CPs and phlebovirus NPs have in common that they bind and protect the genomic viral ssRNA . In other regards , however , these two groups are different and evolutionary distant , no one would have anticipated the structural homology that we have found . The current work provides data that suggest a horizontal gene transfer event between genera Potexvirus and Phlebovirus , or evolutionarily related forms . While potexvirus and the rest of flexible filamentous viruses infect plants , members of the genus Phlebovirus infect animals . Some representatives of the family Bunyaviridae , toposviruses , are transmitted by and replicate in arthropods , and infect plants . A similar type of virus could have mediated the transfer of CP/NP genes between distant groups of viruses with different host range . Whether the rest of flexible filamentous plant viruses share these genes remains an open question . 
 Virus preparations were obtained from N . benthamiana plants infected by PepMV-Sp13 ( Aguilar et al . , 2002 ) . For inoculations , carborundum-dusted leaves of 3 weeks old N . benthamiana plants were rubbed with a homogenate consisting of dried material from PepMV-Sp13 infected plants ground in 30 mM sodium phosphate pH 8 . 0 . Inoculated plants were kept in a growth chamber ( 16 hr photoperiod , 18ºC/26ºC night/day , respectively ) for 2 additional weeks . Virions were purified from N . benthamiana systemically infected leaves following a previously described method ( AbouHaidar et al . , 1998 ) slightly modified . Briefly , infected leaves were homogenized in a buffer containing 0 . 1 M Tris-citric acid ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 0 . 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0 . 01 M sodium thioglycolate . Triton-X-100 was added ( 1% v/v ) to the homogenized tissue and mixed for 15 min with constant stirring at 4°C . Chloroform was added to a final concentration of 25% and mixed for 30 min with constant stirring at 4°C . Then , the mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 12 , 000 g , and viruses were precipitated from the aqueous phase by adding PEG 6000 to a concentration of 5% ( w/v ) . The mixture was then kept with constant stirring for 60 min at 4°C , and centrifuged for 15 min at 10 , 000 g . Virus concentration was estimated by OD readings at 260 nm , with ε0 . 1% = 2 . 9 as extinction coefficient ( AbouHaidar et al . , 1998 ) . Virions were kept refrigerated ( 4–6°C ) in suspension buffer ( 0 . 1 M Tris-citric acid pH 8 ) until observation . The PepMVCP gene was cloned into the binary vector pGWB2 giving raise to plasmid pGWB2-CP , and mutants were constructed based on this plasmid using standard overlapping PCR and molecular cloning methods ( Sambrook and Russell , 2001 ) . For functional analysis , we tested the complementation of a PepMV construct ( pBPepGFPΔCP ) that expressed GFP instead of CP by trans CP expression of selected mutants ( Sempere et al . , 2011 ) . Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 was transformed with the different CP constructs and used in trans-complementation assays . A . tumefaciens overnight cultures ( 150 ml ) were centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 min , and pellets were resuspended in agroinfiltration buffer ( 10 mM MES pH 5 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl2 , and 100 μM acetosyringone ) until OD600 = 0 . 6 . The resulting suspensions , carrying plasmids pBPepGFPΔCP ( Sempere et al . , 2011 ) , the CP constructs and pBP19 , were mixed in a 3:3:2 ratio and 6 weeks old N . benthamiana plants were vacuum-infiltrated with the mixture . At 4 and 6 days post infiltration , plants were observed under UV light ( 365 nm ) using a handheld lamp ( Blak Ray B100-AP lamp , UV products , Upland , CA 91786 , USA ) . CP was detected by Western blotting in virion preparations and in protein extracts from leaves agroinfiltrated with CP constructs and pBP19 . For protein extractions , 100 mg samples of N . benthamiana leaves were ground in 200 μl of protein extraction buffer ( 0 . 1 M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 125 mM 2-mercaptoethanol , 200 μM PMSF , 10% glycerol ) . Crude extracts were mixed with 5x loading buffer and separated by SDS–PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes . Blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits against PepMV CP ( AC Diagnostics , Fayetteville , AR ) followed by detection with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) coupled to horseradish peroxidase ( Promega , Fitchburg , WI ) and chemiluminescence ( SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate , Thermo Scientific ) . At 6–8 days post infiltration , N . benthamiana plants were harvested and the tissue was used to purify PepMV virions as described above . The PepMV samples were applied to Quantifoil R 2/2 holey carbon grids previously coated with a thin layer of carbon . Grids vitrified in a FEI Vitrobot were then transferred to a Titan Krios ( FEI ) electron microscope that was operated at 300 kV . Images were acquired using a Falcon II detector at nominal magnification of 59 , 000 and calibrated magnification of 102 , 967 ( 1 . 36 Å/pixel ) . Movie frames from the detector were recorded at a speed of 17 frames/s during 3 s . The total specimen dose was ~50 e−/Å2 along 51 frames . Beam-induced motion correction was performed at the level of micrographs ( Li et al . , 2013 ) in frames range 2-27 , resulting an accumulative electron dose in the sample of the corrected images of ~25 e−/Å2 . Contrast transfer function parameters were estimated using CTFTILT ( Mindell and Grigorieff , 2003 ) . Selection of helices was performed using EMAN2 ( Tang et al . , 2007 ) . The resulting data set included 833 selected helices that were processed in SPRING ( Desfosses et al . , 2014 ) software-package following a strategy of single-particle based helical reconstruction . Images were CTF corrected by phase-flipping . Global and local search of optimum helical symmetry parameters ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) resulted in helical rise/rotation of 3 . 95 Å/41 . 1° per subunit ( 8 . 76 subunits/turn and 34 . 6 Å of helical pitch ) . The cryoEM images of helices were excised in overlapping segments of 218 Å length . The segmentation of helices was performed using several different step sizes ( from 8 to 40 Å ) , yielding similar results . The final cryoEM map for PepMV contains information from about 170 , 000 asymmetric units . The resolution was estimated using the Fourier Shell Correlation ( FSC ) calculated between fully independent half-sets ( the so-called 'gold standard' ) and 0 . 5/0 . 143 cutoffs in the FSC correspond to 4 . 5/3 . 9 Å resolution ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . Local resolution variability was also estimated using ResMap ( Kucukelbir et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . The cryoEM map was subjected to an enhancement of high frequencies applying a B-factor of -200 1/Å2 and was low-pass filtered to 3 . 9 Å . The initial atomic model for PepMV CP was generated via iTasser ( Zhang , 2008 ) starting with the structure of the CP from PapMV ( Yang et al . , 2012 ) . Segmentation of the cryoEM map and the initial rigid body fitting of the iTasser model's fragment 50-196 was done manually in Chimera ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . The sequence was set on register , and the rest of the structure built using Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . The model was improved by iterative cycles of manual model rebuilding . Refmac5 ( Murshudov et al . , 1999 ) was used to refine the model and to correct geometry/stereo-chemistry problems . Non-crystallographic symmetry was used in order to improve interfaces and minimize clashes between adjacent subunits . The MolProbity and clash score statistics ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) were in the top 100th percentile when compared with atomic structures at similar resolution ( Figure 1—figure supplement 6 ) . The geometry of the ssRNA ( modeled as a polyU ) was further improved using the Rossetta Erraser tool ( Chou et al . , 2013 ) . Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out with NAMD 2 . 9 ( Phillips et al . , 2005 ) through the MDFF plug-in ( Trabuco et al . , 2008 ) . Simulations were run with the CHARMM27 force field with CMAP corrections ( Mackerell et al . , 2004 ) in explicit solvent at a gscale of 0 . 3 . Simulation parameters were kept as specified by the MDFF plug-in with the exception of margin ( 2 ) , cutoff ( 12 ) , switchdist ( 10 ) , pairlistdist ( 16 ) , nonbondedFrequency ( 1 ) , and fullElectFrequency ( 1 ) . Simulation used restraints for secondary structure , chirality and cispeptide derived from the initial atomic model . During the first 10 ns of the simulation RNA atoms were first coupled to the density while keeping the protein backbone atoms constrained and vice versa . Following this , RNA and protein heavy atoms were simultaneously fitted into the density for 30 ns . Finally , 10 , 000 steps of energy minimization were performed with a grid scaling of 0 in order to increase the stability of the resulting structure . Electrostatic surface potential was calculated in Delphi ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . The 3D cryoEM map for PepMV and the derived CP atomic model are deposited in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank ( www . emdatabank . org ) and the Protein Data Bank ( www . rcsb . org ) under accession codes EMD-3236 and 5FN1 .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results and discussion', 'Materials and methods']",['structural biology and molecular biophysics'],elife-11795-v3,234,6203,5969,26.50854700854701

These proteins stick to harmful substances , such as bacteria and other disease-causing pathogens , marking them for destruction or blocking their attack . Antibodies are highly selective , and this ability has been used to target particular molecules in research , diagnostics and therapies . Typically , antibodies need to stick to a particular segment , or ‘epitope’ , on the surface of a cell in order to trigger an immune response . Knowing where these regions are can help explain how these immune proteins work and aid the development of more effective drugs and diagnostic tools . One way to identify these sites is to measure the nano-distance between antibodies and other features on the cell surface . To do this , researchers take multiple images of the cell the antibody is attached to using light microscopy . Various statistical methods are then applied to create an ‘average image’ that has a higher resolution and can therefore be used to measure the distance between these two points more accurately . While this approach works on fixed shapes , like a perfect circle , it cannot handle human cells and bacteria which are less uniform and have more complex surfaces . Here , Kumra Ahnlide et al . have developed a new method called SiteLoc which can overcome this barrier . The method involves two fluorescent probes: one attached to a specific site on the cell’s surface , and the other to the antibody or another molecule of interest . These two probes emit different colours when imaged with a fluorescent microscope . To cope with objects that have uneven surfaces , such as cells and bacteria , the two signals are transformed to ‘follow’ the same geometrical shape . The relative distance between them is then measured using statistical methods . Using this approach , Kumra Ahnlide et al . were able to identify epitopes on a bacterium , and measure distances on the surface of human red blood cells . The SiteLoc system could make it easier to develop antibody-based treatments and diagnostic tools . Furthermore , it could also be beneficial to the wider research community who could use it to probe other questions that require measuring nanoscale distances .","Antibody binding to cell surface proteins plays a crucial role in immunity , and the location of an epitope can altogether determine the immunological outcome of a host-target interaction . Techniques available today for epitope identification are costly , time-consuming , and unsuited for high-throughput analysis . Fast and efficient screening of epitope location can be useful for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines . Cellular morphology typically varies , and antibodies often bind heterogeneously across a cell surface , making traditional particle-averaging strategies challenging for accurate native antibody localization . In the present work , we have developed a method , SiteLoc , for imaging-based molecular localization on cellular surface proteins . Nanometer-scale resolution is achieved through localization in one dimension , namely , the distance from a bound ligand to a reference surface . This is done by using topological image averaging . Our results show that this method is well suited for antibody binding site measurements on native cell surface morphology and that it can be applied to other molecular distance estimations as well . 
 The location of protein binding sites on cellular surfaces can have wide-ranging implications for various cellular processes , such as immune signalling , cell adhesion , cell migration , and phagocytosis . Antibody binding to pathogen surface proteins plays a crucial role in immunity ( Lu et al . , 2018 ) , and epitope localization affects diverse immunological outcomes , such as antibody neutralizing ability ( Law et al . , 2008; Kwong et al . , 2013; Salinas et al . , 2019; Caoili , 2014; Ivanyi , 2014 ) or autoreactivity ( Caoili , 2014; Cunningham , 2014 ) . Even though monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) treatments have proven to be successful for a wide spectrum of diseases , there are very few monoclonal antibodies clinically available for the treatment of bacterial infections ( Motley et al . , 2019 ) . Developing therapeutic mAbs against infections may require large-scale screening of highly conserved and functional epitopes ( Martín-Galiano and McConnell , 2019 ) . Antibody epitopes are typically identified using crystallography , mutagenesis , or crosslinking coupled mass spectrometry ( Abbott et al . , 2014 ) . As of today , these methods are costly , time-consuming , and unsuitable for high-throughput analysis . Fast and efficient screening of epitope locations can be useful for the development of therapeutic mAbs and vaccines . While averaging methods for nanometer-scale localization on microscopy data exist , these do not work for binding sites on proteins with heterogeneous expression on the cellular surface . Moreover , they are designed for identical ( Szymborska et al . , 2013; Laine et al . , 2015 ) or spherical ( Son et al . , 2020 ) particles and are thereby not fitted for unaltered cells due to the existing biological variation of surface morphology . In the present work , we have developed an imaging-based method for localization of binding sites with nanometer-scale precision . The location of a binding site is determined by calculating the average distance between the ligand channel and a reference signal channel using the averaged fluorescent signal along a cell contour . To assess the performance of this method , we analyse simulated images , demonstrating high accuracy for varying surface expression and morphology . By measuring the height of DNA probes on erythrocyte surfaces , we show that our method can accurately estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical cells . Our presented results with structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) data achieve an ~10 nm precision certainty . We apply the site localization method to determine known binding site locales on M protein that is unevenly expressed on the bacterial surface of Streptococcus pyogenes . Additionally , our method yields viable results when we perform site localization on widefield images with and without deconvolution . To sum up , our site localization method enables rapid determination of binding sites without the need for synthetic modification of cell surface morphology . 
 Binding site localization is based on resolving the axial distance between bound ligands and a reference surface . This is done by implementing an averaging method on high-resolution images . With this method , nanometer-scale precision is achieved by dimension reduction of surface data within an image plane . A site localization measurement on antibody-coated bacteria is exemplified in Figure 1 . Fluorescently conjugated wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) that binds bacterial peptidoglycan is used here for the reference region , and antibodies that bind to bacterial M protein are labelled with another fluorescent dye for imaging in a separate channel ( Figure 1a ) . The example shows how our method handles the uneven distribution of M protein on bacterial surfaces ( Figure 1b ) . The pipeline for the site localization method is shown in Figure 1b . For each image , bacteria are identified in the reference channel by fitting circles to an edge-detection-processed image . Each circle is isolated as a slightly larger mask and the data in the circle is polar transformed . An alignment of the reference position is performed by identifying peaks to each intensity profile . This way , the axial positions are normalized to the actual surface signal . The spatially corresponding data in the antibody channel is processed in the same manner , and the distance between the antibody and WGA signal is resolved through the averaging of multiple acquisitions of the same field of view . Altogether , a relative binding site is determined by resolving the distance between the reference and antibody channel using the cumulative measurement from multiple repeated images . A strength of the method is that it can be used for particles with a non-spherical topology and uneven staining . It is evident that the signal precision is improved as the distortion of an ovoid bacterium is accounted for through axial normalization in polar coordinates ( Figure 1c ) . To assess the performance of the site localization method , we generated simulated fluorescence images with variable surface staining and morphology . The images consisted of two channels created by sampling a fixed number of ‘photons’ from a spatial distribution . In the reference channel , the distribution was designed to emulate the spatial distribution of photons in a microscope for a cellular surface . In the target channel , a distribution based on the set of points in the reference channel at a chosen perpendicular distance was used . The perpendicular distance between the reference channel distribution and the target channel distribution was chosen to be 2 px corresponding to 41 nm using the pixel length of our N-SIM microscopy setup . In order to mimic the experimental process of acquiring repeated frames of each data point in a time series , for each chosen shape 100 time series were created with 10 frames each . The results , shown in Figure 2 , indicate that a high accuracy can be achieved for various cell surface patterns . However , for certain shapes , the method yields a slightly larger distance than the true value ( Figure 2b ) . The reported accuracy for site localization measurements on the simulations in relation to number of cells is assessed and presented in Figure 2c . To explore sources of uncertainty in site localization measurements , additional images were simulated to represent different types of labelling ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . As expected , the uncertainty is larger with secondary antibody labelling than with direct labelling . The site localization uncertainty also increases when the SNR is decreased . These results demonstrate the robustness of the site localization method for varying surface expression and morphology . In order to test the method in vitro , we performed site localization measurements on surface-tethered dsDNA probes of known lengths . Human erythrocytes were stained with membrane dye CellBrite Fix 488 and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated dsDNA of varying length ( Figure 3b ) . Images were acquired using an N-SIM microscope . To begin with , swelled spherical erythrocytes were analysed with the site localization method as well as with an existing method for determining molecular heights on spherical particles ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . The results show good agreement . Site localization was thereafter performed on non-spherical erythrocytes and show results equivalent to that of spherical cells ( Figure 3c ) . We further tested the method’s capabilities by measuring the height of dsDNA with varying lengths on the surface of non-spherical red blood cells ( Figure 3e ) . The measured heights are approximately half of the full length of the DNA strands . The measurements agree well with the predicted worm-like chain ( WLC ) model height for DNA strands , with a persistence length of 50 nm ( Baumann et al . , 1997 ) , tethered to a surface and able to freely rotate . Altogether , we show that our method can accurately estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical cellular surfaces . Site localization measurements that were performed for ligands on bacterial M protein agree well with previously reported data . The antibody Fc binding site on M protein is located at the S region ( Akesson et al . , 1994 ) , and a non-specific monoclonal IgG antibody ( Xolair ) is used for site localization of this binding . Additionally , a measurement is carried out for an M protein-specific mAb , Ab49 ( Bahnan et al . , 2021 ) , with an epitope located in the B3-S region , that is , slightly further along the IgGFc binding region . For determining binding to the far end of M protein , we used fibrinogen that has two binding sites at the B1 and B2 region ( Hauri et al . , 2019 ) . We thus expect the binding sites to be arranged in accordance with the schematic shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1c . S . pyogenes strain SF370 was stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated WGA and coated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated Xolair , Ab49 , or fibrinogen ( Figure 4a ) . Images of single bacteria were acquired using an N-SIM microscope . The median resolved distance is [median ( IQR ) ] 5 . 6 ( 29 . 7 ) nm for the Xolair Fc binding site , 6 . 2 ( 29 . 8 ) nm for Ab49 Fab binding site , and 18 . 0 ( 49 . 3 ) nm for the two fibrinogen binding sites . The reported accuracy for site localization measurements on S . pyogenes in relation to number of biological replicates is assessed and presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 . To further explore sources of uncertainty in site localization measurements , the antibody binding sites were measured with secondary antibody labelling and compared to direct labelling ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . The presented results are consistent with the arrangement of the binding sites as reported in the literature ( Akesson et al . , 1994; Bahnan et al . , 2021; Hauri et al . , 2019 ) . By performing site localization measurements on widefield images , we show that our method can yield viable results even with conventional microscopy data . Moreover , deconvolution of the widefield images may yield an increase in precision . Widefield images were acquired with the same optical system ( see SIM in previous section ) , with the exception of the light source used being LED-based instead of laser-based . Comparison of site localization measurements using SIM and widefield was performed on two sets of samples; fibrinogen- and Xolair-coated S . pyogenes . Widefield and SIM images were acquired on separate datasets . For the fibrinogen samples ( Figure 5b ) , the median resolved distance between the two channels is [median ( IQR ) ] 18 . 0 ( 49 . 3 ) nm with SIM data , 38 . 5 ( 71 . 0 ) nm with widefield data , and 40 . 1 ( 42 . 0 ) nm with deconvolved widefield data . For the Xolair samples ( Figure 5d ) , the median resolved distance for the Xolair Fc binding site is 5 . 6 ( 29 . 7 ) nm with SIM data , 12 . 3 ( 76 . 5 ) nm with widefield data , and 14 . 2 ( 34 . 5 ) nm with deconvolved widefield data . This indicates that the site localization method performs well with widefield images and that the precision can be increased through deconvolution . 
 The locations of protein binding sites on cellular surfaces are important for a wide range of cellular processes . In particular , how and where an antibody binds to pathogen surface structures is critical for the outcome of host-pathogen interactions . This is especially relevant for bacteria as they are known to target antibodies in many different ways ( Nordenfelt et al . , 2012; Nordenfelt and Björck , 2013 ) . Knowing the location of the epitope greatly aids both mechanistic understanding and facilitates potential therapeutic development . We have developed a method for imaging-based localization of binding sites on cellular surface proteins with nanometer-scale precision . Super-resolution techniques such as iPALM , STORM , and STED can in practice achieve an ~10 nm resolution but are costly imaging systems that typically require complex sample preparation . Here , an ~10 nm ( ~12 nm IQR , ~9 nm SD ) precision is achieved with diffraction-limited microscopy images by dimension reduction of surface data within an image plane . Existing imaging-based averaging methods are designed for identical or spherical particles and therefore not suited for site localization on native cell surface morphology . This is made possible with our method through normalization of the axial positions of a reference surface . To assess the performance of the site localization method , we analysed simulated images with variable staining and morphology . These results indicate that a 1 nm precision could be achievable under ideal conditions and show that the site localization method is highly accurate for varying topologies and inhomogeneous surface expression . To test our method in vitro , we measured the height of DNA probes on erythrocyte surfaces . These results validate that our method can accurately estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical cells . Additionally , the results for spherical cells were confirmed using an existing method for site localization on spherical objects , showing good agreement . We have applied our site localization method to determine known binding site locales on M protein that is unevenly expressed on the bacterial surface of S . pyogenes . Our presented results show that this method is suited even for cells with non-spherical topology . However , it has proven difficult to perform site localization measurements on bacteria . This may be due to the small size of bacteria . We show that our method yields viable results with conventional microscopy and demonstrate that the precision may be increased by deconvolution of widefield images . Furthermore , our in silico experiments , as well as our in vitro experiments , indicate that the variation in the measurements can be minimized by increasing SNR and minimizing the biological variability , for example , by using directly conjugated antibodies instead of secondary labelling . We believe this method may be useful for rapid screening of epitope locales , and the implementation , written in the open-source language Julia , is provided on GitHub . 
 S . pyogenes strain SF370 wildtype was cultured overnight in THY medium ( Todd Hewitt Broth; Bacto; BD , complemented with 0 . 2% [w/v] yeast ) at 37°C in an atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO2 . Strain SF370 expresses M1 protein on its surface and is available through the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC 700294 ) ( Ferretti et al . , 2001 ) . The bacteria were harvested at early log phase and washed twice with PBS . Xolair ( omalizumab , Novartis ) is a humanized monoclonal IgG that is IgE-specific , and thus only binds to M protein via Fc . Ab49 is an M protein-specific antibody ( Bahnan et al . , 2021 ) . For secondary antibody labelling , both antibodies were treated with IdeS ( Hansa Biopharma ) ( von Pawel-Rammingen et al . , 2002 ) , an enzyme that cleaves IgG at the hinge region , separating the F ( ab’ ) 2 from the Fc . The fibrinogen used here was isolated from human plasma and conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 ( Invitrogen ) . Direct conjugation of antibodies was done using the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor 647 ( Invitrogen ) . The desiccated dye was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mg/ml . The antibodies were concentrated to a concentration of 2 mg/ml , and 1/10th of the final volume of sodium bicarbonate ( 1 M , pH 8 . 3 ) was added . The dye was added at a final concentration of 75 µg/mg of antibody . The antibodies were then incubated with the dye at room temperature ( RT ) for an hour . To remove any unbound dye , the antibodies were transferred to 50 kDa Amicon ultra filter columns ( Merck Millipore ) . The antibodies were washed by adding PBS and centrifuging ( 12 , 000 × g ) . This was done three times to ensure all unbound dye had been removed . Conjugated antibody concentration and degree of labelling were assessed by using a DeNovix DS-11 FX spectrometer . Bacteria were sonicated ( VialTweeter; Hielscher ) for 0 . 5 min to separate any aggregates and incubated fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min on ice . The bacteria were thereafter washed with PBS twice ( 10 , 000 × g , 2 min ) . SF370 wildtype was stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated WGA . Bacteria were incubated with IdeS-cleaved Xolair , Ab49 , or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated Fibrinogen ( Invitrogen ) . The antibody samples were stained with fluorescently labelled IgGFab- or IgGFc-specific F ( ab’ ) 2 fragments ( Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-human IgGFc or IgGFab; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) . Samples were set on glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with No . 1 . 5 coverslips . DNA height probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies and purified with HPLC and resuspended in Tris buffer with 1 mM EDTA . The two strands are composed of a forward oligonucleotide and a reverse oligonucleotide . The sequences can be found in Key resources table . Venous blood was taken from a human donor and washed with PBS three times ( 750 × g , 5 min ) . The red blood cell pellet was treated with TrypLE at 37°C for 15 min and thereafter washed once ( 750 × g , 5 min ) . The red blood cells were then resuspended in CellBrite Fix 488 membrane staining solution ( 1:200 of stock solution 1000X ) and incubated for 15 min at RT . For swelling of cells , the staining was in a 70% isotonic solution . The cells were fixed in a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0 . 2% glutaraldehyde at RT for 20 min . The cells were then washed twice ( 500 × g , 5 min ) and resuspended in 500 µl PBS . 1 µl of DNA height probe was added to 3 µl of fixed red blood cells in 50 µl PBS . Samples were set on glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with No . 1 . 5 coverslips . The DNA height prediction was performed by using a previously derived analytical expression for the probability distribution ( p⁢ ( r , t ) ) of the end-to-end distance in the WLC model ( Murphy et al . , 2004 ) :p ( r , t ) =4πA ( t ) r2 ( 1−r2 ) 9/2exp⁡ ( −3t4 ( 1−r2 ) ) where A is a normalization constant defined asA ( t ) =4 ( 3t4 ) 3/2exp⁡ ( 3t4 ) π3/2 ( 4+123t/4+15 ( 3t/4 ) 2 ) and r and t are defined asr=LLp , t=RL where L is the contour length , Lp is the persistence length , and R is the end-to-end distance . The expected end-to-end length given a persistence length of 50 nm was calculated for each DNA strand length . The height was then obtained by finding the centre of mass of a rod with the calculated length tethered to a surface with one end allowed to rotate freely in a hemisphere ( Son et al . , 2020 ) . To generate the fluorescence images , plane curves with a parameterization were chosen . The curves that were not ellipses were chosen to be quadratic B-splines since this yields a continuous derivative and makes the necessary computations simple . To get closer to an arc-length parameterization , the curve was discretized by walking around the curve and at each point taking steps inversely proportional to the analytically determined magnitude of the gradient at that point . The photons for the reference channel were generated by sampling values from this discrete parameterization . To simulate the membrane width , an offset perpendicular to the gradient was sampled from a uniform distribution of the desired width . Another random offset was sampled from a two-dimensional normal distribution to simulate the effect of the point spread function . The target channel was simulated in the same way but with an additional offset in the direction normal to the gradient at the sampled point of the curve . When antibody labelling was simulated , a 15 nm offset was added in a random three-dimensional direction for each antibody . For all included simulations , an offset of 2 px was chosen , corresponding to a distance of 41 nm for a pixel length of 20 . 5 nm . The code was implemented in Julia and is available on GitHub ( nordenfeltLab/FluoroDist . jl ) . Images of single bacteria were acquired using a Nikon N-SIM microscope with LU-NV laser unit , CFI SR HP Apochromat TIRF ×100 Oil objective ( N . A . 1 . 49 ) and an additional ×1 . 5 magnification . The camera used was ORCA-Flash 4 . 0 sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics K . K . ) , and the images were reconstructed with Nikon’s SIM software on NIS-Elements Ar ( NIS-A 6D and N-SIM Analysis ) . Fluorescent beads ( 100 nm ) were imaged to measure and correct for chromatic aberration , as well as for the N-SIM grating alignment . Single cells were manually identified and imaged with 488 and 640 nm lasers in time series with 15–20 frames , depending on initial sample signal . For CSOP ( Son et al . , 2020 ) analysis , images of singles cells were acquired in 15 slices with step sizes of 50 nm . TetraSpeck 0 . 1 µm fluorescent microspheres are mounted on No . 1 . 5 coverslips using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant in the same manner as the bacterial samples . These beads are used for the objective collar correction , SIM grating alignment , and measurement of SIM and widefield PSF . Images of the beads were acquired and chromatic aberration was corrected for by performing image registration ( Holylab/RegisterQD . jl ) and applying the found transform to all images . A Circle Hough Transform ( Illingworth and Kittler , 1987 ) and Canny Edge Detection ( Canny , 1986 ) were used for circle fitting and edge detection , respectively . Images were filtered by SNR ( approximately > 3 ) as calculated using10log10⁡ ( maximagemedianimage ) as an SNR estimate . The time series were cut as the SNR relative to the first time frame fell below a given percentage ( typically 30% ) , which is set as an input to the code . A polar transformation of the found circle was performed on a bicubic interpolation of the image . The alignment of the peak intensity was performed by identifying a peak maximum using a sliding average . Labelling of the cell wall with two different fluorescent dyes should give a distance estimation of zero . The measured offset , shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 , is likely due to chromatic aberration at the imaging plane . This offset is used to correct for chromatic aberration in subsequent site localization measurements by correcting the position of the reference region prior to calculating distance to the ligand signal . To avoid attaining out-of-focus peaks in the ligand channel , peak identification was performed beyond the reference region . The number of bacteria , together with median ( IQR ) and mean ± SD , is given in the figure captions . The widefield images were deconvolved using the Richardson–Lucy algorithm ( Richardson , 1972; Lucy , 1974 ) in 10 iterations . The analysis pipeline , written in Julia , is provided on GitHub ( nordenfeltLab/SiteLocalization ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['short report', 'cell biology', 'immunology and inflammation']",elife-64709-v1,127,4247,4120,33.44094488188976

The causes of most cases of high blood pressure are unknown , but it is often accompanied by the reduced flow of blood through small vessels in the skin and other parts of the body that are a long way from the heart . It is not clear why this change happens or why it tends to get worse over time in people with high blood pressure that has not been treated . Previous research has shown that when a tissue is starved of oxygen , blood flow to that tissue will increase . The HIF family of proteins help to increase blood flow to tissues in these low-oxygen situations . To investigate what role the skin plays in the flow of blood through small vessels , Cowburn et al . exposed mutant mice that cannot produce certain HIF proteins specifically in the skin to low-oxygen conditions . The experiments show that mice lacking either HIF-1α or HIF-2α in the skin have altered responses to oxygen starvation that affected their heart rate , blood pressure , skin temperature and general levels of activity . Mice lacking specific proteins controlled by the HIFs also responded in a similar way . Cowburn et al . also demonstrated that the way normal healthy mice respond to oxygen starvation is more complex than previously thought . Blood pressure and heart rate rise in during the first ten minutes . This is followed by a period of up to 36 hours where blood pressure and heart rate decrease below normal levels . By around 48 hours after exposure to low levels of oxygen , blood pressure and heart rate recover , returning to normal levels . Loss of the HIF proteins or other proteins involved in the response to oxygen starvation specifically in the skin affect when this process starts and how long it takes . These findings suggest that the responses of the skin to environmental challenges may have substantial effects on the how the heart pumps blood around the body . More studies are needed to understand how the HIFs and other proteins may contribute to high blood pressure and diseases affecting the heart and blood vessels .","Systemic vascular pressure in vertebrates is regulated by a range of factors: one key element of control is peripheral resistance in tissue capillary beds . Many aspects of the relationship between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance are unclear . An important example of this is the relationship between hypoxic response in individual tissues , and the effect that response has on systemic cardiovascular adaptation to oxygen deprivation . We show here how hypoxic response via the HIF transcription factors in one large vascular bed , that underlying the skin , influences cardiovascular response to hypoxia in mice . We show that the response of the skin to hypoxia feeds back on a wide range of cardiovascular parameters , including heart rate , arterial pressures , and body temperature . These data represent the first demonstration of a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in a peripheral tissue directly modifying cardiovascular response to the challenge of hypoxia . 
 Vertebrates confront the world chiefly through the skin . As a reflection of how different vertebrates adapt to the environment , skin structure varies to a significant degree from one vertebrate class to another , and even within classes . One of the key differences in skin function found amongst vertebrates is the degree to which it responds to environmental variations; in particular , the extent to which these changes in turn affect systemic organismal physiology . Mammalian skin is amongst the most complex of all the vertebrate forms of skin . It also varies significantly in its form in the different orders of mammalia , with variations chiefly following adaptations to the external environment . A key physiological challenge faced by most multicellular organisms is variation in oxygen supply . This is a common challenge to animals that obtain their oxygen from surrounding water , particularly those that live in fresh water; it can apply also to mammals at high altitudes , or during movement into a small den or confined space . Hypoxia also occurs in various tissues if there are high levels of oxygen demand , e . g . , in skeletal muscle during exercise . Work undertaken over the last 50 years has shown that acute systemic hypoxia in mice , rats , rabbits , chickens , dogs , sheep and humans causes acute tachycardia and hypertension ( Korner and Edwards , 1960; Butler , 1967; Yasuma and Hayano , 2000; Campen et al . , 2004; Campen et al . , 2005; Walsh and Marshall , 2006; Heinonen et al . , 2016; Giussani et al . , 1993; Fletcher , 2000 ) . Prolonged hypobaric hypoxia in humans has also been shown to cause tachycardia and hypertension ( these studies have primarily been undertaken in high altitude environments or models thereof ) ( Schultz et al . , 2014; Calbet , 2003; Naeije , 2010; Hainsworth et al . , 2007; Vogel and Harris , 1967 ) . The skin has an extensive vasculature , which is known to be responsive to shifts in oxygen availability ( Durand et al . , 1969; Weil et al . , 1969; Kuwahira et al . , 1993; Minson , 2003 ) . Keratinocytes in low oxygen release nitric oxide to increase blood flow and thereby improve perfusion ( Cowburn et al . , 2013; Pucci et al . , 2012 ) . Of interest , it has been shown that in both rodents and humans the basal epidermis is hypoxic relative to the underlying dermal tissue , and displays constitutive stabilisation of hypoxia inducible transcription factor- ( HIF ) α proteins ( Cowburn et al . , 2013; Cowburn et al . , 2014; Peyssonnaux et al . , 2008; Boutin et al . , 2008 ) . HIF transcription factors initiate the transcription of multiple genes involved in oxygen homeostasis , including a number that regulate vascularisation and metabolism ( Semenza , 2003; Semenza , 2009; Pouysségur et al . , 2006; Formenti et al . , 2010; Djagaeva and Doronkin , 2010; Hubbi et al . , 2014 ) . We have previously shown that a dichotomous regulation of nitric oxide is conferred by HIF-1α and HIF-2α regulation of the NOS2 and arginase genes ( Semenza , 2003; Jung et al . , 2000 ) and have now documented this in a number of tissues and cell types ( Cowburn et al . , 2013; Takeda et al . , 2010; Branco-Price et al . , 2012; Cowburn et al . , 2016 ) . The HIF-1α/NOS2 and HIF-2α/arginase pathways strongly influence tissue L-arginine consumption and NO generation ( Cowburn et al . , 2013; Takeda et al . , 2010; Branco-Price et al . , 2012 ) . We have also shown that keratinocyte selective deletion of HIF-1α reduces epidermal NO levels , whereas loss of HIF-2α suppresses arginase expression/activity , increasing local concentrations of NO ( Cowburn et al . , 2013 ) . Hence , in murine skin , cutaneous NO levels are determined by differential HIFα isoform expression which affect both local vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure . Little is known , however , concerning how a localized tissue response to hypoxia affects the cardiovascular system more generally . The literature on the response of animals to systemic hypoxia and its cardiovascular effects is limited almost exclusively to studies under anaesthesia . Hence , almost all previous studies have focused on the first ten minutes of the hypoxic response . Radio-telemetry in non-anesthetised non-restrained animals allows a more rigorous evaluation of the changes in hemodynamic variables during the acclimation to environmental hypoxia ( Kawaguchi et al . , 2005 ) . The work described here demonstrates for the first time that systemic hypoxia induces a tri-modal response: with an initial tachycardia and hypertensive phase that lasts approximately 10 min , followed by an immediate and profound drop in heart rate and blood pressure that can last as long as 24 hr , followed by a recovery to close to a normoxic state . In this context , we show that peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing , in this case in the skin , plays an essential role in this systemic cardiovascular response . These data demonstrate that peripheral tissues can play a fundamental role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia . 
 In this study we utilise mouse strains with conditional alleles of Hif1a ( Ryan et al . , 2000 ) , Epas1 ( HIF-2α ) ( Gruber et al . , 2007 ) , the HIF-1α target gene , nitric oxide synthase-2 ( Nos2 ) and the HIF-2α target gene , arginase-1 ( Arg1 ) ( El Kasmi et al . , 2008 ) , crossed to mouse strains expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the keratin 14 ( Krt14 ) promoter ( Vasioukhin et al . , 1999 ) . All mice are extensively backcrossed ( more than 10 generations after selection by strain-specific SNP analysis ) into the C57/Bl6J strain background . This promoter drives the excision of the gene of interest where the K14 promoter is active , that is , within basal layers of the epidermis and in restricted numbers of cells in a small number of other epithelial tissues , chiefly the oesophagus and salivary and mammary glands ( Vasioukhin et al . , 1999 ) . Continuous monitoring of unrestrained , non-anesthetised mice via radio-telemetric catheterization showed that although resting heart rates were unchanged in all mutants relative to wild type controls ( n = 7 ) through diurnal variation ( Figure 1A ) , there was a constitutive hypotensive state in K14cre-HIF-2α mice ( n = 7 ) and NOS2 mutants ( n = 6 ) ( Figure 1B ) and a strong trend towards a hypertensive state in K14cre-HIF-1α mice . Cutaneous temperatures were also monitored by radiotelemetry ( Figure 1C ) . Here , we saw that cutaneous temperatures in K14cre-Arg-1 mutants was significantly higher than littermate controls and trend lower in HIF-1α mutants . These data confirm our previous observations using tail-cuff occlusion and infra-red analysis of skin temperature ( Cowburn et al . , 2013 ) . Analysis of physical activity showed no significant difference in the movement levels between the mutant groups and littermate control mice , suggesting these differences in temperature do not result from variable activity ( Figure 1D ) . The effects of hypoxia in mammals have been studied in humans and a range of animals ( Korner and Edwards , 1960; Butler , 1967; Yasuma and Hayano , 2000; Heinonen et al . , 2016; Kawaguchi et al . , 2005 ) . Curiously , published measurements to date indicate that almost all studies examining the cardiovascular effects of hypoxia have been carried out either over long time frames , that is , weeks and months , as part of studies of high altitude adaptations , or over very short time frames of approximately 5 to 10 min , typically under anaesthesia . To better understand how hypoxia at varying levels affects the cardiovascular parameters of blood pressure , heart rate , and cutaneous temperature in mice over time , we subjected wild-type ( C57/Bl6 ) mice with implanted radiotelemetric reporters to 15% , 12% , and 10% normobaric oxygen over 48 hr , followed by 24 hr of recovery at 21% normobaric oxygen . The transition to low oxygen levels occurred in each case at the dark-light interphase ( dark cycle equates to the shaded regions in the graphs ) . As noted above , the acute cardiovascular response to hypoxia has been described in a number of animal models . As previous investigators have documented , there was an acute response in the first 10–15 min , with increased ventilation ( 160BrPM to 250BrPM ) , and a hypoxic pressor reflex , with blood pressures increasing from means of 123/88 mmHg ( baseline ) to 143/102 mmHg within the first 10 min ( Figure 2A–B ) . Following this brief initial response , there was a severe drop in systemic blood pressures at the 12% and 10% oxygen levels , to means of 87 mmHg SBP and 57 mmHg DBP at 120 min for 10% oxygen ( Figure 2C–D ) . Heart rates peak at 13 min in the lowest level of hypoxia , from 606 BPM ( baseline ) to 717 BPM at the lowest levels of oxygen , followed immediately by a decline to 285 BPM ( a 53% drop from baseline ) at 120 min post-transition ( Figure 2E–F ) . Analysis of subcutaneous temperature has previously been used as an indirect measurement of peripheral vascular resistance ( Schey et al . , 2009 ) . We found that skin temperature rapidly decreased from 33 . 7°C ( baseline ) to 28 . 9°C ( −4 . 8°C ) 180mins post hypoxic challenge ( Figure 2G ) , suggesting an increase in peripheral vascular resistance . Physical activity also declined from 5 . 3 m/hr to 0 . 2 m/hr in the 120 min following the introduction of 10% oxygen . This change , similar to those seen in blood pressure and heart rate , demonstrates that lowered levels of oxygen cause a triphasic cardiovascular response , with the degree and duration of this response dependent on the level of oxygen . At the lowest FiO2 studied , 10% oxygen , there was an initial phase of response lasting 10–20 min that includes increased blood pressures and heart rates; then a longer depression , resulting in profound hypotension and bradycardia; followed finally by a chronic acclimation phase , with gradually recovering blood pressures , heart rates , temperatures and activity levels . We defined recovery as the point at which the animal reached 90% of heart rates and blood pressures seen at the same time of the diurnal cycle in normoxia; with this definition , recovery occured in 36 hr at 10% oxygen levels in wild type controls . In wild type mice this tri-phasic response is readily apparent at the two lower concentrations of oxygen ( Figure 2 ) . We chose to use a 10% oxygen challenge for the remainder of our experiments , as this level of hypoxia had the most pronounced ( and thus easily dissected ) phases of response , and yet still showed a return to normoxic cardiovascular parameters over time . As shown above , mice lacking HIF-1α , HIF-2α , NOS2 and Arg-1 expression in the epidermis show significant changes in systemic blood pressures and cutaneous temperatures relative to littermate control animals . All of these genes are involved in cellular adaptations to hypoxia . However , it is unclear how this cellular adaptation leads to more general tissue-specific adaptations to hypoxia . Even less well understood is how a peripheral tissue response might affect systemic responses to hypoxia . To undertake an analysis of that question , using the skin as a model for a peripheral tissue with a substantial vascular bed , we analysed the effect of loss of these hypoxia-responsive genes on the cardiovascular hypoxic response . We began with an analysis of the role of HIF-1α . As described above and shown in Figure 1 , there is a decrease in skin temperature in mice lacking HIF-1α in keratinocytes . In these mice , the onset of 10% environmental hypoxia causes a sharper drop in skin temperatures ( Figure 3A ) than that seen in littermate control animals , and temperatures of the skin in HIF-1α mutants remain well below those of littermate mice in the second phase of hypoxic response; they do not recover until the restoration of normoxia ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9A ) . Infra-red analysis of skin temperature was also used to monitor peripheral vascular perfusion during hypoxic challenge . The initial drop in skin temperature was comparable between K14cre-HIF-1α mutant and littermate control mice , as shown in Figure 3B . As described above , the HIF-1α mutants are essentially hypertensive under normoxic conditions , and this hypertension is exaggerated in the first phase of hypoxic response ( Figure 3C , for statistical analysis see Figure 9B ) . However , in the second phase there is a larger drop in systolic and diastolic pressures relative to littermate control mice ( Figure 3D , for statistical analysis see Figure 9C ) . This resolves rapidly , and although the subsequent systolic pressures in mutants are similar to those in littermate control animals , the diastolic pressures in the mutants begin to elevate . This elevated diastolic pressure begins in the first hour of hypoxia , and gradually increases throughout the 48 hr of hypoxic exposure ( Figure 3D ) . An elevation in systolic pressures in HIF-1α mutants does not reappear until the animals are restored to normoxia . Elevation of diastolic pressures is indicative of an increase in peripheral resistance , and this is consistent with the lowered skin temperatures described above ( Figure 3A ) . In Figure 3E and F , the acute and chronic changes in heart rate in littermate control and mutant animals can be seen ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9D and E ) . The chief difference seen in the HIF-1α mutants is an increase in heart rate that is likely required to sustain systolic pressures; this coincides with the relative increase in diastolic pressures in HIF-1α mutants . Unlike the increased diastolic pressure , this tachycardia resolves following approximately 36 hr of hypoxia , indicating cardiac acclimation has occurred at that point . The chronic change in heart rate in HIF-1α mutants appears to coincide with an increase in whole-body metabolic activity between 12–36 hr hypoxia , as determined by VO2 and VCO2 analysis ( Figure 3G and H ) . Normal metabolic activity is only restored when the animals are returned to normoxia . Physical activity is reduced in littermate control and mutant animals during the initial 12 hr of hypoxia . Activity slowly increases during the acclimation period , but does not fully recover until the animals are restored to normoxia ( Figure 3H ) . Overall , loss of HIF-1α in the epidermis appears to delay the cardiovascular changes that occur in response to hypoxia; this is correlated with an increase in peripheral resistance and in heart rates . We have proposed a model for hypoxic responses involving HIF isoform activity and nitric oxide homeostasis in the skin that argues that hypoxia results in an initial HIF-1α/NOS2/NO mediated increase in vascular diameter , and resulting increases in perfusion; followed by a HIF-2α/Arginase-induced reduction of intracellular L-arginine ( Cowburn et al . , 2013 ) . As L-arginine is necessary for NO production , this would suppress NO production by NO synthases , and ultimately cause vasoconstriction . This model for HIFα isoform action in hypoxic vascular tissues fits the observations described above for the loss of HIF-1α in the skin . In animals lacking HIF-2α in the epidermis , adaptation of skin temperatures in the first 12 hr of hypoxia follows the predictions of this model ( Figure 4A ) , that is , we see elevated skin temperatures in the HIF-2α mutants relative to littermate control animals . These data are supported by infra-red analysis of skin temperature during short term hypoxia exposure ( Figure 4B ) . The recorded drop in skin temperature is significantly less in the HIF-2α mutants relative to littermate control animals . Representative photomicrographs show the rapid drop in skin temperature during hypoxia exposure . However , after 24 hr , skin temperatures in mutants drop relative to littermate control animals , and remain lower than those of littermate control animals for 12 hr , before rising again to levels similar to those of littermate controls . Upon restoration of environmental normoxia , skin temperatures in mutants return to levels slightly higher than those seen in littermate control animals , that is , similar to those seen at steady state ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9F ) . As shown in Figure 1 , mean blood pressures of HIF-2α mutants are significantly lower than those of littermate control animals . For the first 24 hr of hypoxia , HIF-2α mutants show elevated systolic and diastolic pressures that are evident in the first minutes of hypoxic exposure ( Figure 4C , [for statistical analysis see Figure 9G] and Figure 4D , [for statistical analysis see Figure 9H] ) . Here again , there is a shift at 24 hr , and although diastolic pressures at that point are similar to those seen in littermate control animals , systolic pressure drops relative to littermate controls . The systolic blood pressures remain substantially lower until normoxia is restored , when they return to steady state and mildly hypotensive levels . Finally , at the return of normoxia , diastolic pressures rise to levels substantially higher than those seen in littermate control animals for approximately 12 hr , before finally dropping again 24 hr after the restoration of normoxia . This effect on both systolic and diastolic pressures indicates that changes in the skin affect both traditionally understood changes in peripheral resistance , that is , changes that result in altered diastolic pressures , and other changes that can influence systolic pressures . The effect of hypoxia on the heart rate of the epidermal HIF-2α knockout animals is strikingly altered when compared to the effect on littermate control animals . Hypoxia has virtually no effect on heart rate in the HIF-2α mutant animals ( Figure 4E , for statistical analysis see Figure 9I ) ; they show a diurnal variation of heart rate that is essentially the same as that seen in animals in normoxic conditions ( Figure 4F , for statistical analysis see Figure 9J ) . This is in comparison to the approximate 50% decline in heart rates seen in littermate control animals after two hours at 10% oxygen . Whole-body metabolic activity ( VO2 and VCO2 ) in HIF-2α mutant animals is also significantly increased above littermate control rates between 12–24 hr hypoxia ( Figure 4G and H ) . This increased metabolic activity does not return to levels seen in littermate control animals until the mice are returned to normoxia . Physical activity , similarly to the patterns described above , is greatly reduced in littermate and mutant animals during the initial 12 hr of hypoxia . However , activity of HIF-2α mutant animals recovers substantially between 12–48 hr , although it does not fully recover until the animals are restored to normoxia ( Figure 4I ) . These results indicate a complex response of the skin to systemic hypoxia , and also demonstrate that that complexity is mirrored in the effect of those responses on the cardiovascular system . The crossover seen in skin temperature and blood pressure at 24 hr also indicates that there is likely a phase of adaptation at that time point revealed by the HIF-2α deletion , and related to a temporally specific action of HIF-2α in the adaptation and response to hypoxia . Given the complex role of HIF-2α in the epidermis , and our hypothesis that this could be determined by the differential effect of HIF-1α and HIF-2α on NO homeostasis , we next analysed the overall levels of NO metabolites induced by hypoxia in specific tissues following hypoxic exposure ( Figure 5 ) . As can be seen in Figure 5A , there was a steep drop in plasma NO metabolites over the first day of hypoxia , followed by a more gradual decline over the following 3 days of exposure ( Figure 5A ) . However , as shown in Figure 5B , in skin , and in Figure 5C , in lungs , differing levels of expression of hypoxia-sensitive genes involved in the NO synthesis pathway are evident . Of note , the skin shows an initial spike in arginase-1 and -2 expression in the first 24 hr of exposure , which then declines . Skin NOS2 expression over the same time is marginally higher , however . In the lung there is no substantial increase in NOS2 or arginase-1 or -2 expression until after two days of exposure to hypoxia . The levels of NO metabolites seen in the skin and lung reflect the expression levels of arginase and NOS2 mRNA , with an increase seen in the skin at 24 hr and a subsequent decline to baseline levels after 2 days of hypoxia ( Figure 5D ) . This is in contrast to the lung , which shows a gradual decline in NO metabolites at 48–72 hr ( Figure 5E ) . These data indicate a temporal and tissue-specific shift in the expression of NOS2 and Arg-1/-2 in vivo . To test the hypothesis that keratinocyte HIF-1α/NOS/NO influences shifts in skin temperature , systemic blood pressure and heart rates during exposure to hypoxia , we next generated mice with NOS2 deletions in keratinocytes . Deletion efficiency of epidermal NOS2 in K14cre+ mice was calculated to be greater than 98% in all mice analysed ( Figure 6B ) . The deletion of epidermal NOS2 shows changes in baseline skin temperature ( which is likely correlated with peripheral vascular resistance ) and systemic blood pressures similar to those seen in HIF-2α mutant mice , and initial changes in heart rate similar to those seen in HIF-1α mutant mice . As shown in Figure 6A , epidermal deletion of NOS2 sustains an elevated skin temperature relative to littermate controls for the first 24 hr of hypoxia , before returning to levels seen in control mice for the remainder of the recording ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9K ) . In Figure 6C and D , the similarities to the HIF-2α mutant mice are evident , as the K14-NOS2 mutant animals display a profound hypotensive phenotype , with an apparent decrease in both systolic and diastolic pressures within the first 20 min of hypoxia exposure ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9L ) . This hypotensive state is maintained throughout the hypoxic time course ( Figure 6D ) . Maximal deflection of systolic pressures ( −15 to −20 mmHg ) occurs between 24–48 hr hypoxic exposure when compared to littermate controls ( statistical analysis Figure 9M ) . In contrast , NOS2 mutant heart rate acclimation to hypoxia responds in a similar pattern to the HIF-1α mutants , with a profound increase in BPM 120mins after hypoxia exposure . This is also maintained throughout the first 24 hr of hypoxia exposure ( Figure 6E and F [for statistical analysis see Figure 9N and O] ) . The distinct tensive/cardiac response to hypoxia reported above may be due to a potential compensatory role of NOS1 and NOS3 expression in the skin counteracting the loss of NOS2 . RT-qPCR analysis in whole skin samples identified a significant increase in the expression of both NOS1 and NOS3 in K14cre-NOS2 mice exposed to hypoxia ( 6 hr ) when compared to littermate controls ( Figure 6G ) . The compensatory roles of NOS isoform expression have been previously reported in other animal models of NOS deletion ( Colton et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , comparative analysis of VEGF-A identified no compensatory expression in K14cre-NOS2 mice ( Figure 6H ) . Physical activity is greatly reduced in littermate and mutant animals during the initial 12 hr of hypoxia and slowly recovers between 12–48 hr , although it does not fully recover until the animals are restored to normoxia ( Figure 6I ) . To determine if the complex shifts in skin temperature , blood pressure and heart rate during hypoxia seen in HIF-2α mutant animals were due to HIF-2α regulation of the arginase pathway , we next analysed mice with Arg1 deletions in keratinocytes . As can be seen in Figure 7A , and similarly to what was seen in HIF-2α mutant mice , these animals display an elevated skin temperature relative to littermate control mice during the first twelve hours of hypoxic exposure , followed by a relative decline at 24 hr ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9P ) . In Figure 7B ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9Q ) it is apparent that there is a small increase in systolic and diastolic pressures for the first 10 min hypoxia , followed by a decrease in both systolic and diastolic pressure . This occurs in a manner similar to that of littermate control animals . The recovery of a normotensive state in K14cre-Arg1 mutant mice , is somewhat similar to that seen in littermate controls ( Figure 7C ) ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9R ) . However , the effect on heart rate is similar in some regards to that seen in HIF-2α mutants , with an overall increase relative to the hypoxia-induced decline seen in littermate control animals ( Figure 7D ) ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9S ) , and a more rapid return to the normal pattern of diurnal variation in heart rate ( Figure 7E ) ( for statistical analysis see Figure 9T ) . Metabolic activity of the Arg-1 animals also follows a similar trajectory to that seen in HIF-2α mutant animals . Both VO2 and VCO2 ( Figure 7F–G ) substantially increased between 12 and 48 hr of hypoxia , and this again coincided with heightened physical activity ( Figure 7H ) . In each case , the changes seen in Arg-1 mutants were less striking than those seen in HIF-2α mutants , likely due in part to the presence of Arg-2 in the skin of these animals . These data indicate that a significant aspect of the HIF-2α-mediated changes in the cardiovascular response to hypoxia may be mediated via its regulation of arginase expression . We next questioned whether epidermal deletion of HIFα isoforms influenced the basal or hypoxia-induced ventilatory response . Whole-body plethysmography showed that resting ventilation rates are similar in the HIFα mutant animals relative to littermate controls ( Figure 8A–B ) . All mice responded normally to acute hypoxia by increasing ventilation rates . K14cre-HIF-1α , K14cre-HIF-2α , and wild type littermate control mice increased their respiratory rate for the initial 10 min of hypoxic exposure , before reducing their ventilation rates 30 min after exposure to hypoxia began ( Figure 8A–B ) . Oxygen partial pressures in the blood were not significantly different from those seen in littermate animals during an acute hypoxic challenge ( Figure 8C ) . Likewise , histological examination of the carotid bodies showed that there were no discernable differences in the size or number of oxygen sensing cells in the mutant animals when compared to those of littermate control mice ( Figure 8D–F ) . Figure 8G shows representative photomicrographs of TH+ cells in the carotid bifurcation in littermates and K14cre-HIF-2α mice . Please see Figure 9A-T for graphic depictions of the statistical analyses characterizing these results . 
 We believe that this is the first detailed investigation of cardiovascular acclimatization to hypoxia in mice over the time frames used here . Although there have been a number of previous studies examining cardiovascular hypoxic response , these have either ended after approximately ten minutes of observation and used anaesthesia , or have involved long term exposures , with monitoring after days or weeks of conditioning ( Campen et al . , 2004; Campen et al . , 2005 ) . Here , we monitored animals breathing 10 , 12 , 15 , and 21% FiO2 for 48 hr , followed by a 24 hr recovery period . We found that mice exhibited a well-documented elevation of heart rate and blood pressure for the first ten minutes of exposure to hypoxia ( Campen et al . , 2004; Yu et al . , 1999; Dematteis et al . , 2008; Pearson et al . , 2007 ) , but then , experience a dramatic drop in both parameters . The maximal negative deflection in heart rate and blood pressure was observed at 3 hr post-onset of hypoxic exposure , which coincided with increased peripheral vascular resistance , and very low physical activity . Cardiovascular parameters were approximately restored to normoxic levels over the next 45 hr . These paths of decline and recovery are striking adaptive responses to hypoxia , and they appear to be graded relative to the degree of hypoxic challenge . The processes controlling cardiovascular responses to hypoxia are complex , and include chemoreceptors and baroreceptors as part of an autonomic nervous system reflex . These neurally-mediated responses also interact with , and may frequently mask , local tissue effects of hypoxia on cardiovascular responses , making it difficult to dissociate extrinsic and local tissue responses ( Bärtsch and Gibbs , 2007 ) . We have previously documented that a balance in keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression modulates peripheral vascular resistance ( Boutin et al . , 2008 ) , and that this directly affects murine systemic blood pressure; it is also correlated with the tonic tensive state in mildly hypertensive humans ( Cowburn et al . , 2013 ) . Here we show for the first time that keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression affects the immediate , acute and chronic phases of the cardiovascular response to hypoxia . Hypoxia immediately heightens sympathetic tone in the skin to increase peripheral vascular resistance ( Simmons et al . , 2007; Chalmers and Korner , 1966; Kollai , 1983 ) . Hypoxia also increases nitric oxide release from keratinocytes to stimulate vasodilation and act as a neuromodulator of sympathetic activity , dampening vasoconstriction ( Ramchandra et al . , 2005; Sartori et al . , 2005; Hirooka et al . , 2011 ) . The opposing roles of keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α on nitric oxide synthesis ( Cowburn et al . , 2013 ) would suggest divergent effects on sympathetic activity and blood flow in this highly vascular tissue . Epidermal HIF-1α is shown here to have a direct effect on peripheral vascular resistance and the tonic tensive status of the mouse . The opposite cardiovascular relationship is apparent in the HIF-2α mutant mouse . In the case of the HIF-2α mouse , however , there is a significant increase in heart rate , likely to maintain systolic blood pressure . In this mutant , there appears to be a transition/acclimation checkpoint following 24 hr in hypoxia . The heart rates of both HIF-2α mutant and littermate mice converge at this point , and systolic pressure of the HIF-2α mutant drops below that of controls . This suggests a sustained decrease in the vascular resistance of the skin . Epidermal deletion of arginase-1 in this hypoxia acclimation model phenocopied several characteristics of the K14cre-HIF-2α mutant mouse . There is an overall lessening of the effect , however , indicating that other genes controlled by HIF-2α are likely involved in the hypoxic acclimation process . These alterations in peripheral vascular blood flow also appear to affect whole body metabolism and physical activity during the acclimation phase to hypoxia . Although all four epidermal mutant mice described here demonstrated a similar increase in oxygen consumption during this acclimation phase , only K14cre-HIF-2α and K14cre-arginase-1 mice demonstrated some preservation of physical activity in comparison to wild-type animals . This is intriguing , as it indicates that the response of the peripheral tissue can modulate the animals overall behaviour during environmental stress . Interestingly , the data presented here are consistent with cardiopulmonary investigation of patients with germline , heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in HIF-2α , where baseline heart rate and cardiac responses to moderate hypoxia were shown to be higher in the HIF-2α-gain of function patients when compared to control subjects , suggesting an increase in cardiac sympathetic tone ( Formenti et al . , 2011 ) . In summary , we present here the first dissection of the murine cardiovascular response to hypoxia , and we present evidence that this response is highly influenced by peripheral vascular responses . This indicates that peripheral tissues , and their vascular beds , form a complex physiological network of oxygen-responsive tissues that influence , and are not just influenced by , central regulators of cardiovascular function . This interaction amongst tissues indicates that cardiovascular responses to hypoxia are likely a summation of a range of tissue responses , and not solely dictated by central mediators of cardiovascular activity . 
 All animals were housed in an association and accreditation of laboratory animal care international-approved facility . All protocols and surgical procedures were approved by the UK Home Office and the University of Cambridge Animal Welfare Ethical Review Board ( AWERB ) under project license 80/2565 from the UK Home Office . Targeted deletion of Hif1a ( HIF-1α ) , Epas1 ( HIF-2α ) , Nos2 ( NOS2 ) and Arg1 ( arginase-1 ) in keratinocytes was accomplished by crossing mice ( in a C57/Bl6J background ascertained by extensive backcrossing and SNP analysis ) homozygous for the floxed allele in HIF-1α , HIF-2α , NOS2 or Arginase-1 into a background of Cre recombinase expression driven by the K14 promoter , which is specific to cells of the keratinocyte linage . The NOS2 mouse was generated by Ozgene ( Perth , Aus ) in C57Bl6 embryonic stem cells via homologous recombination , and uses a placement of the loxP sites flanking exons 3 . Cre recombinase-mediated deletion of the loxP-flanked exon introduces a translational frameshift , rendering downstream exons non-functional . All radio-telemetry hardware and software was purchase from Data Science International . ( St Paul , MN , USA ) . All procedures regarding preparation of the transmitter are carried out in aseptic conditions . The regulated procedure describing the aseptic implantation of the radio-telemetry device has previously been described ( Cesarovic et al . , 2011 ) . Data acquisition only commenced following the complete recovery of the animal from the regulated surgical procedure ( at least 10 days ) . All baseline telemetry data was collected over a 96 hr period in a designated quiet room to ensure accurate and repeatable results . Radio-telemetry/hypoxia challenge was conducted in combination with Oxymax Lab animal monitoring system ( CLAMS ) ( Columbus Instruments , Columbus , OH , USA ) . Mice were placed in environmental chambers and allowed to acclimate for 24 hr before the oxygen content of the flow gas was reduced to 10% . The mice were continuously monitored for the next 48 hr before being returned to normal atmospheric oxygen for a further 24 hr . Carotid body histology was performed as previously reported ( Macías et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , carotid bifurcations were dissected , fixed for 2 hr with 4% paraformaldehyde ( Santa Cruz ) and cryopreserved with 30% sucrose in PBS . 10 μm-thick cryosections were obtained ( Bright cryostat ) and tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) positive cells were detected by immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-TH antibody ( Novus bioscience ref: 300–109 ) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa568 antibody ( Life technologies ref: A11036 ) . Carotid body volume and cell numbers were quantified on microscope images ( Leica DM-RB ) using ImageJ software . A single chamber plethysmograph ( Data Science ) was used in conjunction with a pressure transducer . This utilises the barometric analysis technique that compares the pressure difference between the animal chamber and a reference chamber to measure airway physiological parameters . Unanesthetized mice were randomly placed into the plethysmograph and allowed to acclimate . Baseline averages of breathing frequency , tidal volume , inspiration and expiration volumes/times were recorded . Once acclimated to the chamber , the composition of the flow gas was switched from 21% O2 to 10% O2 using a PEGAS mixer ( Columbus instruments ) . The mice were housed in the reduced oxygen environment for 60 min before being returned to atmospheric oxygen . Blood samples were centrifuged to separate plasma and were passed through a column with a 10 kDa cut-off filter . All samples were analysed for total NO ( X ) content using a NOA 280i ( Siever , GE Healthcare ) according to the manufacturers instructions . The preparation of primary keratinocytes from adult mouse tail skin is comprehensively described by Lichti et al . ( 2008 ) . Total RNA was isolated from skin using TRI-reagent ( Sigma ) , followed by RNA clean-up and DNase digest using RNeasy column kits ( Qiagen , Manchester , UK ) . First-strand synthesis was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using a high-capacity cDNA kit ( Applied Biosystems , Paisley , UK ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Relative gene expression was determined by qPCR ( ABI system , Applied Biosystems ) and amplified in Sybr-green master mix ( Roche ) using relevant primers from Qiagen . Deletion efficiency was characterised for NOS2 in the K14cre+ mouse using DNA isolated from skin samples using TRIzol/DNeasy columns ( Qiagen , Manchester . UK ) . The PCR primers and Taqman probe were designed in-house and synthesised by Sigma ( Gillingham UK ) fwd 5’-TCCAGAATCCCTGGACAAG rev 5’-TGGTGAAGAGTGTCATGCAA , probe 5’-FAM-TGTGACATCGACCCGTCCACA . Energy expenditure of the K14cre mice and their littermate controls was measured using the Columbus Instruments Oxymax system according to the manufacturers instructions ( Cowburn et al . , 2013 ) . Surface temperatures were measured with a FLIR Thermovision A20 thermal infrared camera , and image data were analyzed using FLIR image analysis software Baseline radiotelemetry parameters in Figure 1 were analysed by determining the area under curved for each mouse per group and then performing a mann-Whitney test to determine the statistical difference across groups compared to littermate . Mann-Whitney test was used to analyse RT-qPCR gene expression and plasma/tissue nitrate data in Figure 5 . Non-linear regression modelling , using a least squares method , was used to model the radio-telemetry data in Figures 3 , 4 , 6 and 7 Akaike’s informative Criteria ( AICc ) was used to compare models , and determine whether the data were best represented by a single model , or by separate ones . Analysis was undertaken using GraphPad Prism Version 7 . 0 c for Mac OS .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials\xa0and\xa0methods']",['medicine'],elife-28755-v1,273,6744,6471,24.703296703296704

However , mounting an immune response to a bacterial infection requires a lot of energy . It also can be potentially dangerous if the immune system becomes too active . Therefore , avoiding bacteria and not getting infected to begin with may be a better strategy to stay healthy . Fruit flies , like humans , can detect dangerous substances in the environment via their sense of smell , but it is not known whether they also detect disease-causing organisms through their sense of taste . Bacterial molecules called lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) can alert the immune system to the presence of dangerous bacteria . Previous studies have found that when flies get in contact with LPS they begin cleaning themselves , which might help prevent infection . However it was not clear how the flies actually detected the LPS . Now , Soldano et al . show that fruit flies can taste LPS and avoid eating or laying eggs on food contaminated with LPS and bacteria . A series of experiments showed that when a fly tastes LPS it stimulates bitter-sensing neurons in the fly’s mouth and throat . The experiments also revealed that the protein that activates these neurons in response to LPS is the same protein that acts in humans as detector of pungent chemicals contained in ordinary food items like mustard , garlic and wasabi . This suggests this protein , called TRPA1 , is part of a key survival mechanism that has been preserved in many species throughout evolution . Soldano et al . showed that a fly’s senses and nervous system are actively involved in protecting it from bacterial infection . This is particularly important to flies , because unlike humans they don’t develop resistance to future infections with the same bacteria . Future studies are needed to determine if flies use their sense of taste to detect other chemicals that are signs of infections . Additionally , studies are needed to determine if the activated bitter-sensing nerves alert the fly’s immune system to a potential infection .","Detecting pathogens and mounting immune responses upon infection is crucial for animal health . However , these responses come at a high metabolic price ( McKean and Lazzaro , 2011 , Kominsky et al . , 2010 ) , and avoiding pathogens before infection may be advantageous . The bacterial endotoxins lipopolysaccharides ( LPS ) are important immune system infection cues ( Abbas et al . , 2014 ) , but it remains unknown whether animals possess sensory mechanisms to detect them prior to infection . Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster display strong aversive responses to LPS and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors mediate avoidance of LPS in feeding and egg laying assays . We found the expression of the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1 in these cells to be necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance . Furthermore , LPS stimulates Drosophila neurons in a TRPA1-dependent manner and activates exogenous dTRPA1 channels in human cells . Our findings demonstrate that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TRPA1 activation as conserved molecular mechanism . 
 In the past decade , increasing attention has been paid to the interactions between the immune and nervous systems ( McMahon et al . , 2015 ) . In particular , there is evidence that sensory neurons can directly detect bacterial components as potentially damaging stimuli , and initiate acute inflammatory and nocifensive responses ( Chiu et al . , 2013; Meseguer et al . , 2014 ) . It has been shown that the Gram-negative bacterial wall component LPS induces hygienic grooming in Drosophila , an important behavioral defense against pathogens , via contact chemosensation ( Yanagawa et al . , 2014 ) . Thus , LPS may represent important sensory cues of food contamination with Gram-negative bacteria . To test whether LPS can be perceived by flies during food ingestion we used a binary food choice assay ( Isono and Morita , 2010 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . We found that control flies displayed significant avoidance towards food supplemented with LPS ( Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . Because LPS is non-volatile we determined if this avoidance is mediated by gustatory neurons known to detect aversive compounds ( Gr66a ) ( Marella et al . , 2006 ) . Blocking neurotransmission in these neurons by expressing the light chain of tetanus toxin ( TNT ) abolished avoidance of LPS ( Figure 1B ) , indicating that flies can detect LPS through a gustatory mechanism . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13133 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13133 . 004 A subset of Gr66a neurons innervating the labral sense organ and the labellum express TRPA1 ( Kim et al . , 2010; Kang et al . , 2011 ) , a chemosensory cation channel ( Story et al . , 2003; Nilius et al . , 2012; Zygmunt and Högestätt , 2014 ) that mediates acute nocifensive responses to LPS in mice ( Meseguer et al . , 2014 ) and avoidance of bitter and noxious compounds in Drosophila ( Kim et al . , 2010; Kang et al . , 2010; Du et al . , 2015 ) . We tested whether TRPA1 mediates gustatory avoidance of LPS in flies . We found that loss of dTrpA1 ( w1118;dTrpA11 , Figure 1C and dTrpA11/dTrpA1ins , Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) and pan-neuronal dTrpA1 knockdown by two independent RNAi lines ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1D ) lead to impaired avoidance of LPS . Therefore , neuronal expression of dTrpA1 is required for LPS avoidance . Furthermore , Gr66a-specific knockdown of dTrpA1 abolished the LPS-induced behavior ( Figure 1D ) , and restoration of dTrpA1 expression using either of two different dTrpA1 isoforms ( A and B ) in the entire dTrpA1 pattern or only in Gr66a gustatory neurons of dTrpA11/dTrpA1ins flies rescued the avoidance of LPS ( Figure 1E ) . Female flies use gustatory detection of non-volatile compounds via Gr66a neurons to select oviposition sites ( Joseph and Heberlein , 2012 ) . In a binary oviposition choice assay control females showed preference for control food over food supplemented with LPS ( Figure 2A ) . This behavior was lost in dTrpA1-/- flies ( Figure 2A ) , upon silencing Gr66a-expressing neurons ( Figure 2B ) , and in Gr66a-specific dTrpA1 knockdown flies ( Figure 2C ) . Altogether , these data show that LPS is avoided during feeding and oviposition and that dTrpA1 expression in bitter-sensing gustatory neurons is necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance . These data indicate that a TRPA1-dependent mechanism of avoidance of LPS may serve flies to prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria . Indeed , we found that control animals , but not dTrpA1-/- mutants , preferred laying eggs on control food , rather than on food contaminated with E . coli ( Figure 2D ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13133 . 005Figure 2 . dTrpA1 expression in gustatory neurons is required for avoidance of LPS during oviposition .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13133 . 005 dTRPA1 is expressed in the mouthpart in a subset of gustatory neurons in the esophagus ( Figure 3A , B and Kang et al . , 2010 ) and in a few neurons in the labellum that also express Gr66a ( data not shown and Kang et al . , 2011 ) . However , no co-localization between dTrpA1 and Gr66a was observed in the leg ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . To test whether avoidance of LPS is mediated by labellar or esophageal chemosensors we performed a proboscis extension reflex ( PER ) assay in wild type animals . LPS did not inhibit PER ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) , suggesting that avoidance of LPS is not mediated by the labellar neurons , but by the gustatory neurons of the esophagus . We attempted to record neuronal responses in these neurons using flies expressing the genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6m in Gr66a neurons but Ca2+ imaging access to these neurons proved impossible in our assays . Next , we attempted direct brain stimulation . All preparations ( 5/5 ) responded robustly to the application of the dTRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate ( AITC ) or the classical bitter compound caffeine , indicating that they were healthy . However , application of LPS gave varying results ( small responses in 40% ( 2/5 ) of the flies; data not shown ) precluding definitive conclusions . Therefore , in order to further test whether dTRPA1 mediates responses to LPS in vivo we monitored intracellular Ca2+ dynamics in the ventral nerve cord of larvae , a preparation that allows better accessibility of chemical stimuli . Application of LPS or the dTRPA1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate ( AITC ) induced robust Ca2+ responses , effects that were strongly reduced by incubation with the TRPA1 inhibitor HC030031 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . In contrast , HC030031 did not affect the responses to a depolarizing solution containing high K+ concentration . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13133 . 006Figure 3 . dTrpA1 is expressed in a subset of Gr66a-expressing neurons that can be directly stimulated by LPS .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13133 . 008 To test the role of TRPA1 in neuronal responses to LPS at the cellular level we examined primary cultures of larva brain neurons ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 , Harzer et al . , 2013 ) expressing the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP5 under the control of dTrpA1Gal4 . LPS ( 30 µg/ml ) reversibly stimulated more than 40% of neurons isolated from control larvae ( 122/289 ) , and 80% of these were also activated by the dTRPA1 agonist N-ethyl maleimide ( NEM , 300 µM ) ( Kim and Cavanaugh , 2007 ) ( Figure 4A , B ) . Notably , the proportion of neurons responding to both agents was strongly reduced in cultures derived from dTrpA11 null animals ( 20/153 , P < 10–4 , Fisher exact test ) , as well as by pharmacological inhibition of dTRPA1 with HC030031 in neurons isolated from control animals ( 4/32 , P < 10–3 , Fisher exact test ) . Intriguingly , the responses to LPS or NEM were not fully abolished by genetic or pharmacological ablation of dTRPA1 . This suggests that dTRPA1 mediates some , though not all , Ca2+ responses of larva brain neurons to these compounds . To verify this indication in other experimental settings we evaluated the responses of cells isolated from brains of wild type larvae using the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator Fura2 , and AITC as reference TRPA1 agonist . Application of LPS ( 60 µg/ml ) reversibly stimulated more than 70% ( 39/54 ) of neurons isolated from control larvae ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3A , E , F ) . A large proportion of LPS-sensitive neurons ( 23/39 , 59% ) were also activated by 100 µM AITC ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3A , E ) , which indicates that LPS stimulates cells functionally expressing dTRPA1 channels . No Ca2+ response was observed when LPS was applied in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ ( 0/14 , P < 10–4 , Fisher exact test; Figure 4—figure supplement 3B , E , F ) . This indicates that LPS-induced responses result from Ca2+ influx through channels in the plasma membrane , rather than from release from intracellular stores . To directly assess whether LPS induces neuronal responses through the activation of dTRPA1 , we tested its effects on wild type neurons in the presence of HC030031 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3C ) . In these experiments , LPS-induced responses were significantly less frequent ( 9/32 , 28% , P < 10–3 , Fisher exact test , Figure 4—figure supplement 3E ) and smaller in amplitude ( P < 10–3 , Mann-Whitney U test , Figure 4—figure supplement 3F ) than in control experiments . To confirm these data genetically , we tested the effects of LPS on neurons isolated from dTrpA1-null larvae . These cells responded to LPS with significantly lower frequency ( 5/23 , 22% , P < 10–4 , Fisher exact test , Figure 4—figure supplement 3D , E ) and amplitude ( P < 10–4 , Mann-Whitney U test , Figure 4—figure supplement 3F ) than control neurons . Importantly , the subpopulation of neurons responsive to both LPS and AITC in cultures from control larvae was absent in cultures from dTrpA1-null animals ( Figure 4—figure supplement 3E ) . Taken together , these data indicate that dTRPA1 channels expressed in the plasma membrane mediate at least part of the Ca2+ influx triggered by stimulation with in Drosophila neurons . Interestingly , as for the experiments with NEM , neither the LPS- nor the AITC-induced responses were fully absent in TrpA1-null neurons . This demonstrates that receptors other than TRPA1 may be also sensitive to these compounds in cultured brain neurons . This is in line with previous reports showing that sensory neurons isolated from Trpa1 knockout mice showed reduced , but not completely abrogated responses to LPS ( Meseguer et al . , 2014 ) , and that TRPA1 is not the only target of electrophilic compounds in sensory neurons ( Alpizar et al . , 2014; Everaerts et al . , 2011; Gees et al . , 2013; Ohta et al . , 2007; Salazar et al . , 2008 ) . Here it is important to note that we used the larval fillet preparation and the neuron cultures as experimental models for native functional expression of dTRPA1 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13133 . 009Figure 4 .

( C ) Percentage of cells responding to LPS . In each experiment , non-transfected and transfected cells were identified by their unresponsiveness or responsiveness to the dTRPA1 agonist AITC . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13133 . 013 Finally , we determined whether dTRPA1 can be activated by LPS in the HEK293T heterologous expression system . We found that 60 µg/ml LPS induced only very few responses in non-transfected cells ( 7/110 ) , but stimulated a significantly larger fraction of cells transiently transfected with dTRPA1-A ( 42/74 , P < 10–4 , Fisher exact test ) or dTRPA1-B ( 14/67 , P = 0 . 007 , Fisher exact test ) ( Figure 4—figure supplement 4 ) . These responses were more variable in amplitude and less frequent than those triggered by AITC , indicating that LPS is a relatively weak agonist of dTRPA1 channels ( Alpizar et al . , 2013 ) . Further evidence for dTRPA1 activation by LPS was obtained in whole-cell patch-clamp experiments , in which application of LPS significantly enhanced both outward and inward currents in dTRPA1-A transfected HEK293T cells , but not control cells ( Figure 4C , D ) . Application of HC030031 reduced the amplitude of currents recorded in the presence of LPS ( 35 ± 4% at -75 mV , n = 6 , Figure 4C ) , further confirming the TRPA1-dependence of these responses . Previous results suggest that LPS activates mouse TRPA1 channels by inducing mechanical perturbations in the plasma membrane upon insertion of the lipophilic moiety of the molecule ( Meseguer et al . , 2014 ) . It is conceivable that LPS activates dTRPA1 channels via the same mechanism , but additional experiments are required to verify this . Taken together , our data demonstrate that fruit flies possess a gustatory mechanism underlying the detection and avoidance of LPS . The avoidance of LPS-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may serve to prevent Gram-negative bacterial infections , potentially compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals . The fact that this sensory mechanism exploits dTRPA1 suggests a broadly conserved principle whereby these channels play a crucial role in LPS detection by sensory neurons in flies and mammals , regardless of the particular sensory modality involved . Our findings , together with previous evidence of an olfactory-based detection of secondary metabolites of Gram-positive bacteria ( Stensmyr et al . , 2012 ) , underscore the need to consider the function of the sensory nervous system as a crucial part of a broad mechanistic understanding of pathogen-host interactions . 
 Drosophila melanogaster strains were raised on standard cornmeal/agar medium supplemented with dry yeast at 25 °C with a 12 hr light/dark cycle . The wild type stock was a w1118strain . The following stocks were obtained from Bloomington Stock Center: w1118;dTrpA11 ( BL26504 ) , dTrpA1 RNAi1 ( BL31384 ) , w*;dTrpA11 , dTrpA1-Gal4 ( BL36922 ) , w*; dTrpA1-Gal4 ( BL 27593 ) , UAS-RFP ( BL 27391 ) , UAS-GCaMP5 ( BL 42037 ) , UAS-GCaMP6m ( BL 42748 ) . The Gr66a-IRES-GFP vector was kindly provided by Kristin Scott , the NSyB-Gal4;UAS-GCaMP3 was obtained by Patrick Verstreken . The lines Gr66aGal4 , UAS-dTrpA1 ( A ) ;dTrpA1ins , dTrpA1GAL4 , UAS-dTrpA1 ( B ) ;dTrpA1ins , dTrpA1Gal4 and the dTrpA1 RNAi 2 were kindly provided by the laboratory of Paul Garrity . Groups of 20–30 adult males ( 2–7 days old ) were starved for 20 hr in plastic tubes provided with humidified filter paper . After starvation , the animals were allowed to feed on a microtiter dish containing wells alternating 100 mM sucrose alone or with 1 mg/ml LPS , mixed with either a red or blue dye ( Supplementary Figure 1 , left ) . This concentration of LPS was chosen in accordance with a previous study reporting concentrations between 250 and 800 µg/ml in water used to rinse fruits and vegetables contaminated with E . coli ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) . The concentrations in the surface of the food would be therefore much higher than these values , and hence the concentration of 1 mg/ml is likely to be relevant for real scenarios . The feeding preference was assessed by examining the colors of the abdomen and by classifying the flies as red , blue or purple ( Supplementary Figure 1 , right ) . The preference index ( PI ) for the control-containing solutions was calculated as: ( nControl - nTest ) / ( nControl + nTest ) , where nControl and nTest are the number of flies that ate the control solution ( in red or blue color ) and the test solution ( containing control or LPS , both in red or blue color ) , respectively . The test solutions were colored with food dyes that showed comparable results: red ( food dye or Sulforhodamine B sodium salt , 1 mg/ml ) and blue ( food dye or Erioglaucine disodium salt , 0 . 16 mg/ml ) . Preference data was always represented in box charts in which lines and the dots inside the boxes represent the median and the mean of the data , respectively . Adult flies were allowed to mate for 48 hr prior to test . Males were subsequently discarded and females were transferred to a test tube on top of a 35 mm dish containing food . The food was covered on one side with control solution ( water ) and on the other side with test solution . The test solution consisted of either E . coli or 1 mg/ml LPS in water . The flies were allowed to lay eggs for 20 hr at 25 °C in a light-proof chamber , after which the amount of eggs on each side of the plate was counted . A preference index ( PI ) for laying eggs in the control side was calculated as: ( nControlSide - nOtherSide ) / ( nControlSide + nOtherSide ) , where nControl and nOtherSide are the number of eggs laid in the control and in the other side ( containing control , E . coli or LPS ) , respectively . Two to seven day old flies were starved overnight on wet wipes , anaesthetized on ice , and gently pushed into a pipette tip . The flies were positioned with the head and the proboscis protruding outside the tip edge and the body immobilized within the tip . Flies recovered for 5–10 min before the test and then satiated with water . The solutions were presented as a liquid drop on a syringe tip and the proboscis was touched with the drop for 5 consequent times . During the assay flies were first stimulated with water , to exclude that any response would be due to thirst , and subsequently with 100 mM sucrose alone , as positive control , 100 mM sucrose + 1 mg/ml LPS and finally with 100 mM sucrose again . The extension frequency was calculated as mean frequency of all the samples ( n = 19 animals ) . For each experiment , a fly was secured to an aluminum chamber with wax . The antennae and the surrounding cuticle were removed . The brain was immerged into a bath containing adult hemolymph-like ( AHL ) solution . The proboscis was partially severed to allow easier penetration of the chemicals . The sub-esophageal ganglion was imaged in vivo from the dorsal side while constantly perfusing the brain with oxygenated AHL saline . The saline containing ( in mM ) : 108 NaCl , 5 KCl , 2 CaCl2 , 8 . 2 MgCl2 , 4 NaHCO3 , 1 NaH2PO4 , 5 trehalose , 15 ribose , 5 HEPES ( pH 7 . 3 ) . GCaMP fluorescence was imaged at 4 Hz using an EMCCD camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics ) installed on an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope ( Olympus Corporation ) . In vivo intracellular Ca2+ imaging was performed in larvae fillets , consisting on surgically exposed brains and ventral nerve cords of wandering third instar larvae . Briefly , larvae were immobilized using pins and stretched out lengthwise in a dish coated with silica and filled with a HL3 solution containing ( in mM ) : 70 NaCl , 5 KCl , 20 MgCl2 , 10 NaHCO3 , 5 trehalose , 115 sucrose and 5 HEPES ( pH 7 . 3 ) . The larval skin was cut vertically along the dorsal midline towards the rostral end of the larva using spring scissors . At the rostrum of the animal horizontal incisions were made to the left and right . This created a left and a right flap in the body wall . These flaps were then pulled and pinned on the side of the larva to better expose the brain . The organs were removed with forceps and the preparation was immediately used for imaging . Intracellular Ca2+ imaging was performed using a monochromator-based system consisting of a Polychrome V monochromator ( TILL Photonics GmbH , Germany ) , an upright microscope ( Olympus , U-TV1X-2 , Japan ) and a 10X water immersion objective . Images were obtained with an iXon3 888 ( Andor , Germany ) camera controlled by LiveAcquisition software ( TILL Photonics GmbH , Germany ) . The bath temperature was controlled by a SC-20 dual in-line heater/cooler ( Warner Instruments , USA ) and an Objective Heater® System ( Bioptech , USA ) . The data were classified semi-automatically using a function programmed in MATLAB ( MathWorks , MA ) and analyzed with Origin 7 . 0 ( OriginLab Corporation , Northamptom , MA , USA ) . Primary neuronal cultures were obtained by dissection of the brain complex of third instar larvae , as described elsewhere ( Harzer et al . , 2013 ) . Dissociated neurons were plated as a 50 µl drop in the center of a coverslip previously coated with a poly-D-lysine/laminin solution . Approximately 40 larvae were dissociated to seed 10 coverslips . Primary neurons were allowed to attach on a coverslip for 2 hr at 25 °C after dissociation . Imaging experiments were performed 3 hr after seeding the cells . Primary neurons in coverslips were washed three times with PBS and subsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) for 20 min . After 10 min incubation with 0 . 1 M glycine , the cells were permeabilize with 0 . 1% Triton X-100 , followed by 20 min incubation with 3% BSA to reduce unspecific protein bindings . Neuronal subset was stained using a rat anti-Elav ( Molecular Probes , 1 hr , dilution 1:100 ) , followed by 30 min incubation with a donkey anti-rat Alexa 488 antibody . Three washes with PBS were used to rinsed cells during all experimental steps described during fixation , permeabilization and staining . After immunostaining coverslips were covered with Vectashield mounting medium ( Vector Labs ) and imaged on an A1-R confocal ( Nikon ) mounted on a Ti-2000 inverted microscope ( Nikon ) . The images were processed using ImageJ . Experiments were performed at 25 °C using a standard Krebs solution containing ( in mM ) : 150 NaCl , 6 KCl , 1 MgCl2 , 1 . 5 CaCl2 , 10 glucose , 10 HEPES and titrated to pH 7 . 4 . In experiments on cells expressing GCaMP5 the fluorescence was measured during excitation at 488 nm using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope ( Nikon ) and the NIS Elements 4 . 30 software . In experiments on cells isolated from wild type flies we used Fura2 as Ca2+ indicator . Neurons were functionally identified at the end of each experiment by their responsiveness to the application of an extracellular solution containing high K+ concentration . The data were classified semi-automatically using a function programmed in MATLAB ( MathWorks , MA ) and analyzed with Origin 7 . 0 ( OriginLab Corporation , Northamptom , MA , USA ) . For the proboscis staining adult heads were dissected in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and fixed in 3 . 7% formaldehyde in PBT ( PBS + TritonX100 0 . 1% ) for 15 min . The samples were subsequently rinsed three times in PBT and the proboscis were detached from the heads before being blocked in PAX-DG for 1 hr . Following these steps , the samples were incubated with mouse anti-GFP ( Roche ) and rabbit anti-dsRED ( Clonetech ) diluted in PAX-DG overnight at 4 °C . This incubation was followed by three washes with PBT and a subsequent incubation with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies for 2 hr at 25 °C . After three rinses in PBT , the proboscis were transferred in 50% Glycerol diluted in PBS and then mounted in Vectashield ( Vector Labs ) mounting medium . For the legs staining the procedure was modified as follows . Flies were fixed in 3 . 7% formaldehyde in PBT ( PBS + TritonX100 3% ) for 4 hr , then subsequently rinsed three times in PBT . The legs were then separated from the body and left O/N in the fixing solution . Human embryonic kidney cells , HEK293T , were seeded on 18 mm glass coverslips coated with poly-L-lysine ( 0 . 1 mg/ml ) and grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium containing 10% ( v/v ) fetal calf serum , 2 mM L-glutamine , 2 U/ml penicillin and 2 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidity controlled incubator with 10% CO2 . Cells were transiently transfected using Trans-IT-293 reagents ( Mirus , Madison , MI , USA ) with dTRPA1-A or dTRPA1-B ( kindly provided by Paul Garrity ) cloned into the pCAGGSM2-IRES-GFP vector . For intracellular Ca2+ imaging experiments cells were incubated at 37 °C with 2 µM Fura2-AM ester for 30 min before the recordings . Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured on an Olympus Cell^M system at 23 °C . Fluorescence was measured during excitation at 340 and 380 nm , and after correction for the individual background fluorescence signals , the ratio of the fluorescence at both excitation wavelengths ( F340/F380 ) was monitored . In all experiments transfected cells were identified by GFP expression and sensitivity to the TRPA1 agonist AITC . Whole-cell membrane currents were measured at 23 °C with an EPC-10 patch-clamp amplifier and the softwares Pulse ( HEKA , Lambrecht/Pfalz , Germany ) and Clampex ( Axon Instruments , Sunnyvale CA , US ) . Currents were digitally filtered at 2 . 9 kHz , acquired 20 kHz and stored for off-line analysis on a personal computer . Cells were recorded in an extracellular solution containing ( in mM ) : 140 NaCl , 5 KCl , 10 HEPES , 2 CaCl2 , 2 MgCl2 , 10 glucose , pH titrated to 7 . 4 with NaOH . The pipette solution contained ( in mM ) : 120 Cs-Aspartate , 5 EGTA , 10 HEPES , 1 MgCl2 , pH titrated to 7 . 4 with CsOH . Non-transfected HEK cells were used as control . Whole-cell currents were elicited using a 200 ms voltage ramp from -110 mV to +110 mV every 2 s from a holding potential of -40 mV . NMDG+ ( N-methyl-D-glucamine ) was used to monitor the size of the leak currents during the patch-clamp recordings ( Meseguer et al . , 2011 ) . Electrophysiological data were analyzed using WinASCD software ( Guy Droogmans , KU Leuven ) and Origin ( OriginLab Corporation , Northamptom , MA , USA ) . Origin was also used for statistical analysis and data display . We used LPS extracted from E . coli , strains 055:B5 and 0127:B8 . AITC was kept at 4 °C as a 100 mM stock solution in ethanol and fresh dilutions were prepared daily . All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich ( Bornem , Belgium ) .","['Abstract', 'Results and discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['short report', 'neuroscience']",elife-13133-v1,186,6227,6041,33.47849462365591

It occurs when the neurons that control muscles – the motoneurons – disconnect from their target muscles and die . This causes the muscles to weaken and waste away . More and more muscles become affected over time until eventually the muscles that control breathing also become paralyzed . Most patients die within two to five years of diagnosis . Motoneurons consist of a cell body plus a cable-like structure called the axon . The cell body of each motoneuron sits within the spinal cord , and the axon extends out of the spinal cord to the motoneuron’s target muscle . Within the muscle the axon divides into branches , each of which connects with multiple muscle fibers . The breakdown of these connections , known as neuromuscular junctions , is one of the first signs of ALS . Does a motoneuron lose all of its connections with muscle fibers at once , or do the connections break down a few at a time ? This distinction is important as it will help to identify the events that lead to muscle paralysis in ALS . To find out , Martineau et al . studied mice that had two genetic mutations: one that causes ALS and another that produces fluorescent molecules in some motoneurons . This allowed the branches of the motoneurons to be tracked over time with a fluorescence microscope . Martineau et al . found that individual neurons lose their connections to muscle fibers gradually . Moreover , motoneurons grow new branches and form new connections even while losing their old ones . This dual process of pruning and budding lasts for several weeks , until eventually the motoneuron dies . Developing drugs to stabilize neuromuscular junctions during the period when motoneurons gradually disconnect from muscles could be a promising avenue to explore to improve the quality of life of ALS patients . One advantage of this treatment strategy is that neuromuscular junctions in muscles are easier to access than motoneurons inside the spinal cord . To identify potential drugs , future studies will need to focus on the proteins and signals that cause the neuromuscular junctions to break down .","Despite being an early event in ALS , it remains unclear whether the denervation of neuromuscular junctions ( NMJ ) is simply the first manifestation of a globally degenerating motor neuron . Using in vivo imaging of single axons and their NMJs over a three-month period , we identify that single motor-units are dismantled asynchronously in SOD1G37R mice . We reveal that weeks prior to complete axonal degeneration , the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto nearby NMJs . Denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ , consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons , with distal branches being more susceptible . These results show that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration . 
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by upper and lower motor neuron ( MN ) loss . Loss of neuromuscular junctions ( NMJs ) is a key pathological event in ALS patients ( Fischer et al . , 2004; Killian et al . , 1994 ) and in animal models of the disease ( Clark et al . , 2016; Fischer et al . , 2004; Frey et al . , 2000; Pun et al . , 2006; Tallon et al . , 2016 ) . Denervation of NMJs is observed prior to symptom onset ( Clark et al . , 2016; Fischer et al . , 2004; Pun et al . , 2006; Tallon et al . , 2016; Vinsant et al . , 2013 ) and before any significant MN axonal or cell body loss ( Fischer et al . , 2004; Vinsant et al . , 2013 ) . However , whether early NMJ denervation arises from local branch-specific degeneration ( ‘dying-back hypothesis’ ) or is merely the manifestation of a diseased and globally degenerating motor neuron remains ill-defined . There is considerable evidence which suggests that a subset of degenerating motor-units ( MU , a motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates ) swiftly lose their NMJs while a distinct , yet unaffected , population compensates via axonal sprouting ( Pun et al . , 2006; Schaefer et al . , 2005 ) , somewhat akin to a nerve injury . Indeed , NMJs innervated by fast-fatigable MNs are lost early , followed by fast-fatigue resistant and slow MNs ( Frey et al . , 2000; Pun et al . , 2006 ) . This is further supported by electromyographic ( EMG ) recordings showing that the number of MUs declines in parallel with muscle strength ( Azzouz et al . , 1997; Dantes and McComas , 1991; Hegedus et al . , 2007; Hegedus et al . , 2008; Kennel et al . , 1996; McComas et al . , 1971 ) and that surviving MUs increase in size in animal models and in patients ( Dantes and McComas , 1991; Dengler et al . , 1990; McComas et al . , 1971; Schmied et al . , 1999 ) . Taken together , these results strongly suggest that the loss of NMJs within a single MU is a dichotomous and mostly synchronous event and that local synaptic events have a limited impact on the denervation process . Under this monotonic paradigm , degenerating MUs are irrevocably caught in a degenerative cascade while surviving MUs attempt to compensate , consequently undermining the relevance of the NMJ as a disease-modifying therapeutic target . However , the rescue of neuronal loss in SOD1 mice does not necessarily improve NMJ denervation ( Gould et al . , 2006; Parone et al . , 2013; Suzuki et al . , 2007 ) suggesting that local branch-specific events may play a key role in NMJ denervation . In ALS , local alterations of synaptic function and molecular signaling take place very early at the NMJ ( Arbour et al . , 2015; De Winter et al . , 2006; Jokic et al . , 2006; Rocha et al . , 2013; Taetzsch et al . , 2017; Tremblay et al . , 2017 ) , implying that local , MU-independent , structural changes could occur . Finally , ALS is a non-cell autonomous disease where cell types other than motor neurons contribute to the disease pathogenesis ( Boillée et al . , 2006a; Ilieva et al . , 2009 ) . Contribution of various cell types known to interact with NMJs and motor axons has been suggested ( Arbour et al . , 2015; Chiu et al . , 2009; Keller et al . , 2009; Lobsiger et al . , 2009; Loeffler et al . , 2016; Nardo et al . , 2016; Turner et al . , 2010; Wang et al . , 2012 ) , which could contribute to NMJ loss . In this scenario , asynchronous branch-specific synaptic changes would take place over time within single MUs . Altogether , these divergent paradigms highlight that the precise sequence of events taking place at the NMJ in ALS remains ill-defined . From a therapeutic viewpoint , this distinction is of high importance since it could pinpoint the NMJ as an accessible target that can be exploited within a time window between the onset of structural changes and the global degeneration of the MU , as previously suggested ( Cantor et al . , 2018; Miyoshi et al . , 2017; Pérez-García and Burden , 2012 ) . Here , we used longitudinal repeated in vivo imaging of single motor neuron axonal arbors and their NMJs to directly assess the time course and dynamics of structural changes during ALS progression . We predict that a MU-dependent mechanism would result in the more or less synchronous degeneration of the whole MU over a brief period , while a contribution of local neuromuscular changes would result in the asynchronous loss of NMJs within a single MU . 
 SOD1G37R mice ( loxSOD1G37R ) are well known for their slow disease progression , making it an ideal model to follow single MU changes over time ( Boillée et al . , 2006b; Lobsiger et al . , 2009 ) . To visualize and follow single MUs in control and ALS mice , we crossed SOD1G37R mice to animals expressing a cytoplasmic fluorescent marker in a small random subset of MNs ( Thy1-YFP line H , Figure 1A ) ( Feng et al . , 2000 ) . Repeated in vivo imaging was performed on the Tibialis anterior muscle since numerous NMJs can be observed near the surface when exposed following a minimally invasive surgery ( WT/YFP: N = 5; SOD1G37R/YFP: N = 11 ) . Postsynaptic sites were identified in vivo by staining nicotinic receptors ( nAChR ) with fluorescently labeled α-bungarotoxin ( Li et al . , 2011; Turney et al . , 2012 ) . Except for two cases ( animal #23 and #21 ) , all imaging sessions were performed at two--week intervals for up to 5–6 sessions ( 56–76 days ) . The same MU arbor ( axon and its NMJs ) was identified on every imaging session through the unique ‘pretzel’ shape of its NMJs , the branching pattern of the motor axon , and the position of nearby postsynaptic sites ( Figure 1A , landmarks , Δ , * , ● ) . NMJs were classified based on their innervation status over time ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . We first confirmed that the same MU arbor and its NMJs were reliably imaged over several weeks without inducing any structural damage . We followed single MUs in WT/YFP animals and found that YFP-labeled axons stayed precisely overlapped with nAChR-rich postsynaptic sites over all imaging sessions performed ( 36/36 NMJs , 5/5 MU arbors , N = 5; Figure 1C ) . Importantly , very few changes in axonal branching pattern , postsynaptic nAChRs and presynaptic nerve terminal organization were observed . Consistent with previous reports ( Balice-Gordon and Lichtman , 1990; Li et al . , 2011; Schaefer et al . , 2005; Turney et al . , 2012 ) , our results show that NMJs of WT mice remained innervated by the same MU and were very stable over long periods of time . We next performed imaging in symptomatic SOD1G37R/YFP animals ( all animals at or past disease onset ) to investigate whether the pattern of NMJ denervation in ALS mice was synchronous or asynchronous . Of note , SOD1G37R/YFP mice were phenotypically and histologically indistinguishable from SOD1G37R mice ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , showing that YFP expression did not alter the disease course and that YFP-expressing MNs are not more susceptible to the disease . We found that YFP-labeled nerve terminals gradually retracted from some nAChR-rich postsynaptic sites ( Figure 2A–C , for example , NMJ A1 , A3 , A4 ) while other axonal branches remained perfectly overlapped ( e . g . NMJ A2 ) . Some NMJs were even re-innervated by the MU ( Figure 2A , A4 inset , arrowhead , see below for more details ) further suggesting that the MU arborization was not globally degenerating at this stage . Strikingly , most MUs in SOD1 mutant mice ( 16/19 arbors , 10/11 animals ) behaved in a similar fashion , that is , losing NMJs over several imaging sessions rather than abruptly . These include partial ( 29/253 imaged NMJs , 12/19 arbors ) and complete NMJ losses ( 38/253 imaged NMJs , 10/19 arbors ) . Thus , NMJ loss within a single MU starts as a slow asynchronous process , occurring independently of axonal degeneration . A number of visualized motor axons and their remaining NMJs were eventually lost in a synchronous manner ( 7/19 MU arbors , 5/11 mice; Figure 3A ) showing that global MU degeneration ultimately occurs . This phenomenon likely reflects an axonal or central event , such as MN death . Importantly , signs of NMJ denervation preceded most of these MU degenerations ( Figure 3B , 6/7 MU arbors ) . In several cases ( 11/19 MU arbors ) , asynchronous NMJ dismantling started more than a month ( ≥ 3 sessions ) prior to global degeneration of the MU , again showing that NMJ loss is initially a slow asynchronous process ( Figure 3B ) . Hence , we identified two phases of NMJ loss within a MU: an initial slow local branch-specific dismantlement , followed by a sudden global axonal degeneration . These different patterns of MU degeneration are unlikely to be due to differences in MU types ( Frey et al . , 2000; Hegedus et al . , 2007; Hegedus et al . , 2008; Pun et al . , 2006 ) . Indeed , fiber type ( indicative of MU type ) composition was examined on Tibialis anterior cross sections and revealed that nearly all superficial fibers in SOD1G37R/YFP were fast-fatigable during the period of imaging ( myosin heavy-chain isoforms type IIb or IIx; Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Surprisingly , a vast majority of MUs in SOD1G37R/YFP also sprouted toward nearby nAChR-rich postsynaptic sites , forming new synaptic contacts on muscle fibers that they did not innervate initially ( MU expansions or ‘heterologous re-innervation’ , Figure 4A , B; 76/253 NMJs , 14/19 arbors , 9/11 animals ) . These numerous expansions resulted in a net increase in MU size which masked the contemporaneous NMJ dismantlement ( Figure 4C; 26 . 0 ± 10 . 2% loss vs 80 . 7 ± 32 . 2% expansions on session 6 ) . Importantly , we found that over half of analyzed MUs both lost and formed new NMJs throughout the imaging process ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 , 13/19 arbors , 8/11 animals ) , showing that these opposite processes can occur simultaneously within a single MU . Interestingly , however , there was an inverse relationship between the propensity of axonal branches to be lost or to expand ( Figure 4D ) . Indeed , NMJs arising from distal axonal branches were more susceptible to being lost ( Figure 4D , red dots , 38 events , n = 253 , N = 11 , logistic regression , p=0 . 010 ) , while MU expansions were more likely to occur on proximal branches ( mainly first-order branches ) ( Figure 4D , blue dots , 76 events , n = 253 , N = 11 , logistic regression , p=0 . 001 ) . Hence , proximal branches preserve their capacity to re-innervate heterologous NMJs despite the ongoing degeneration of distal branches at the single MU level . Regardless of this extensive compensation , few MUs re-innervated their own lost NMJs ( ‘autologous re-innervation’ ) and most partial losses were not repaired ( Figure 4C , purple; 2/21 and 15/40 possibilities , respectively ) . Immunolabeling of all motor axons after the last in vivo session showed that some of these asynchronously lost NMJs had been reinnervated by other MUs ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 , N = 4 ) , confirming that these vacated postsynaptic sites were not refractory to reinnervation in general . This process led the initial NMJ pool of surviving MUs to gradually recede ( Figure 4C , green ) even though their total size remained stable or increased in most cases due to heterologous expansions ( Figure 4C , blue ) . Altogether , these results show that rather than being exclusively degenerating or compensating , MUs are highly dynamic during disease progression , with specific branches either expanding or disassembling . To gain further insight into the mechanisms underlying NMJ dismantlement , we next examined the spatial and temporal relationship between denervation events taking place within a MU . Indeed , local signals emanating from muscle fibers , glial cells or a damaged axonal branch ( e . g . chemorepulsive molecules ( De Winter et al . , 2006; Maimon et al . , 2018 ) or misfolded proteins ( Ayers et al . , 2016; Grad et al . , 2014 ) could potentially propagate through the extracellular space and contribute to NMJ loss in ALS . If such local signals in the neuromuscular environment influence NMJ dismantlement , one would predict that these events may tend to propagate from one or several focal points . To test this possibility , we performed a Sholl-like analysis on all MU arbors bearing multiple complete NMJ losses ( 37 events out of 141 NMJs over 9 MU arbors , N = 6; see Materials and methods ) . Interestingly , asynchronous NMJ dismantling tended to propagate from the first lost NMJ ( Figure 5A and B; multivariate repeated-measures GLM with logistic distribution , interaction between distance and time: p<0 . 001 ) . Indeed , adjacent events ( <300 μm away ) occurred preferentially , but not exclusively , within the next two sessions ( T2 ) , while remote events ( >300 μm ) occurred exclusively three or more sessions later ( T3+ ) . These results unravel a propagation pattern and suggest that factors extrinsic to motor axons ( i . e . the local neuromuscular environment ) interact with the intrinsic properties of motor axons ( e . g . susceptibility of specific branches ) , to shape the pattern of NMJ loss in ALS . 
 Overall , this detailed in vivo analysis reveals a previously unsuspected dynamism at the NMJ in an animal model of ALS . Our findings highlight a long temporal window between early branch-specific dismantling and global motor axon degeneration which could be therapeutically exploited in ALS ( Arbour et al . , 2017; Moloney et al . , 2014 ) . 
 WT/YFP ( SOD1-/-;YFP+/- ) and SOD1G37R/YFP ( SOD1+/-;YFP+/- ) double transgenic mice were obtained by crossing transgenic males heterozygote for the human SOD1G37R transgene ( flanked by LoxP sites; loxSOD1G37R ) to transgenic females heterozygote for the Thy1-YFP transgene ( line H; [B6 . Cg-Tg ( Thy1-YFP ) HJrs/J]; The Jackson laboratories , Bar Harbor , ME , stock number 003782 ) ( Feng et al . , 2000 ) . LoxSOD1G37R mice have been described previously ( Boillée et al . , 2006b; Lobsiger et al . , 2009 ) . Single transgenic lines were maintained on a C57BL/6J background . Progenies were genotyped for the SOD1 and the YFP transgenes by PCR performed on a tail sample or an ear punch extract . Mice of both sexes were used . Disease progression was monitored through weekly weighing and all-limb grip strength measurements ( BioSeb , FL; BIO-GS3 ) . Animals were sacrificed using a lethal dose of isoflurane . All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care , the Comité de Déontologie sur l’Expérimentation Animale of Université de Montréal ( protocol #18 – 040 ) and the CRCHUM Institutional Committee for the Protection of Animals ( protocol #N16008CVV and #N15047ADPs ) . Procedures for repeated in vivo imaging of the Tibialis anterior muscle were adapted from previous reports ( Li et al . , 2011; Schaefer et al . , 2005; Turney et al . , 2012 ) . Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane ( 2 – 3% in 98 – 97% O2 ) in an induction chamber and maintained under anesthesia using a breathing mask . Mice were placed on their side and a hind limb was immobilized on a custom-made stand . Eye drying was prevented by applying a lubricant ( Vaseline ) . The Tibialis anterior muscle was exposed through an incision made on the external side of the leg ( from ~5 – 10 mm proximal to the knee to ~5 mm proximal the ankle ) . The skin was drawn tight using four hooks ( Guthrie Retractors; #17021 – 13; FST , Canada ) mounted on custom-made blocks around the leg . The muscle was immersed in a physiological solution by regular irrigation with sterile lactated Ringer ( B . Braun Medical , CDMV , Canada ) . Postsynaptic nAChRs were labeled with a non-blocking concentration of Alexa594-conjuguated α-Bungarotoxin ( BTX , 5 μg/mL in sterile lactated Ringer for 10 min; Molecular Probes , Fischer Scientific , Canada ) . α-BTX was applied on the first session and was reapplied once ( if necessary ) only when the labeling was too dim , usually on session 5 or 6 . Muscle contractions and synaptic transmission are known to be preserved at this concentration of α-BTX ( Arbour et al . , 2015; Li et al . , 2011; Turney et al . , 2012; Zuo et al . , 2004 and unpublished observations ) . NMJs near the surface were imaged using a 20X water immersion objective ( 0 . 4 NA , Nikon , Japan ) mounted on an upright epifluorescent microscope ( Nikon , Optiphot-2 ) equipped with a Neo-sCMOS camera ( Andor , UK ) . Fluorescence excitation and emission were filtered using a Brightline Pinkel filter set optimized for CFP/YFP/HcRed ( CFP/YFP/HcRed-3X-A-000; Semrock , NY ) . Images of the whole superficial MU axonal arborization at multiple focal planes were acquired using the Metafluor software ( Molecular Devices , CA ) . After the imaging session , the wound was sutured using 5 – 0 or 6 – 0 vicryl suture ( Johnson and Johnson ) , followed by tissue glue ( GLUture; Abbot Laboratories , WPI , FL ) . Buprenorphine ( 3 μg/10 g body weight; Temgesic , CEVA Animal Health Ltd , UK ) was administered by subcutaneous injections three times a day for 24 hr following the surgery . Antibiotics ( 0 . 1 mg/10 g body weight; Baytril; Bayer . Inc , Canada ) were administered subcutaneously every 24 hr for 72 hr . Mice were given a small treat after each surgery ( Nutella ) to reduce stress and improve recovery . Except for two cases , imaging sessions were performed 2 weeks apart . All available SOD1 animals with YFP-positive surface motor axons , were included in the in vivo analysis ( 16/44 mice tested ) . Only mice in which the MU arbor could be reliably followed for at least three sessions , with at least three NMJs near the surface , were included in the analysis ( 11/16 mice ) . NMJs which were too deep to be fully resolved were discarded . Images were analyzed using the Fiji software . First , focal planes from the same region were aligned using the ‘StackReg’ pluggin . MU branches were traced using the ‘Simple Neurite Tracer’ plugin . The clearest session ( generally session 1 ) was chosen for tracing . All segments of the MU arbor ( from each region imaged ) were merged in Photoshop ( Adobe ) and BTX labelling ( in the overlap between the regions ) was used as a reference for alignment . Tracings were used as a map to identify each NMJ on subsequent imaging sessions . For the purpose of this analysis , two labeled branches that could not be undoubtedly linked to the same main motor axon were considered as independent MNs . Then , the state of innervation of each NMJ was determined and a MU dynamic diagram showing the state of each NMJ within the arborization on each session was created using Visio2013 ( Microsoft ) . NMJs were then classified based on their dynamic changes ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . For figure representations , contrast was linearly adjusted to facilitate observations . For the spatio-temporal analysis ( Sholl-like analysis ) of asynchronous NMJ dismantling ( Figure 5 ) , distance between NMJs and the initial loss was measured on the full MU tracings or , for a few cases , directly on the raw aligned images . The initial event ( center ) was defined as the first completely lost NMJ . When two or more NMJs were lost simultaneously , the one which first showed signs of denervation ( partial loss ) was defined as the center . If they could not be distinguished in this manner , the analysis was carried out with multiple centers ( 2/9 MU arbors ) . For one animal ( #34 ) , several branches were fairly close to each other , that is in the same field of view ( branches A and B , C and D ) . To more accurately assess the presence of a spreading pattern , a single center per field of view was determined . Branch order was determined using the motor-unit dynamic diagrams . MU expansions were assigned the same branch order as the branch from which they originated from , to determine likelihood of sprouting of axonal branches . To create the heat map ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) , the % of change was calculated by counting the number of gained or lost NMJs over the number of initial NMJs . Partial gains/losses counted as half an event . When an NMJ could not be observed , the % of change was spread across the sessions where it could have occurred . Procedures for tissue preparation and immunostaining were done as previously described ( Tremblay et al . , 2017 ) Briefly , the Tibialis anterior was dissected in an oxygenated ( 95% O2 , 5% CO2 ) Ringer REES solution and mounted in 10% Tragacanth ( Sigma-Aldrich , Canada ) . Muscles were frozen in isopentane cooled to −80°C in liquid nitrogen . Transverse cryosections ( 10 μm ) were incubated in blocking solution ( 10% normal donkey serum in PBS; Jackson Immunoresearch , PA ) for 30 min , then with primary antibodies for 1 hr , and then with secondary antibodies for 1 hr . Sections were finally mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent ( Molecular Probes , Fischer Scientific ) . Sections were rinsed three times with PBS 1X for 5 min between each step . Primary antibodies , all from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ( DSHB , IA ) , were either mouse IgG1 α -MHC type IIa ( SC-71c , 1:200 ) , mouse IgG2b α-MHC type I ( BA-D5c , 1:100 ) and mouse IgM α -MHC type IIb ( BF-F3c , 1:200 ) or mouse IgM α -MHC type IIx ( 6H1s; 1:10 ) and mouse IgG1 α -MHC all but IIx ( BF-35c , 1:200 ) . Secondary antibodies were goat α-mouse IgG1 Alexa 594 ( #115-585-205 ) , goat α-mouse IgG2b Alexa 488 ( #115-545-207 ) and goat α-mouse IgM Alexa 647 ( #115-605-020 ) , all from Jackson Immunoresearch ( all 1:500 ) . Observations were made using an Olympus FV1000 or a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscope with a 20X water immersion objective ( N . A 0 . 95 or 1 . 0 , respectively ) . Whole muscle sections were reconstructed by superimposing maximum intensity projections of each stack in Photoshop ( Adobe ) . Procedures for whole-mount muscle preparation , spinal cord sectioning and immunostaining were performed as previously described ( Tremblay et al . , 2017 ) , with some minor adjustments . Mice were transcardially perfused with cold PBS 1X and 4% formaldehyde . Both Tibialis anteriors were then dissected and post-fixed for 20 min in 4% formaldehyde while the whole mouse was further fixed overnight at 4°C . Lumbar spinal cords were dissected , post-fixed for 2 hr , cryoprotected in a 30% sucrose-PBS solution for 72 hr at 4°C and frozen in cooled isopentane ( −40 to −50°C ) . Floating 30-μm-thick spinal cord cryosections were washed twice in PBS 1X , incubated in a donkey blocking solution ( 10% NDS , 0 . 3% Triton X-100 in PBS 1X ) for 1 hr and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies against Choline Acetyl-Transferase ( ChAT; 1:100; Goat; Millipore , Canada; AB144P ) and Neuronal Nuclei ( NeuN; 1:300; Mouse IgG1; Millipore; MAB377 ) in donkey blocking solution , then incubated with the secondary antibody donkey anti-goat Alexa 594 ( 1:500; #705-585-147; Jackson Immunoresearch ) in donkey blocking solution for 1 hr , then incubated in a goat blocking solution ( 10% Normal Goat Serum , 0 . 3% Triton X-100 in PBS 1X ) for 1 hr , then incubated with the goat anti-mouse IgG1 DyLight 405 secondary antibody ( 1:500; #115-475-205; Jackson Immunoresearch ) in goat blocking solution for 1 hr and then finally mounted with Prolong Diamond antifade reagent ( Molecular Probes ) . Sections were washed thrice with PBS 1X ( 5 min each ) after each antibody incubation . Tibialis anterior muscles were permeabilized in 100% cold methanol at −20°C for 6 min , then incubated for 1 hr in blocking solution ( 10% NDS , 1% of Triton-X100 diluted in PBS 1X ) . Muscles were then incubated with a rabbit anti-S100β antibody ( 1:250 , Z0311 , Dako ) in blocking solution for 23 hr at 4°C , then with chicken anti-neurofilament M , ( NF-M , 1:2000 , Rockland Immunochemicals Inc ) and mouse IgG1 anti-synaptic vesicular protein 2 ( SV2 , 1:2000 , Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank ) for 23 hr at 4°C , then with the secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa 647 ( #115-605-205 ) , donkey anti-chicken Alexa 647 ( #703-605-155 ) and donkey anti-rabbit DyLight 405 ( #711-475-152 ) ( all 1:500; Jackson Immunoresearch ) simultaneously with Alexa594-conjugated-α-BTX ( 1 . 33 µg/ml , Molecular Probes , Fischer Scientific , Canada ) for 2 hr . Finally , whole muscle preparations were mounted in Prolong Diamond antifade reagent ( Molecular Probes ) . Muscles were washed six times ( 10 min each ) in PBS 1X-Triton 0 . 01% . Observations and image acquisition were performed on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope with a 20X water immersion objective ( N . A . 1 . 0 ) or a 63X oil immersion objective ( N . A . 1 . 4 ) . No image manipulations were performed after acquisition , except for linear contrast adjustments for figure presentation . For motor neuron counts , MNs in both ventral horns were counted from 15 to 20 sections per animal , at least 90 μm apart . ChAT- and NeuN-positive cells in the ventral horn were counted as α-MNs while ChAT-positive and NeuN-negative cells were counted as γ-MNs as previously described ( Lalancette-Hebert et al . , 2016; Tremblay et al . , 2017 ) . The Allan Brain Atlas Mouse Spinal cord reference set was used as a reference to ensure that all analyzed sections were in the lumbar spinal cord . Results are expressed as the average number of cells counted per ventral horn in each animal . For the Sholl-like analysis , each lost NMJ represented an event in time ( time after initial loss ) and space ( distance from the initial loss ) occurring over a given number of trials ( total number of NMJs ) . This type of data ( i . e . number of observations over a number of trials as a % of events ) follows a logistic distribution rather than a Gaussian distribution . Hence , a multivariate repeated-measures Generalized linear models ( GLM ) using a logistic distribution was created to test the effects of time and space on the likelihood of observing an event . The time after the initial loss was set as a ‘within-NMJ’ factor ( the repeated measure ) while distance from the initial loss was set as a continuous ‘between-NMJs’ variable . The raw measured distance was used rather than the range bins presented in Figure 5 . For the branch order analysis , a similar approach was used . Each lost or gained NMJ represented an event occurring over a given number of trials ( number of NMJs within that branch order ) in eight conditions ( branch orders ) . Hence , a logistic regression was used to test the effect of the branch order on the likelihood of an NMJ being loss ( using the univariate GLM with logistic distribution command ) . The branch order was set as an ordinal variable ( continuous ) . For these analyses , ‘n’ ( the number of trials , i . e . the sample size ) represent the number of NMJs observed while ‘N’ ( the biological replicates ) represents the number of animals . p-Values smaller than 0 . 05 ( α = 5% ) were considered statistically significant . Analyses were performed in the SPSS 24 . 0 . 0 . 0 ( IBM ) software . When two independent groups were compared , unpaired two-tailed t-tests were performed using Welch’s correction for unequal variance or a Mann-Withney test when data did not follow the assumption of a Gaussian distribution . Variances were compared using the F-test . When the effect of one variable was compared over time ( motor behavior , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , two-way ANOVAs with repeated measures ( RM ) were used . For the post-test , Holm-Sidak’s correction was used . For NMJ innervation ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , the effect of genotype was analyzed using a GLM with a logistic distribution and Holm-Sidak’s correction was applied for the post-test as previously described ( Tremblay et al . , 2017 ) . Importantly , a GLM with a logistic distribution was used for NMJ innervation instead of a t-test ( as for motor neuron counts ) because NMJ innervation data ( # of denervated NMJs/ # of total NMJs for each animal ) does not follow a Gaussian distribution . Unless otherwise stated , data are presented as mean ± SEM in the histograms and in the text . For these analyses , ‘N’ represents the number of biological replicates ( animals , i . e . the sample size ) while “n’ represents the number of observations ( number of NMJs unless otherwise stated ) . p-Values smaller than 0 . 05 ( α = 5% ) were considered statistically significant . These analyses were performed in the GraphPad Prism 7 . 0 software , with the exception of the analysis for the NMJ innervation was made in SPSS 24 . 0 . 0 . 0 . No sample size estimations were performed before the experiments . All available SOD1 animals which met our inclusion/exclusion criteria were included ( see in vivo images and data analysis ) . For the NMJ innervation and motor neuron counts experiments , sample sizes similar to previous experiments were used ( Tremblay et al . , 2017 ) . No test to detect outliers was performed .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']",['neuroscience'],elife-41973-v2,224,5519,5295,24.638392857142858

However , their structures are not rigid: proteins bend and rotate in response to their environment . Identifying these movements is an important part of understanding how proteins work and interact with each other . Unfortunately , when researchers study the structures of proteins , they often look at the ‘average’ shape a protein takes , missing out on other conformations the protein might only be in temporarily . An important technique for studying protein flexibility is known as single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) . In this technique , two light-sensitive tags are attached to the same protein molecule and give off a signal when they come into close contact . This nano-scale sensor allows structural biologists to get information from individual protein movements that can be lost when looking at the average conformations of proteins . Advances in the instruments used to perform FRET have made observing the motion of individual proteins more widely accessible to non-specialists , but the analysis of the data that these instruments produce still requires a high level of expertise . To lower the barrier for non-specialists to use the technology , and to ensure that experiments can be reproduced on different instruments and by different researchers , Thomsen et al . have developed a new way to automate the data analysis . They used machine learning technology to recognize , filter and characterize data so as to produce reliable results , with the user only needing to perform a couple of steps . This new analysis approach could help expand the use of single-molecule FRET to different fields , allowing researchers to investigate the importance of protein flexibility for certain diseases , or to better understand the roles that proteins have in a cell .","Single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer ( smFRET ) is an adaptable method for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules . The development of high throughput methodologies and the growth of commercial instrumentation have outpaced the development of rapid , standardized , and automated methodologies to objectively analyze the wealth of produced data . Here we present DeepFRET , an automated , open-source standalone solution based on deep learning , where the only crucial human intervention in transiting from raw microscope images to histograms of biomolecule behavior , is a user-adjustable quality threshold . Integrating standard features of smFRET analysis , DeepFRET consequently outputs the common kinetic information metrics . Its classification accuracy on ground truth data reached >95% outperforming human operators and commonly used threshold , only requiring ~1% of the time . Its precise and rapid operation on real data demonstrates DeepFRET’s capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular dynamics and the potential to contribute to benchmarking smFRET for dynamic structural biology . 
 Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer ( smFRET ) combined with TIRFm ( total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ) is a key powerful method to study the structure of biomolecules and provide a dynamic perspective in structural biology ( Lerner et al . , 2018 ) . Capturing the real-time readouts of nanometer-scale distances of individual biomolecules by smFRET allows the direct observations of dynamics , interactions , and intermediates of stochastic non-accumulating events , as well as dynamic equilibria between unsynchronized molecules , all of which are obscured in ensemble averaging techniques ( Dimura et al . , 2016; Hellenkamp et al . , 2018; Holmstrom et al . , 2019; Juette et al . , 2016; Newton et al . , 2019; Preus et al . , 2015; Roy et al . , 2008; Schuler and Eaton , 2008; Stella et al . , 2018 ) . The high fidelity and proficiency of smFRET established it as a key toolbox for the accurate characterization of mechanisms , biomolecular interactions function , and even structures of biomolecules ( Craggs and Kapanidis , 2012; Dulin et al . , 2018; Kalinin et al . , 2012; Kilic et al . , 2018; Ratzke et al . , 2014 ) , under both in vitro ( Schluesche et al . , 2007; Sharma et al . , 2008; Stein et al . , 2011 ) and in vivo ( Okamoto et al . , 2020; Sakon and Weninger , 2010 ) conditions . Despite its great quantitative utility and profound impact on structural biology , smFRET is not a direct imaging modality and data treatment for extracting quantitative dynamic information relies on multiple layers of preprocessing: raw image treatment , trace selection , and data analysis . Raw image treatment ( Greenfeld et al . , 2012; Hon and Gonzalez , 2019; Juette et al . , 2016; Preus et al . , 2015; Stella et al . , 2018 ) and data analysis of the selected smFRET traces is in general well-standardized and relies on well-defined methodologies with strong theoretical backing ( Hon and Gonzalez , 2019; Schmid et al . , 2016 ) . The actual trace selection can be time-consuming but crucial due to the presence of undesired phenomena at the single-molecule scale , such as sample aggregation , fluorescent contaminants , incomplete or incorrect sample labeling , complex photophysical behaviors , and high noise , to mention a few ( Algar et al . , 2019; Hellenkamp et al . , 2018; Roy et al . , 2008 ) . Existing software ( Greenfeld et al . , 2012; Hellenkamp et al . , 2018; Hon and Gonzalez , 2019; Juette et al . , 2016; Preus et al . , 2015; Stella et al . , 2018 ) by single-molecule labs can simplify the tedious and time-consuming selection of traces and were recently expanded to large datasets ( Juette et al . , 2016 ) albeit requiring some form of manual supervision and hyper-parameter tuning selecting the proper thresholds by an expert user . This need for human intervention could potentially be subjected to cognitive biases especially by less experienced users and could limit the expansion of smFRET to classic biology labs . The increasing expansion of smFRET to structural biology labs would benefit from rapid and benchmarked methodologies , reproducible across laboratories , with minimal human intervention . This is highlighted by several initiatives to standardize the smFRET field ( Greenfeld et al . , 2012; Hellenkamp et al . , 2018; Lerner et al . , 2018; Sali et al . , 2015 ) . Recent advances in machine learning ( ML ) and specifically deep learning ( DL ) ( LeCun et al . , 2015 ) , have radically improved our capacity to access and extract information from abstract and noisy inputs independently of human interventions as we ( ATLAS collaboration , 2014 ) and others have shown ( Berg et al . , 2019; Christiansen et al . , 2018; Falk et al . , 2019; Gómez-García et al . , 2018; Jones , 2019; Ouyang et al . , 2018; Smith et al . , 2019; Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . DL implementations are providing high-level robust performances and have been successfully used to analyze and augment a wide range of the fluorescence microscopy analysis pipeline including assessing microscope image quality ( Yang et al . , 2018 ) , in-silico cell labeling ( Christiansen et al . , 2018 ) , single-cell morphology analysis ( Berg et al . , 2019; Falk et al . , 2019 ) , detecting single molecules ( White et al . , 2020; Wu and Rifkin , 2015 ) and linking smFRET experiments with molecular dynamics simulations ( Matsunaga and Sugita , 2018 ) , amongst others ( Berg et al . , 2019; Christiansen et al . , 2018; Falk et al . , 2019; Gómez-García et al . , 2018; Jones , 2019; Ouyang et al . , 2018; Smith et al . , 2019; Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . Deep learning-based analysis has several advantages over other approaches: It recognizes abstract patterns and learns useful features directly from the raw input data , which allows the implementation of analysis routines that do not require extensive data preprocessing or empirically defined rules , and thus offer reproducible and less opinionated evaluation of single-molecule data; It is significantly faster than human annotation for large single-molecule datasets; it comes close to , or outperforms human performance; and its performance is increased when increasing dataset size constituting an ideal case for evaluating the large datasets obtained from single-molecule data ( Berg et al . , 2019; Christiansen et al . , 2018; Falk et al . , 2019; Gómez-García et al . , 2018; Jones , 2019; Ouyang et al . , 2018; Smith et al . , 2019; Zhang et al . , 2018 ) . Especially important are convolutional deep neural networks ( DNN ) , artificial neural networks that learn to approximate the underlying function that transforms input to associated output through multiple rounds of optimization . The strength of DNN is the ability to learn arbitrarily complex functions to best recognize particular aspects of the given input data and model complex nonlinear relationships . The DNN is then able to classify data into predefined classes based on the provided training labels . While the training of a DNN is generally a computationally intensive process , once trained the final model can easily be shared and used for making predictions at almost no computational cost to end-users . Here we provide DeepFRET , an all-inclusive analysis software with a pre-trained DNN at its core , for a rapid , objective , and accurate assessment of smFRET data for quantifying biomolecular dynamics . The fully automated analysis software operates with minimal crucial human intervention and requires only a threshold on the data quality confidence , as an initial step , to output detailed quantification of structural dynamic from raw images . This is attained by an intuitive and user-friendly interface that integrates and automates common smFRET analysis procedures ( Greenfeld et al . , 2012; Hellenkamp et al . , 2018; Hon and Gonzalez , 2019; Juette et al . , 2016; Preus et al . , 2015; Stella et al . , 2018 ) from raw image analysis and background-corrected intensity trace extraction ( Thomsen et al . , 2019 ) , to sophisticated trace classification , statistical analysis of single-molecule data and production of publication-quality figures of dynamic structural biology insights ( see Materials and methods ) . DeepFRET comes as a free-to-use standalone executable for both Windows and Mac users allowing end-users with limited programming skills to easily operate it . A script-based version implemented entirely in Python enables experts to adjust features pipelining the analysis specified for their needs . We anticipate DeepFRET to take full advantage of the widespread digitization and open repository of smFRET data and form a reference point setting a bar for the data quality and data classification performance metrics , offering additional benchmarking the field for dynamic structural biology . 
 DeepFRET is an open-source software package that implements a neural network model architecture for data evaluation integrating into a user-friendly platform all common procedures for smFRET analysis ( Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplements 1–2 ) . The neural network model architecture used here is based on a deep convolutional neural network to recognize particular spatial features present in the data . The model first passes the data through several layers of convolutions of different lengths , and in the process learns to recognize which particular elements of a sample are present at different length scales , to best classify it correctly . This has previously been used to label time-series data such as electrocardiographs ( Hannun et al . , 2019 ) or electrical readouts in DNA sequencing ( Wick et al . , 2018 ) . Additionally , we added a long short-term memory ( LSTM ) layer after the convolutional layers , as this will also help the model to learn temporality in the data and propagate to the later frames the learned information ( Karim et al . , 2018; Oh et al . , 2018 ) . A detailed description of the model hyperparameters and architecture can be found in the Materials and methods section . To ensure that the predictions of DeepFRET would generalize to a wide range of experimentally observable behaviors independently of biological systems or experimental conditions , we provide a fully pre-trained DNN model . The implemented DNN is pre-trained on 150 , 000 simulated traces that uniformly sample all possible FRET states , their respective lifetimes , occupancies , and transition pathways , as well as all possible noise levels , ensuring that the data represents all theoretically possible configurations ( see Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplements 3–5 , Materials and methods for software and algorithms ) . As such DeepFRET does not require the selection of any direct initial guesses of FRET values or user-defined parameter pretraining . However , we do provide both a script-based method for simulating smFRET data and a simple graphical interface for expert end-users to adjust simulation distribution parameters ( see Figure 1b , Figure 1—figure supplement 6 and Materials and methods ) for model re-training if needed ( e . g . for specific circumstances or stricter criteria ) . This offers experts the possibility to benchmark the impact of , for example , one’s sorting criteria , noise , and optical correction factors . We built DeepFRET to treat both alternating laser excitation ( ALEX ) and non-ALEX FRET data . DeepFRET imports raw microscope images and performs colocalization of the two channels , to extract background corrected intensity traces of DD ( donor excitation; donor emission ) , DA ( donor excitation; acceptor emission ) , their respective stoichiometry , and in the case of ALEX data , also AA ( acceptor excitation; acceptor emission; see Figure 1a , Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . Alternatively , one can directly load and process previously-obtained time-traces ASCII format as exported from the popular software package iSMS ( Preus et al . , 2015 ) without their associated videos . For a given time trace the DNN predicts and outputs six softmaxed probabilities pi to each time frame ( Figure 1c , Figure 1—figure supplement 5 and Materials and methods ) , representing the six categories it has been trained to recognize: bleached ( B ) , static smFRET within the experimental time frame ( S ) , dynamic smFRET ( D ) , aggregate ( A ) , noisy ( N ) , and all other types of non treatable data smFRET data defined here as scrambled ( X ) ( Figure 1c , Figure 1—figure supplements 5 and 7 ) . Both static and dynamic traces are included for further analysis . Given these probabilities , which sums to one , a simple sliding window then searches for frames predicted by the DNN to be bleached ( pB >0 . 5 , see ( Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplements 5–8 ) for evaluation accuracy , and blinking exclusion ) . When bleaching is found , the rest of the trace is removed to exclude the photobleached frames part of a trace from further analysis . If the trace still contains a minimum number of viable frames ( here set to 15 but adjustable ) , the probabilities are summed up over all remaining time frames for each of the five remaining categories and divided by the number of frames for normalization ( see Materials and methods and Figure 1c , Figure 1—figure supplements 5–8 ) . We define the summaries of the combined static and dynamic trace scores as the ‘DeepFRET score’ , representing the DNN model confidence that a trace is truly smFRET . The user-friendly interface displays all the categories and their associated probabilities , and offers the option for expert users to manually revise the classified traces . If the DeepFRET score is above the user-defined threshold , the trace is accepted for the subsequent analysis ( see Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplement 8 and Materials and methods ) . Subsequent analysis involves two-channel fitting of idealized FRET traces using Hidden Markov modeling HMM ( using the open-source package pomegranate ) ; data and statistical evaluation of the abundance of FRET states and lifetimes; application of correction factors; and transition density plots ( see Figure 1b , Figure 1—figure supplements 6 and 9–11 ) . The number of underlying FRET distributions is automatically determined using Bayesian information criterion ( BIC ) , offering the unbiased analysis of distribution of biomolecular distances ( see Figure 1b , Figure 1—figure supplements 6 and 9–11 ) . All data can be directly exported in publication-quality figures or extracted as data for user specific analysis if required . To test our DeepFRET performance in practice , we initially compared it with commonly used threshold values . To be on the safe site , we simulated 200 ground truth smFRET traces and merged them with a dataset containing 5000 random , non-smFRET traces ( too noisy , aggregates of multiple molecules , aberrant single-molecule behavior , see Materials and methods for parameter descriptions ) . The obtained overall FRET distribution would be akin to what one would observe experimentally before any preprocessing of smFRET data on a low purity protein sample ( Figure 2a ) . Common procedures for pre-selecting valid data for treatment often rely on an initial automatic threshold for discarding this large fraction of non-smFRET data ( see Figure 1a ) . This is based on any number of combinations of the anticorrelated signal of the donor and acceptor , fluorophore bleaching , noise levels , or certain ranges of fluorophore stoichiometry , if recorded using ALEX methods ( Hellenkamp et al . , 2018; Hohlbein et al . , 2014; Juette et al . , 2016; Lee et al . , 2005; McKinney et al . , 2006; Preus et al . , 2015; van de Meent et al . , 2014 ) . We first removed photobleaching and then accepted or rejected traces based on commonly used thresholds of median stoichiometry and max intensity ( but not anticorrelation , see Materials and methods ) without any manual post-inspection of the data . Figure 2b displays ground truth distribution ( green ) and the distribution of the accepted traces ( pink ) for varying the above thresholds . We recovered a poorly-defined FRET distribution that even at the tightest threshold does not recapitulate the underlying ground truth two-state conformational equilibrium . We calculated the common model evaluation metrics ‘precision’ and ‘recall’ ( see Materials and methods ) to quantify the quality of the predictions . The precision and recall , though improved by tightening the threshold , remain around 0 . 22 and 0 . 40 , in the best case for simple thresholding ( Figure 2b ) . The fact that out of 366 selected traces only 80 were true positive , while 286 were false positive and 120 false negative , highlights the need for human intervention as many traces are indistinguishable with simple statistical characterization ( selected examples are shown below the histograms [Figure 2b] ) . DeepFRET , on the other hand , allowed the high-fidelity recovery of the underlying ground truth distribution reaching a precision of 0 . 91 when setting a DeepFRET score of 0 . 85 ( Figure 2c ) without the need for human intervention . The virtually identical FRET distributions , matching the ground truth data , that are derived for a large fraction of score thresholds ( 0 . 5– 0 . 85 ) show no systematic biases originating from data evaluation and illustrate the minimum impact of human interventions when using DeepFRET ( see Figure 2 , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . As expected , the fidelity of DeepFRET pertained to correctly identifying single or complex multistate FRET distributions ( see Figure 2 , Figure 2—figure supplements 1–2 ) reaching precision 0 . 91 as compared to just 0 . 22 for standard threshold setting in the absence of further human intervention . The practically identical precision and recall for single , double or triple , state FRET distributions independently of threshold further support the wide applicability to multiple biological systems . Quantification of precision and recall of the selection for various DeepFRET score thresholds displays the tradeoffs in recovering a high fraction of useful data . Thresholding data with scores in the regime 0 . 8–0 . 9 appears optimal for maintaining sufficient and high-fidelity data ( Figure 2 , Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) for the trace characteristics here . Based on these data , we employed a DeepFRET score threshold of 0 . 85 as optimal for maintaining high precision at reasonable recall values . We note that depending on datasets , imaging condition , noise levels , etc . , users may need to adjust the threshold . The power of DeepFRET is further highlighted by the classification for the traces that were assigned as false negative and false positive by commonly accepted thresholds ( traces in Figure 2b and Figure 2c , Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . In summary , the fidelity of classification accuracy appears to supersede currently used simple thresholding , without human interventions . This was achieved in a fraction of the time required for data classification by human operators ( ~1 min for 10 , 000 traces on a normal laptop , as compared to potentially days for manually inspected traces ) . This improved classification was also achieved entirely without any preprocessing or post-inspection of data , illustrating the power of DeepFRET to operate without human interventions and its potential to benchmark the reproducibility of smFRET data acquisition methods for multiple biomolecular systems across laboratories . We quantified and displayed using confusion matrix the discordance between the ground truth data and the data selected and classified by DeepFRET ( Figure 3 ) . In the confusion matrices , displayed in Figure 3 , each row represents the predicted classification of traces while each column represents the ground truth data . The high classification accuracy for the annotation of individual frames is highlighted by the clear diagonal feature . We found similar classification performance for a DNN trained on non-ALEX FRET ( by a DNN with only DD and DA inputs , which we will refer to as ‘ALEX-disabled’; Figure 3 right panels ) signifying the applicability of the DeepFRET approach to both ALEX and non-ALEX FRET data . The misclassification between static and dynamic smFRET traces is practically non-existent and consists of <3% dynamic traces being misclassified as static , for both model types . This is important for accurately quantifying the abundance of static and dynamic subpopulations within the experimental time frame , which has been shown to have a clear experimental impact ( He et al . , 2019; Kilic et al . , 2018; Osuka et al . , 2018; Wood et al . , 2012 ) . DeepFRET was found to classify bleached or aggregated frames with a 98% the true positives for ALEX-FRET model enabled ( 97% for the non-ALEX model ) , whereas only 89% ( and 83% for ALEX-disabled ) of the scrambled traces were correctly classified ( see also Figure 2—figure supplement 3 for a detailed breakdown of the precision and recall ) . We note that the model is trained with a noise contribution that is drawn from a normal distribution of varying width ( σ uniformly distributed between 0 . 01 and 0 . 30 , multiplied by the maximum single fluorophore intensity ) with a small contribution of gamma-distributed noise . As such , traces with σ above 0 . 25 are characterized by the employed DNN as ‘noisy’ ( see Figure 2 , Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Materials and methods ) . In a regime where transition rates are similar to the imaging temporal resolution , traces may be incorrectly classified as noisy by the model . To allow experts to accept more noisy traces or traces with fast transition rates that may appear as noisy for given imaging conditions , we integrated into the DeepFRET a visual trace simulator . This user-friendly simulator allows the generation of traces with ground truth labels of traces where all parameters are tunable to integrate the specific needs of each lab ( see Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplements 6 and 11 ) . We found the classification accuracy of each frame to be consistent with the classification accuracy on each trace , later derived from the overall most probable class given all predictions of individual frames of a trace ( Figure 3a , Figure 3b , Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplement 6 and Materials and methods ) . This is achieved by adding a bidirectional long short-term memory , LSTM , layer at the end of the DNN ( Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The LSTM layer allows coherent predictions throughout the trace and forward propagation of information detected in the first frames , such as fluorophore detection or bleaching , to the predictions for later frames . By collapsing the per-trace confusion matrix into a binary ‘smFRET’ and ‘non-smFRET’ ( as shown by the cross-lines in Figure 3b ) , DeepFRET was found to be very balanced overall , with a true-positive rate of 94% for smFRET traces , and a true-negative rate of non-smFRET traces ( Figure 3c ) , resulting in an overall balanced classification accuracy of 94% for the ALEX-enabled model and 93% for the ALEX-disabled model . We then compared the classification accuracy of DeepFRET to the accuracy of three different human operators working with smFRET to evaluate the feasibility of manually inspecting and making decisions about smFRET examples . We simulated 1000 ground truth traces , of which only 46 contained actual smFRET , at different , randomly chosen levels of noise . The participants were neither informed about the underlying distribution nor the true number of smFRET traces . The test revealed that the average performance of the human operators , scoring 0 . 76 ± 0 . 10 in precision and 0 . 83 ± 0 . 14 in recall , was close to the precision-recall curve of the DNN , on a relatively small dataset ( Figure 3 , Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Notably , one participant scored slightly better than the model in both precision and recall but spent an average of 5 s per trace , which would significantly increase data treatment time , thus making this unfeasible in a high-throughput setting . The large spread on precision and recall attained by human operators on these data furthermore suggest a large possible spread in experimental outcomes and highlights the advantages of unifying , reproducible methodologies independent of human interventions . We , therefore , argue that DeepFRET is equally good , or better , as careful manual inspection while offering orders of magnitude faster data evaluation . The model’s generalizability was initially examined by evaluation on real experimental smFRET data previously published by us ( Stella et al . , 2018 ) . The selected published dataset contains thousands of traces that included aggregates and incomplete labeled molecules , due to low labeling efficiency . Our pre-screening ( using median stoichiometry and intensity distributions ) and subsequent manual inspection of the data resulted in 214 traces to exhibit smFRET . Applying our trained model with a threshold of 0 . 85 , without any other parameter tuning , recovered 228 traces , with a FRET distribution very closely matching manual selection ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . The DeepFRET score of human versus machine selection displays the importance of quantitative and reproducible assessment of trace scores ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . The total data evaluation time of <50 ms per trace ( on a recent laptop ) free of human intervention highlights the potential of DeepFRET to rapidly and reliably evaluate high throughput smFRET data . Most importantly , the trace selection is deterministic , strictly relies on the score threshold , and is thus independent of potential human cognitive bias . This demonstrates the ability of the DNN to generalize to a completely new set of experimental data , without any prior expectations for signal-to-noise ratio , anti-correlation , underlying FRET distribution , etc . , offering the possibility to rapidly analyze smFRET data for structural biology insights . To further evaluate the performance of DeepFRET we compared it to the existing , robust , and widely used software packages for classification and treatment of smFRET data , iSMS , and SPARTAN ( Juette et al . , 2016; Preus et al . , 2015 ) , as well as ebFRET and HAMMY that focus on the kinetic analysis ( McKinney et al . , 2006; van de Meent et al . , 2014 ) . The performance was initially tested on simulated , ground truth data and further evaluated on published and publicly available experimental data ( Kilic et al . , 2018; Hellenkamp et al . , 2018 ) . For the simulated data , 200 ground truth smFRET traces were merged with 1800 simulated , non-smFRET traces and sorted by the various software packages . SPARTAN and iSMS both have sophisticated tools for automated sorting of traces ( intensity , stoichiometry , and FRET thresholds in iSMS , and 26 parameter thresholds in SPARTAN including donor/acceptor correlation , SNR , intensity , FRET lifetime , and exclusion of photoblinking ) , while ebFRET and HAMMY relies on simple thresholds on the intensity and FRET . Here , practically the commonly used thresholds were employed in all software packages . DeepFRET was found to sort traces at least similarly to , or better than , both SPARTAN and iSMS without any parameter tuning , closely matching the underlying ground truth distribution , while ebFRET and HAMMY would require further sorting by manual selection or additional software packages for optimal results ( see Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . We then compared the performance of the three software packages offering advanced sorting on experimental data from other groups ( Kilic et al . , 2018; Hellenkamp et al . , 2018 ) . To ensure proper testing , the performance was evaluated on both ALEX and non-ALEX data . Our data show that all software packages were able to reproduce published FRET distributions from raw tif files with a little discrepancy ( see Figure 4—figure supplement 4 ) . We used practically the default settings in both software . We note that expert users are well trained to navigate through all thresholds and define their own to further , and even more accurately , optimize data selection . This task however may become more challenging on data where the ground truth distribution is unknown and fine-tuning parameters could be subject to bias , especially for non-specialized users . The use of a single threshold and thus minimal required expertise , offered by DeepFRET may be crucial for a greater number of scientists to take advantage of this tool . To ensure the facile operation of DeepFRET by non-machine learning experts and users without any programming skills , we provided a standalone executable along with simple and detailed instructions on how to use it ( see Materials and methods ) . DeepFRET implements and automates in a user-friendly and intuitive platform all common procedures for smFRET analysis: sophisticated raw image analysis from raw . tiff files; particle and signal detection and localization; pixel intensity extraction for each biomolecule on both spectral channels and background corrected fluorescence and FRET trace trajectories; automatic trace classification and sorting; unbiased analysis of number of FRET states based on BIC analysis; 2-channel fitting of idealized FRET traces using HMM analysis based on calculated number of states by BIC; data and statistical evaluation of abundance of FRET states and lifetimes; application of correction factors; and transition density plots ( see Figure 1 , Figure 1—figure supplements 9–11 ) . DeepFRET furthermore offers interoperability and backward-compatible trace loading from . txt files exported from the popular iSMS software package . The software can export all results to publication-ready quality figures and also allows the extraction of data for further user-specific downstream analysis if desired . The freely available open-source code and the underlying mathematical operations that are based on many commonly used packages ( e . g . NumPy , SciPy , Matplotlib ) will allow expert users to adjust features pipelining the analysis depending on their needs ( see Code Availability ) . The DNN model is trained using Keras/TensorFlow , one of the most popular frameworks for deep learning . While the DNN is pre-trained with DeepFRET , we also provide the option for simulating new data with additional parameters offering the possibility of DNN model re-training to meet the specialized needs of trained users ( e . g . multicolor FRET ) . The programming interface , on the other hand , allows the convenient implementation of additional scripts pipelining the analysis and to potentially expand it to additional single-molecule time-series analysis . 
 smFRET is a powerful toolkit , key for exploring dynamic structural biology , but to meet its full potential , automated standardized and user-independent analysis of data is essential . Because the experimental conditions , instruments , and biological systems drastically vary across laboratories , the treatment of data based on semi-automatic methods and simplified assumptions could yield different conclusions . DeepFRET is designed to fill this void and analyze data independently of any assumptions and reproducibly across laboratories . Our experiments show that a neural network classifier trained on purely simulated smFRET time-series accurately and efficiently recognizes and classifies smFRET both in simulated ground truth data and in a real-world dataset . DeepFRET classification accuracy consistently outperformed trace selection using commonly published thresholds . Similarly , it supersedes the selection accuracy of human operators and importantly , only requiring a fraction of the time ( minutes versus weeks if traces are manually selected ) . Such a drastic reduction of analysis times will allow the acquisition of even larger datasets expanding the field for high throughput analysis and improving the robustness of conclusion . The fact that DeepFRET does so only requiring a score threshold , as a sole human intervention , demonstrates its strength as a novel smFRET analysis method and its potential to form a reference against which the quality of the data and the structural biology insights are benchmarked . DeepFRET was found to perform accurately for both ALEX and non-ALEX smFRET data ( Figure 4 , Figure 4—figure supplements 3–4 ) highlighting its precise classification and applicability across laboratories and methods . The limited effect of human operators on data selection on the other hand illustrates its potential to contribute to the standardization of the field , increasing reproducibility across laboratories . We anticipate that DeepFRET , combined with the advent of commercial single-molecule instruments , will contribute in materializing the smFRET as a robust mainstream toolkit for structural biology labs . DeepFRET is currently trained and thoroughly tested to operate on 2-color ALEX and non-ALEX smFRET data . Other experimental techniques such as 3- and 4-color FRET ( Stein et al . , 2011; Yoo et al . , 2020 ) , protein-induced fluorescence enhancement ( PIFE; Hwang and Myong , 2014 ) , metal-induced energy transfer ( MIET; Chizhik et al . , 2014 ) or intraparticle surface energy transfer ( i-SET; Zhou et al . , 2020 ) could be implemented in the future through additional simulation of training data with subsequent DNN re-training and software optimization ( see Materials and methods and data availability for instructions ) . The simulation of data in DeepFRET is based on the assumption that protein dynamics as observed by smFRET follows a Markov process . Based on this assumption , practically any kind of experimental data can be simulated , using the implemented visual trace simulator , to meet specific requirements . This may include additional noise levels above 0 . 30 , transition probabilities larger than 0 . 2 , traces with more than 4 FRET states , slower or faster lifetimes that may be classified as noisy , etc . In its current version , DeepFRET operates on surface-immobilized particles only , however implementing single-particle tracking as described in Bohr et al . , 2019 would allow simultaneous tracking and extraction of dynamics through smFRET on freely diffusing particles open up exciting possibilities , for example , live cell imaging with single-particletracking ( Singh et al . , 2020 ) and in vivo high throughput smFRET studies ( White et al . , 2020 ) . DeepFRET’s neural network is trained to operate for smFRET data but our approach of time-series classification and sequence annotation can conveniently be extended to consider a spectrum of stochastic single-molecule trajectories of individual turnovers including tracking ( Bohr et al . , 2019; Ferro et al . , 2019; Lu et al . , 1998; Persson et al . , 2013 ) , constant force measurements ( Goldman et al . , 2015 ) and blinking of individual molecules ( Durisic et al . , 2014; Wang et al . , 2019 ) using either simulated or high-quality annotated experimental data for training . Consequently , we expect the neural network of DeepFRET or similar approaches to be a paradigm shift and enable new fully automated analysis methodologies related to biomolecular recognition , protein folding and dynamics , and super resolution . Such advances are paramount for increasing the breadth and impact of single-molecule studies to be fully exploited in structural biology . 
 Deep learning requires large amounts of diverse data in order to generalize well to unseen data . We have developed a method to generate the required thousands of ground truth traces to cover every type of empirically observed trace , with a dedicated user interface option ( Figure 1—figure supplements 2 and 6 ) . This algorithm includes the generation of TIRF-microscopy smFRET traces of ALEX or non-ALEX data . The traces sample any given FRET value with tunable dye photobleaching lifetime , signal noise , dye blinking , donor bleedthrough , aggregates ( i . e . more than one donor/acceptor fluorophore ) of any given size , as well as a ‘scrambling’ feature , to account for fluorophore phenomena that could not be classified as stemming from smFRET . In order to generate traces , for each pair , we first generate the underlying FRET states from an adjustable Hidden Markov model and assume unscaled unit-intensities for DD , DA , AA . Then , if the energy transferred is defined by ( 1 ) FRET=DA / ( DD+DA ) the remaining intensity of the donor is ( 2 ) DD=1−FRETand from ( 1 ) , the transferred intensity is ( 3 ) DA=− ( DD ∗ FRET ) / ( FRET−1 ) In a perfectly-aligned setup , one can expect that ( 4 ) DD + DA=AAsuch that the stoichiometry S will be exactly ( 5 ) S= ( DD+DA ) / ( DD+DA+AA ) =0 . 5 Initially , all fluorophores are simulated with an intensity of 1 ( with absolute scaling only adjusted after applying all other parameters ) . Additionally , the intensity of AA should always be 1 , regardless of the current FRET state . In practice , the AA intensity may not be exactly half of DD+DA ( and consequently one might observe S that deviates slightly from 0 . 5 ) . To account for this , we uniformly sample ‘AA-mismatch’ as a percentage of the unit intensity signal . Upon fluorophore photobleaching , with lifetimes sampled from an exponential distribution , either DD or DA/AA is set to 0 . Noise , AA-mismatch , and donor bleedthrough are added to the ground truth signals to obtain the observable DD , DA , and AA , we can calculate realistic , observable values for E and S . For each synthetic trace , the noise is drawn from a Normal ( μ = 0 , σ ) distribution of varying σ . We found that , on top of the normally distributed noise , we could add the noise from a ( centered ) Gamma ( k = 1 , θ = 1 . 1 ) distribution multiplied with the noise amplitude at each frame ( and is thus controlled via the noise parameter ) . This did not visually alter the spread of the distribution significantly but improved the robustness of predictions on real data , as we found empirically that the noise of experimental data never exactly followed a pure normal distribution . State-of-the-art neural networks can achieve human-like or better performance on a wide range of classification tasks . Recently , however , it has been demonstrated how small modifications to the input can lead to wildly inaccurate outputs ( Goodfellow et al . , 2014 ) . During the development of our smFRET classification model , we observed how photophysical artifacting ( described as ‘interesting effects’ by TJ Ha’s group [Roy et al . , 2008] ) would lead the model to make confident yet very inaccurate predictions to fix this , our trace generation algorithm contains extensive ‘scrambling’; we found that by randomly flipping one of the channels , creating strong correlations by multiplication of the channels or adding bursts of high noise and long dark states we could avoid ‘adversarial-like’ predictions . We note that scrambled data is not meant to mimic observable data but instead to make the model robust against mispredictions on highly aberrant data that does not fall into the other observable categories . We generated ground truth traces , where every frame of the sequence was labeled as one of five categories: ‘ ( B ) bleached’ , ‘ ( A ) aggregate’ , ‘ ( N ) noisy’ , ‘ ( X ) scrambled’ , ‘ ( S ) static smFRET’ , or ‘ ( D ) dynamic smFRET’ ( see Figure 1—figure supplements 5–7 ) . Additionally , we applied label smoothing with a strength of 0 . 05 , as this has been shown to greatly improve model robustness and prediction confidence ( Shafahi et al . , 2019 ) . A central element of model training is the uniform sampling of the infinite number of possible permutations of FRET data ( FRET states , occupancies , lifetimes , transition pathways , and noise ) . For training the model , we set the following parameters ( easily adjustable in the interface , see Figure 1—figure supplement 6 ) : With these parameters , directly applicable as input for the algorithm ( see Code availability ) , we randomly initially generated 250 . 000 traces of 300 frames each of randomized configurations . We then under-sampled data to balance the labels ( as neural network classifiers perform worse if trained on highly class-imbalanced datasets ) based on the first frame of each trace . This resulted in approximately 150 , 000 traces , roughly equally distributed over the five possible classes ( bleaching being present in most traces naturally ends up accounting for a higher fraction of the overall frames ) . We used 80% for training the classifier and the remaining 20% for validation . After the training procedure , we generated an additional test set with 33 . 000 new traces and under-sampled it as previously , to roughly 20 . 000 traces , and based our statistical analysis on those alone . We supplied only the raw features DD , DA , and AA to the model ( or only DD and DA for the non-ALEX-enabled model ) , where for each trace , signals were normalized to the max of all signals in that trace to preserve the relative intensities between donor and acceptor . In this way , predictions done on individual smFRET traces are fully independent from every other in a given experiment , and also independent of non-standardized instrument intensity units ( i . e . ‘arbitrary units’ ) . An LSTM-RNN ( long short-term memory recurrent neural network ) classifier was implemented in Keras with TensorFlow as backend . The structure of the network ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) was inspired by a recent sequence classifier for ECG time-series ( Hannun et al . , 2019 ) that employs both skip connections and batch normalization as means to prevent overfitting . Here we replaced the global pooling layer with stride-1 max pooling layers , and added a bidirectional LSTM layer before the final fully connected layer , which we found lead to more temporally causal and context-sensitive predictions ( e . g . if the model spots multiple bleaching steps in the beginning of a trace , this information is propagated throughout , so the whole trace can be confidently marked as aggregated ) . Each residual block ( ‘Res’ in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) contains n = 2x filters , where x is five and is incremented by 1 at every 4th block . The kernel size k starts from 16 and is reduced by 4 at every 4th Res block , so as to learn larger-scale features and gradually smaller ones . The initial convolution has the same hyper-parameters as the first residual block . A 1 × k convolution is added in each residual block for efficiency ( He et al . , 2016 ) . To avoid problems with vanishing gradients throughout such a deep model , each residual block keeps a copy of the input vector and adds it to the output vector ( denoted by the ‘+” symbol ) . The long short-term memory ( LSTM ) cell is bidirectional and contains 16 units , and has a dropout rate of 0 . 4 applied to the outputs . For each frame , the outputs are distributed among six different classes by a dense layer with softmax activation . The model loss was minimized in batches of 32 samples with the Adam optimizer , using the default parameters and the default learning rate of 0 . 001 . The learning rate was decreased by a factor of 10 if validation loss showed no improvement over two consecutive epochs . The training was stopped early if no improvement in the validation loss was observed over five consecutive epochs . Convolutional kernels were initialized as proposed by He et al . , 2015 . Other layer configurations were left at their Keras defaults . The final model output is passed through a softmax layer , thus that for each frame the probabilities between all classes sum up to exactly 1 . Further experimentation with optimizers and learning rates showed no significant improvement over the above configuration .

Here' key takeaways include :    Fovea Density:      Longer Eyes Have Higher Sampling Densities: Contrary conventional wisdom suggesting wider gaps among elongated eyeballs lead improved peripheral clarity ; instead finding denser arrangements exist despite stretches occurring mainly outside rather inside them.. These outcomes challenge assumptions regarding optimal placement amidst physiological limitations imposed via lateral shifts induced throughout life span evolution designed protect against deterioration arising solely because excessive accommodation demands energy expenditure while minimizing risk factors like glare discomfort experienced under poor lighting conditions.(Abstract)      Key Findings         • Peak ConelDensity drops sharply wtihAxial Length, confirming prior reports yet revealing preserved macular sensitivity up until substantial distances beyond normal viewing ranges (~upwards ∼one hundred millimeters).        • Myopias tend exhibit lower overall rod denisty however maintain comparable resolving ability thanks largely attributed tot eh preservation mechanism mentioned above( Abstract ).

The retina is the light sensitive tissue at the back of the eye , and it contains the fovea , the region that provides the clearest vision . Light must be focused on the retina to create images , a feat achieved by the transparent parts at the front of the eye called the cornea and lens . These parts of the eye are called the optics . Between birth and adulthood , significant changes take place in the eye . Most noticeably , the distance between the optics and the fovea grows by about seven millimeters . Cells called cone photoreceptors , which provide light sensitivity , migrate and pack into the fovea . Finally , the eye’s optics adjust to maintain a sharp focus . At the same time , the brain is learning how to process inputs from the eyes to generate mental images that realistically correspond to the physical world around it . The development of the eye is fascinating in its complexity , but for more and more people , the process does not go as expected . Specifically , a growing proportion of the population has eyes that are too long . This means that , for light reflected by far away objects , the eye’s optics form an image in front of the retina instead of on it . As a result , images of distant objects cannot be seen clearly , a condition known as myopia or nearsightedness . Researchers have also discovered that nearsighted people see less clearly than those who do not use glasses , even when given a sharp image to examine at close range . It has been hypothesized that these deficits result from stretching of the retina as the eye becomes bigger . Until recently , testing this hypothesis by looking at cone photoreceptors directly in the eye was impossible . This is because the optics of all eyes have small imperfections that distort the light passing through them , including any light used to take high resolution microscopic images of the fovea . This hurdle can be overcome using adaptive optics , which means adding a deformable mirror to the instrument being used to image the eye that can adjust to correct the distortion . Wang et al . use a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to check the density of cones at the fovea in relation to the size of the eye . They show that although the center of the fovea has fewer cones when the eye is bigger , this effect is more than offset because the longer eye increases magnification . So , if a near-sighted person wearing contacts and someone who does not need glasses stood side-by-side admiring the full moon , the near-sighted person would most likely have more cones sampling the image and should therefore have a higher resolution view . These findings rule out reductions in the density of cone photoreceptors as the cause or effect of visual deficits associated with near-sightedness , adding to the understanding of this common condition .","We provide the first measures of foveal cone density as a function of axial length in living eyes and discuss the physical and visual implications of our findings . We used a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects . Cone density and other metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal units . The foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea , but not in proportion to eye length . Despite retinal stretching ( decrease in cones/mm2 ) , myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density ( increase in cones/deg2 ) in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes , offering the potential for better visual acuity . Reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes compared to emmetropes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression . 
 One might expect that eye growth would stretch the photoreceptor layer and would increase the spacing between cones , causing a longer eye to more coarsely sample an image relative to a shorter eye . However the situation is not that simple; the axial elongation associated with eye growth is accompanied by magnification of the retinal image ( Strang et al . , 1998 ) . If the enlargement of the retinal image exactly matched the stretching of the cone mosaic , then eyes of different lengths would sample the visual field similarly . In fact , in large scale studies , myopes generally attain reasonably good visual acuity with optical correction ( He et al . , 2004; Jong et al . , 2018 ) . However , more careful inspection reveals that myopes generally ( 6 out of 9 studies ) have poorer angular resolution and have uniformly ( 3 out of 3 studies ) poorer retinal resolution . Table 1 summarizes published results from psychophysical foveal tasks . Most notably , Atchison et al . ( 2006 ) and Coletta and Watson ( 2006 ) show clear deficits in retinal resolution ( cyc/mm ) with increasing myopia using interferometric methods which bypass the optics of the eye and Rossi et al . ( 2007 ) show significant deficits in angular resolution ( cyc/deg ) in low myopes , even after using adaptive optics to correct for optical blur . All studies that find myopic visual deficits implicate retinal stretching as a possible cause , but what is actually happening structurally at the foveal center during myopic progression is not known . Therefore , the aim of the current study is to more carefully investigate how the length of the eye affects cone density at and near the foveal center . Two types of cone densities will be discussed in this study . Linear density quantifies how many cones are within a fixed area , in square mm , and serves as a way to evaluate physical retinal stretching caused by eye growth . Angular density quantifies how many cones are within one degree visual angle , ( the visual angle on the retina is measured from the secondary nodal point of the eye ) . Angular density serves as a way to evaluate the visual implications of eye growth as it governs the sampling resolution of the eye . Figure 1 illustrates three models , along the lines of Strang et al . ( 1998 ) , of how photoreceptor structure might be affected by myopic eye growth . In the first model , called the global expansion model , the retina is proportionally stretched with increasing axial length - cones are more spaced out in longer eyes - and linear density decreases with eye length . Assuming that the secondary nodal point remains at a fixed position relative to the anterior segment , the number of cones within a fixed angular area will remain constant . Therefore , angular cone density will be constant with eye length . In the second model , called the equatorial stretching model , the posterior retina simply moves axially further from the anterior segment of the eye so that the linear density does not change with eye length . Since the retina is moving further from the secondary nodal point , more cones will fall within a fixed angular area and the angular cone density will increase with eye length . The final model , called the over-development model , describes a structural photoreceptor change that mimics the changes that occur during development ( Springer and Hendrickson , 2004 ) whereby the photoreceptors continue to migrate towards the fovea as the eye grows . In this scenario , longer eyes will show both increased linear cone density and an even steeper increase in angular cone density . The model is motivated by observations of increased linear cone density in the foveas of marmosets that underwent lens-induced eye growth ( Troilo , 1998 ) . The most definitive studies of cone spacing as a function of axial length are done through direct imaging of the retina – wherein sharp images of the cones are enabled through the use of adaptive optics , a set of technologies that actively compensate the blur caused by aberrations of the eye ( Liang et al . , 1997 ) . Combined with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy ( Webb et al . , 1987 ) , adaptive optics offers the highest contrast en face images of the foveal photoreceptor mosaic ever recorded in vivo ( Dubra et al . , 2011; Roorda et al . , 2002 ) . Despite continued advances in image quality , previous studies investigating cone packing and eye length have not made their measurements at the foveal center , the most important region for spatial vision but the most difficult to image owing to the small size of photoreceptors . There are a number of studies on cone packing and eye length ( Chui et al . , 2008; Elsner et al . , 2017; Kitaguchi et al . , 2007; Li et al . , 2010; Obata and Yanagi , 2014; Park et al . , 2013 ) and here we summarize the published results that are most relevant to our study . Chui et al . ( 2008 ) investigated angular and linear cone density at 1 mm and three degrees eccentricity . They found a significant decrease ( p<0 . 05 ) in linear cone density as a function of eye length at 1 mm ( which , by angular distance , is closer to the fovea in a longer eye than in a shorter eye ) in all directions except in the nasal retina . They found that the angular cone density at three degrees ( which , by linear distance , is closer to the fovea , in a shorter eye than in a longer eye ) increased with eye length , but the trends were not significant . Li et al . ( 2010 ) made similar measures , but closer to the fovea ( from 0 . 10 mm to 0 . 30 mm eccentricity ) . They found that linear cone density decreased with eye length , but the trends were not significant at the smallest eccentricities ( 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 mm ) . When the data were plotted in angular units and angular distance from the fovea , they found that angular cone density trended toward an increase with eye length but none of the trends were significant . A more recent study measured peak cone densities in the fovea as well as axial length for 22 eyes of 22 subjects ( Wilk et al . , 2017 ) but they did not plot peak cone density as a function of axial length , as it was not the aim of their study . We plotted the data they provided in their paper and found that the linear cone density at the foveal center dropped significantly with increases in axial length , similar to what was found by Li et al . ( 2010 ) and Chui et al . ( 2008 ) , but the angular cone density had no dependency on eye length . Summary plots from previous literature are shown in Figure 2AB . Wilk et al . ( 2017 ) ’s data were consistent with a global expansion model and Li et al . ( 2010 ) and Chui et al . ( 2008 ) ’s data only leaned toward a model that falls between the global expansion and equatorial stretching models . If the trends found by Li et al . ( 2010 ) and Chui et al . ( 2008 ) near the fovea were to extend to the foveal center , then myopes would have higher foveal photoreceptor sampling resolution with a consequent potential for better performance on visual tasks compared to emmetropes . As such , the simplest explanation for visual deficits in myopes – increased separation between cones caused by retinal stretching – would have to be ruled out . With the improvements in resolution of adaptive optics ophthalmoscopes , imaging the smallest cones at the foveal center is now possible in many eyes , enabling a definitive analysis of the cone density at the fovea as a function of eye length . 
 All the biometric measures used to convert angular dimensions to linear retinal dimensions are listed on Table 2 . The strong correlation between refractive error and eye length ( p<0 . 0001 ) indicates that the myopia in this cohort was predominantly as a result of axial length . Images of the foveal region , the preferred retinal locus for fixation ( PRL ) and the fixation stability were recorded with an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope ( see Materials and methods ) . The image of one subject ( 10003L ) is shown in Figure 3A . All the cones were resolved with our imaging system . The scatter plot indicates the scatter plot of fixation over the course of a 10 s video . Figure 3B shows the same image with all cones labeled and a color-coded overlay indicating the density . 16 , 184 labeled cones are shown on the figure . The point of maximum density is indicated by the black cross and the PRL is indicated by the yellow ellipse ( best fit to the scatter plot locations in Figure 3A ) . This eye has a peak linear density of 204 , 020 cones/mm² , and a peak angular density of 15 , 851 cones/deg² . Cone density plots in linear and angular units for all eyes are shown on Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2 . Original images and a list of the cone locations for each can be downloaded from the Dryad Digital Repository https://datadryad . org/review ? doi=doi:10 . 5061/dryad . nh0fp1b . Figure 4 shows the linear cone density as a function of linear eccentricity , where the average linear cone density was computed in 25-micron wide annuli centered around the point of peak density . Figure 4—figure supplement 1 are plots of the average cone densities in linear and angular units as a function of eccentricity in microns and arcminutes . Figure 4—figure supplement 2 are plots of the average linear and angular cone densities as a function of horizontal and vertical direction . In order to show the trends of density with axial length Figure 5A and B plot linear and angular cone density as a function of axial length where the colors indicate different eccentricity - red to purple indicate distance from the from fovea towards more parafoveal locations . Figure 5A reveals that peak linear density decreases significantly with axial length and the trend persists and remains significant from the fovea out to 100 microns eccentricity . Axial length accounts for 39% of the variance in the changes in linear cone density . Figure 5B shows the opposite trends when plotted in angular units . Peak angular density increases significantly with axial length and the trend persists and remains significant out to 40 arcminutes eccentricity . Axial length accounts for 32% of the variance in the changes in angular cone density . The plots clearly indicate that although stretching does occur ( Figure 5A ) it is not a simple global expansion and longer eyes have higher sampling density . The trends hold at and around fovea with statistical significance . A more relevant measure of the impact of eye length on vision is how the angular cone density changes at the PRL , which is often displaced from the location of peak cone density ( Li et al . , 2010; Putnam et al . , 2005; Wilk et al . , 2017 ) . If , for example , longer eyes had more displaced PRLs then that could diminish , or even reverse , the trend of increased angular density with eye length reported in Figure 5B . We found that the average displacement between PRL and maximum cone density was 6 . 1 arcminutes and 30 . 4 microns . There was no significant linear relationship found between PRL displacement in either angular or linear units vs . axial length . Therefore , the PRL was not more displaced in myopes than in emmetropes from the point of peak cone density . Plots of the cone density at the PRL with axial length show the same trend at the PRL as at the point of maximum cone density ( Figure 6A and B ) . Finally , we explored whether fixational eye movements might have a dependency on axial length . Fixation stability around the PRL had an average standard deviation of 3 . 94 arcminutes and 19 . 84 microns . The average area of the best fitting ellipse containing ~68% of the points in the scatterplot ( defined as the bivariate contour ellipse area , or BCEA ) was 50 . 7 square arcminutes and 1303 square microns . The plot of BCEA in square microns vs . axial length vs . showed a trend that approached significance ( p=0 . 0596 ) ( Figure 7A ) , but when we plotted BCEA in square arcminutes vs . axial length , the trend was no longer apparent ( p=0 . 364 ) ( Figure 7B ) . In other words , if there is any increase in fixational eye movements in microns , it is just a symptom of having a longer eye . 
 We used our latest generation adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope ( AOSLO ) for foveal imaging . The system used a mirror-based , out-of-plane optical design ( Dubra et al . , 2011 ) , and employed a deformable mirror with a continuous membrane surface and shaped with 97 actuators ( DM97 , ALPAO , Montbonnot-Saint-Martin , France ) . The system scans multiple wavelengths simultaneously . Each wavelength was drawn from the same broadband supercontinuum source ( SuperK EXTREME , NKT Photonics , Birkerod , Denmark ) using a custom-built fiber coupler . Wave aberrations were measured with a custom-built Shack Hartmann wavefront sensor using the 940 nm channel . Images were recorded using the 680 nm channel . 512 × 512 pixel videos were recorded over a 0 . 9 × 0 . 9 degree square field for an average sampling resolution of 9 . 48 pixels per arcminute . Eye alignment and head stabilization was achieved by using either a bite bar or a chin rest with temple pads . At least one 10 s video was recorded at the fovea and at eight more locations where the subjects were instructed to fixate on the corners and sides of the raster , to image an entire foveal region spanning about 1 . 8 × 1 . 8 degrees . In order to ensure the best possible focus of the foveal cones , multiple videos were taken over a range of 0 . 05 D defocus steps to find the sharpest foveal cones . Focus steps were generated by adding a focus shape onto the deformable mirror . Online stabilization and registration algorithms were used to facilitate rapid feedback on the image quality . Steady fixation was achieved at the fovea center by having the subjects fixate on a dark , circular , blinking dot with a diameter of 3 . 16 arcminutes ( 30 pixels ) in the center of the AOSLO scanning raster . The fixation target was generated by modulating the same 680 nm scanning beam used for imaging and , as such , the target’s location was encoded directly into each frame of the video ( Poonja et al . , 2005 ) . A scatter plot of the positions of the blinking dot relative to the retina was generated and was fit with a bivariate ellipse using free online MATLAB scripts downloaded from http://www . visiondummy . com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/error_ellipse . m . The bivariate contour ellipse area ( BCEA ) , which is the area of the best-fitting ellipse encompassing 68% of the points in the scatterplot ( Castet and Crossland , 2012 ) was used to quantify the fixation stability ( Figure 7 ) and the exact location of the PRL within the imaged cone mosaic ( Table 2 , Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2 ) . High quality images were generated from the recorded videos offline using custom software ( MATLAB , The MathWorks , Inc , Natick , MA ) to measure and correct for distortions caused by eye movements ( Stevenson and Roorda , 2005 ) . An open source version of the code is posted at https://github . com/lowvisionresearch/ReVAS ( Agaoglu et al . , 2018; copy archived at https://github . com/elifesciences-publications/ReVAS ) . Poor-quality frames were manually excluded and registered frames were averaged into a single high signal-to-noise image . The processed images were stitched together ( Photoshop; Adobe Systems , Inc , Mountain View , CA ) to create an approximately 1 . 8-degree montage of the foveal cone mosaic . We used custom software to identify and label individual cones in the AO retinal images . The program allows the user to select a region of interest and manually add and delete cone labels . A combination of both manual and automated methods ( Li and Roorda , 2007 ) were used to identify cone locations as the current version of the program does not adequately recognize cones in the foveal center where they are dim and smaller ( Li et al . , 2010 ) . All the cone coordinates were selected and reviewed by two of the authors . In some cases cones were too dim to be seen but there was only a gap in the mosaic ( Bruce et al . , 2015 ) . If a space that might have been occupied by a cone was dim or dark , we would assume it was a cone and mark its location . We rationalize this for two reasons: First , if there is a gap in the mosaic , then it is likely that a cell is occupying that space , otherwise the adjacent cells would migrate to fill it in ( Scoles et al . , 2014 ) . Second , in our experience and of others ( Pallikaris et al . , 2003 ) , cones that appear dark in one visit , can often appear bright in the next . In other cases ( uncommon ) the contrast was low in some regions or there were interference artifacts in the images ( Meadway and Sincich , 2018; Putnam et al . , 2010 ) , making the cone locations slightly ambiguous . In these instances , we made manual cone selections based on the assumption that the cones were all similar in size and close-packed into a nearly hexagonal array ( Curcio et al . , 1990 ) . Continuous density maps were generated by computing cone density within a circular cone sampling window of 10 arcminutes in diameter around every pixel location across the image . All cones whose centers fell on or within the boundary of the sampling window were counted . The size of the cone sampling windows was chosen for several reasons . First , it encompasses the typical range of eye motion during a typical fixation task . Second , the area was large enough to generate smooth maps , but small enough to resolve local changes . Smaller cone sampling windows showed slightly higher densities ( see Discussion ) but were also associated with more variability in the identification of the location of peak cone density . Changes in density with eccentricity were generated by computing the density in five-arcminute annuli surrounding the point of peak cone density . For linear density measures we used annuli with 25-micron widths . The exact angular dimensions of the AOSLO images were computed by imaging a calibrated model eye in the AOSLO system , but the conversion to linear dimensions on the retinal image requires additional measurements , since the dimensions of each eye governs the actual size of the image on its retina . The conversion from visual angle to retinal distance requires a measurement of the axial length of the eye and an estimation of the location of the secondary nodal point . We did paraxial ray tracing , described by Li et al . ( 2010 ) , in a four-surface schematic eye model to estimate the location of the secondary nodal point . The corneal first surface radius of curvature , the anterior chamber depth and the axial length were measured for each subject with an IOL Master ( Zeiss Meditec , Dublin , CA ) . The radius of the curvature of the back surface of the cornea was computed as 88 . 31% of the front surface as per the Gullstrand eye model ( Bennett et al . , 1994 ) . The indices of refraction of the media and the radii of curvature of the front and back lens surface were taken from the Gullstrand schematic eye ( Vojniković and Tamajo , 2013 ) . Once determined , retinal image size is related to visual angle by the equation:I=tan ( 1∘ ) ( x−AN′ ) θ Where I is retinal image size , x is axial length , AN’ is the distance from the corneal apex to the eye’s second nodal point , and θ is the visual angle . As can be seen in Table 2 , myopic eyes , which generally have longer focal lengths , have proportionally larger retinal images . Other methods to compute the retinal magnification factor ( RMF ) might have been used . We did a paraxial ray trace to find the secondary nodal point using lens parameters from a 6-surface Gullstrand eye model , and found that the RMFs were essentially identical . When we computed the RMF using an equation proposed by Bennett et al . ( 1994 ) we found that the RMF was overestimated for hyperopic eyes and underestimated for myopic eyes . This discrepancy arises from the fact that Bennett’s equation is based on the assumption that the focal point of the eye’s optics coincides with the retina , which it does not ( Li et al . , 2010 ) . Despite this known error , when we redid the analysis using RMFs computed using the Bennett et al . ( 1994 ) equation , we still found a significant trend of reducing linear density with axial length , but only at the position of peak cone density . Of course , all the angular density calculations are unaffected by differences in the RMF . Given the trends of increased angular density as a function of axial length that Li et al . ( 2010 ) observed at the location closest to the fovea ( slope = 531 cones/deg2 for each mm increase in axial length; standard deviation of the regression errors = 1377 cones/deg2 ) , we estimated that data from approximately 32 eyes , evenly distributed across a range of axial lengths would be sufficient to show if there was a true effect at the fovea . The targeted number was computed using methods outlined by Dupont and Plummer ( 1998 ) implemented using free online software ( Power and Sample Size Program Version 3 . 0 , January 2009 , downloaded from http://biostat . mc . vanderbilt . edu/wiki/Main/PowerSampleSize ) with type one error probability of 0 . 05 and a power of 0 . 95 . All data collected in this study were analyzed using simple linear regression models in Excel . p-values for all linear regressions are reported and linear trendlines with p-values less than 0 . 05 are plotted as solid lines and p-values greater than 0 . 05 as dashed lines . In this study , we included both the right and left eyes of some of the subjects . When we reran the statistics with a single eye from each subject ( n = 16 ) , the results were essentially the same and the same conclusions could be drawn .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Materials and methods']",['neuroscience'],elife-47148-v1,220,4241,4021,19.277272727272727

This may be partly due to genetics , but most differences in height between countries have other causes . For example , children and adolescents who are malnourished , or who suffer from serious diseases , will generally be shorter as adults . This is important because taller people generally live longer , are less likely to suffer from heart disease and stroke , and taller women and their children are less likely to have complications during and after birth . Taller people may also earn more and be more successful at school . However , they are also more likely to develop some cancers . The NCD Risk Factor Collaboration set out to find out how tall people are , on average , in every country in the world at the moment , and how this has changed over the past 100 years . The analysis revealed large differences in height between countries . The tallest men were born in the last part of the 20th century in the Netherlands , and were nearly 183 cm tall on average . The shortest women were born in 1896 in Guatemala , and were on average 140 cm tall . The difference between the shortest and tallest countries is about 20 cm for both men and women . This means there are large differences between countries in terms of nutrition and the risk of developing some diseases . The way in which height has changed over the past 100 years also varies from country to country . Iranian men born in 1996 were around 17 cm taller than those born in 1896 , and South Korean women were 20 cm taller . In other parts of the world , particularly in South Asia and parts of Africa , people are only slightly taller than 100 years ago , and in some countries people are shorter than they were 50 years ago . There is a need to better understand why height has changed in different countries by different amounts , and use this information to improve nutrition and health across the world . It would also be valuable to understand how much becoming taller has been responsible for improved health and longevity throughout the world .","Being taller is associated with enhanced longevity , and higher education and earnings . We reanalysed 1472 population-based studies , with measurement of height on more than 18 . 6 million participants to estimate mean height for people born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries . The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men , who became 20 . 2 cm ( 95% credible interval 17 . 5–22 . 7 ) and 16 . 5 cm ( 13 . 3–19 . 7 ) taller , respectively . In contrast , there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis . The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of 20th century , whose average heights surpassed 182 . 5 cm , and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 ( 140 . 3 cm; 135 . 8–144 . 8 ) . The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19-20 cm a century ago , and has remained the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries . 
 Being taller is associated with enhanced longevity , lower risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases , and higher risk of some cancers ( Paajanen et al . , 2010; Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration , 2012; Green et al . , 2011; Nelson et al . , 2015; Batty et al . , 2010; World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research , 2007; 2010; 2011; 2012; 2014a; 2014b; Nüesch et al . , 2015; Davies et al . , 2015; Zhang et al . , 2015; Kozuki et al . , 2015; Black et al . , 2008 ) . There is also evidence that taller people on average have higher education , earnings , and possibly even social position ( Adair et al . , 2013; Stulp et al . , 2015; Barker et al . , 2005; Strauss and Thomas , 1998; Chen and Zhou , 2007; Case and Paxson , 2008 ) . Although height is one of the most heritable human traits ( Fisher , 1919; Lettre , 2011 ) , cross-population differences are believed to be related to non-genetic , environmental factors . Of these , foetal growth ( itself related to maternal size , nutrition and environmental exposures ) , and nutrition and infections during childhood and adolescence are particularly important determinants of height during adulthood ( Cole , 2000; Silventoinen et al . , 2000; Dubois et al . , 2012; Haeffner et al . , 2002; Sørensen et al . , 1999; Victora et al . , 2008; Eveleth and Tanner , 1990; Tanner , 1962; Tanner , 1992; Bogin , 2013 ) . Information on height , and its trends , can therefore help understand the health impacts of childhood and adolescent nutrition and environment , and of their social , economic , and political determinants , on both non-communicable diseases ( NCDs ) and on neonatal health and survival in the next generation ( Cole , 2000; Tanner , 1992; Tanner , 1987 ) . Trends in men’s height have been analysed in Europe , the USA , and Japan for up to 250 years , using data on conscripts , voluntary military personnel , convicts , or slaves ( Cole , 2000; Floud et al . , 1990; Fogel et al . , 1983; Schmidt et al . , 1995; Floud et al . , 2011; Tanner et al . , 1982; Hatton and Bray , 2010; Tanner , 1981; Facchini and Gualdi-Russo , 1982 ) . There are fewer historical data for women , and for other regions where focus has largely been on children and where adult data tend to be reported at one point in time or over short periods ( Subramanian et al . , 2011; Grasgruber et al . , 2014; Baten and Blum , 2012; Deaton , 2007; Mamidi et al . , 2011; van Zanden et al . , 2014 ) . In this paper , we pooled worldwide population-based data to estimate height in adulthood for men and women born over a whole century throughout the world . 
 We estimated that people born in 1896 were shortest in Asia and in Central and Andean Latin America ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ) . The 1896 male birth cohort on average measured only 152 . 9 cm ( credible interval 147 . 9–157 . 9 ) in Laos , which is the same as a well-nourished 12 . 5-year boy according to international growth standards ( de Onis et al . , 2007 ) , followed by Timor-Leste and Guatemala . Women born in the same year in Guatemala were on average 140 . 3 cm ( 135 . 8–144 . 8 ) , the same as a well-nourished 10-year girl . El Salvador , Peru , Bangladesh , South Korea and Japan had the next shortest women . The tallest populations a century ago lived in Central and Northern Europe , North America and some Pacific islands . The height of men born in Sweden , Norway and the USA surpassed 171 cm , ~18–19 cm taller than men in Laos . Swedish women , with average adult height of 160 . 3 cm ( 158 . 2–162 . 4 ) , were the tallest a century ago and 20 cm taller than women in Guatemala . Women were also taller than 158 cm in Norway , Iceland , the USA and American Samoa . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 003Figure 1 . Adult height for the 1896 and 1996 birth cohorts for men .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 004 Changes in adult height over the century of analysis varied drastically across countries . Notably , although the large increases in European men’s heights in the 19th and 20th century have been highlighted , we found that the largest gains since the 1896 birth cohort occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men , who became 20 . 2 cm ( 17 . 5–22 . 7 ) and 16 . 5 cm ( 13 . 3–19 . 7 ) taller , respectively ( Figure 3 , Figure 4 and Figure 5 ) . As a result , South Korean women moved from the fifth shortest to the top tertile of tallest women in the world over the course of a century . Men in South Korea also had large gains relative to other countries , by 15 . 2 cm ( 12 . 3–18 . 1 ) . There were also large gains in height in Japan , Greenland , some countries in Southern Europe ( e . g . , Greece ) and Central Europe ( e . g . , Serbia and Poland , and for women Czech Republic ) . In contrast , there was little gain in height in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 005Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 007 The pace of growth in height has not been uniform over the past century . The impressive rise in height in Japan stopped in people born after the early 1960s ( Figure 6 ) . In South Korea , the flattening began in the cohorts born in the 1980s for men and it may have just begun in women . As a result , South Korean men and women are now taller than their Japanese counterparts . The rise is continuing in other East and Southeast Asian countries like China and Thailand , with Chinese men and women having surpassed the Japanese ( but not yet as tall as South Koreans ) . The rise in adult height also seems to have plateaued in South Asian countries like Bangladesh and India at much lower levels than in East Asia , e . g . , 5–10 cm shorter than it did in Japan and South Korea . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 008Figure 6 .

The solid line and shaded area show estimated height at 18 years of age , while the data points show height at the actual age of measurement . The divergence between estimates and data for earlier birth cohorts is because participants from these birth cohorts were generally older when their heights were measured . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 008 There were also variations in the time course of height change across high-income western countries , with height increase having plateaued in Northern European countries like Finland and in English-speaking countries like the UK for 2–3 decades ( Larnkaer et al . , 2006; Schönbeck et al . , 2013 ) , followed by Eastern Europe ( Figure 7 ) . The earliest of these occurred in the USA , which was one of the tallest nations a century ago but has now fallen behind its European counterparts after having had the smallest gain in height of any high-income country ( Tanner , 1981; Komlos and Lauderdale , 2007; Komlos and Baur , 2004; Sokoloff and Villaflor , 1982 ) . In contrast , height is still increasing in some Southern European countries ( e . g . , Spain ) , and in many countries in Latin America . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 009Figure 7 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 009 As an exception to the steady gains in most countries , adult height decreased or at best remained the same in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa for cohorts born after the early 1960s , by around 5 cm from its peak in some countries ( see for example Niger , Rwanda , Sierra Leone , and Uganda in Figure 8 ) . More recently , the same seems to have happened for men , but not women , in some countries in Central Asia ( e . g . , Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan ) and Middle East and North Africa ( e . g . , Egypt and Yemen ) , whereas in others ( e . g . , Iran ) both sexes continue to grow taller . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 010Figure 8 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 010 Men born in 1996 surpass average heights of 181 cm in the Netherlands , Belgium , Estonia , Latvia and Denmark , with Dutch men , at 182 . 5 cm ( 180 . 6–184 . 5 ) , the tallest people on the planet . The gap with the shortest countries – Timor-Leste , Yemen and Laos , where men are only ~160 cm tall – is 22–23 cm , an increase of ~4 cm on the global gap in the 1896 birth cohort . Australia was the only non-European country where men born in 1996 were among the 25 tallest in the world . Women born in 1996 are shortest in Guatemala , with an average height of 149 . 4 cm ( 148 . 0–150 . 8 ) , and are shorter than 151 cm in the Philippines , Bangladesh and Nepal . The tallest women live in Latvia , the Netherlands , Estonia and Czech Republic , with average height surpassing 168 cm , creating a 20 cm global gap in women’s height ( Figure 5 ) . Male and female heights were correlated across countries in 1896 as well as in 1996 . Men were taller than women in every country , on average by ~11 cm in the 1896 birth cohort and ~12 cm in the 1996 birth cohort ( Figure 9 ) . In the 1896 birth cohort , the male-female height gap in countries where average height was low was slightly larger than in taller nations . In other words , at the turn of the 20th century , men seem to have had a relative advantage over women in undernourished compared to better-nourished populations . A century later , the male-female height gap is about the same throughout the height range . Changes in male and female heights over the century of analysis were also correlated , which is in contrast to low correlation between changes in male and female BMIs as reported elsewhere ( NCD Risk Factor Collaboration , 2016 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 011Figure 9 .

Countries like Japan , Singapore and France had larger-than-median gains in height but little change in BMI , in contrast to places like the USA and Kiribati where height has increased less than the worldwide median while BMI has increased a great deal . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 012Figure 10 .

BMI data were available for 1975–2014 ( NCD Risk Factor Collaboration , 2016 ) ; 45–49 year olds in these years correspond to 1928–1967 birth cohorts . BMI data were from a pooled analysis of 1698 population-based measurement studies with 19 . 2 million participants , with details reported elsewhere ( NCD Risk Factor Collaboration , 2016 ) .

 We found that over the past century adult height has changed substantially and unevenly in the world’s countries , with no indication of convergence across countries . The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was ~19 cm for men and ~20 cm for women a century ago , and has remained about the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries in terms of adult height . Data from military conscripts and personnel have allowed reconstructing long-term trends in height in some European countries and the USA , albeit largely for men , and treating it as a 'mirror' to social and environmental conditions that affect nutrition , health and economic prosperity , in each generation and across generations ( Tanner , 1987; Fogel , 2004; Komlos , 2009; Martins et al . , 2014; Martorell , 1995 ) . Our results on the large gains in continental European countries , and that they have overtaken English-speaking countries like the USA , are consistent with these earlier studies although these earlier analyses covered fewer countries in Eastern and Southern Europe , and used some self-reported data with simple adjustments that cannot fully correct for their bias ( Hatton and Bray , 2010; Facchini and Gualdi-Russo , 1982; Baten and Blum , 2012 ) . Less has been known about trends in women’s height , and those in non-English-speaking/non-European parts of the world . We found that some of the most important changes in height have happened in these under-investigated populations . In particular , South Korean and Japanese men and women , and Iranian men , have had larger gains than European men , and similar trends are now happening in China and Thailand . These gains may partially account for the fact that women in Japan and South Korea have achieved the first and fourth highest life expectancy in the world ( see also below ) . In contrast to East Asia’s impressive gains , the rise in height seems to have stopped early in South Asia and reversed in Africa , reversing or diminishing Africa’s earlier advantage over Asia . Prior studies have documented a rise in stunting in children in sub-Saharan Africa which continued to the mid-1990s ( Stevens et al . , 2012 ) . Our results indicate that such childhood adversity may have carried forward to adulthood and be affecting health in the region . The early African advantage over Asia may also have been partly due to having a more diverse diet compared to the vegetable and cereal diet in Asia , partly facilitated by lower population density ( Deaton , 2007; Moradi , 2010 ) . Rising population , coupled with worsening economic status during structural adjustment , may have undermined earlier dietary advantage ( Stevens et al . , 2012; Pongou et al . , 2006; Weil et al . , 1990; Sundberg , 2009 ) . The main strengths of our study are its novel scope of estimating a century of trends in adult height for all countries in the world and for both sexes . Our population-based results complement the individual-level studies on the genetic and environmental determinants of within-population variation in height , and will help develop and test hypotheses about the determinants of adult height , and its health consequences . We achieved this by using a large number of population-based data sources from all regions of the world . We put particular emphasis on data quality and used only population-based data that had measured height , which avoids bias in self-reported height . Data were analysed according to a common protocol before being pooled , and characteristics and quality of data sources were verified through repeated checks by Collaborating Group members . Finally , we pooled data using a statistical model that could characterize non-linear trends and that used all available data while giving more weight to national data than to subnational and community surveys . Although we have gathered an unprecedentedly comprehensive database of human height and growth , and have applied a statistical model that maximally utilizes the information in these sources , data in some countries were rather limited or were from community or sub-national studies . This is reflected in larger uncertainty of the estimated height in these countries . To overcome this , surveillance of growth , which has focused largely on children , should also systematically monitor adolescents and adults given the increasingly abundant evidence on their effects on adult health and human capital . Even measured height data can be subject to measurement error depending on how closely study protocols are followed . Finally , we did not have separate data on leg and trunk lengths , which may differ in their determinants , especially in relation to age at menarche and pre- vs . post-pubertal growth and nutrition , and health effects ( Tanner et al . , 1982; Frisch and Revelle , 1971 ) . Greater height in adulthood is both beneficially ( cardiovascular and respiratory diseases ) and harmfully ( colorectal , postmenopausal breast and ovarian cancers , and possibly pancreatic , prostate and premenopausal breast cancers ) associated with several diseases , independently of its inverse correlation with BMI ( Paajanen et al . , 2010; Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration , 2012; Green et al . , 2011; Nelson et al . , 2015; Batty et al . , 2010; World Cancer Research Fund / American Institute for Cancer Research , 2007; 2010; 2011; 2012; 2014a; 2014b; Nüesch et al . , 2015; Davies et al . , 2015; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) . If the associations in epidemiological studies are causal , which is supported by the more recent evidence from Mendelian randomisation studies ( Green et al . , 2011; Nüesch et al . , 2015; Davies et al . , 2015; Zhang et al . , 2015 ) , the ~20 cm height range in the world is associated with a 17% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality and 20–40% higher risk of various site-specific cancers , in tall versus short countries . Consistent with individual-level evidence on the association between taller height and lower all-cause mortality in adult ages ( Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration , 2012 ) , gains in mean population height in successive cohorts are associated with lower mortality in middle and older ages in countries with reliable mortality data ( correlation coefficient = −0 . 58 for men and −0 . 68 for women ) ( Figure 11 ) , demonstrating the large impacts of height gain on population health and longevity . Further , short maternal stature increases the risk of small-for-gestational-age and preterm births , both risk factors for neonatal mortality , and of pregnancy complications ( Kozuki et al . , 2015; Black et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , improvements vs . stagnation in women’s height can influence trends in infant and maternal mortality . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 013Figure 11 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13410 . 013 Our study also shows the potential for using height in early adulthood as an indicator that integrates across different dimensions of sustainable human development . Adult height signifies not only foetal and early childhood nutrition , which was included in the Millennium Development Goals , but also that of adolescents ( Lancet , 2014 ) . Further , adult height is a link between these early-life experiences and NCDs , longevity , education and earnings . It can easily be measured in health surveys and can be used to investigate differences across countries and trends over time , as done in our work , as well as within-country inequalities . Therefore , height in early adulthood , which varies substantially across countries and over time , provides a measurable indicator for sustainable development , with links to health and longevity , nutrition , education and economic productivity . 
 We estimated trends in mean height for adults born from 1896 to 1996 ( i . e . , people who had reached their 18th birthday from 1914 to 2014 ) in 200 countries and territories . Countries were organized into 20 regions , mostly based on a combination of geography and national income ( Supplementary file 1 ) . Our study had two steps , described below . First , we identified , accessed , and re-analysed population-based measurement studies of human anthropometry . We then used a statistical model to estimate trends for all countries and territories . We used data sources that were representative of a national , subnational , or community population and had measured height . We did not use self-reported height because it is subject to systematic bias that varies by geography , time , age , sex , and socioeconomic characteristics like education and ethnicity ( Engstrom et al . , 2003; Connor Gorber et al . , 2007; Wetmore and Mokdad , 2012; Schenker et al . , 2010; Ezzati et al . , 2006; Clarke et al . , 2014; Hayes et al . , 2011 ) . Data sources were included in the NCD-RisC database if: We excluded data sources on population subgroups whose anthropometric status may differ systematically from the general population , including: We used school-based data in countries where secondary school enrolment was 70% or higher , and used data whose sampling frame was health insurance schemes in countries where at least 80% of the population were insured . We used data collected through general practice and primary care clinics in high-income countries with universal insurance , because contact with the primary care systems tends to be at least as good as response rates for population-based surveys . No studies were excluded based on the level of height . We used multiple routes for identifying and accessing data . We accessed publicly available population-based multi-country and national measurement surveys ( e . g . , Demographic and Health Surveys , and surveys identified via the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research and European Health Interview & Health Examination Surveys Database ) as well as the World Health Organization ( WHO ) STEPwise approach to Surveillance ( STEPS ) surveys . We requested identification and access to population-based data sources from ministries of health and other national health agencies , via WHO and its regional offices . Requests were also sent via the World Heart Federation to its national partners . We made a similar request to the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration ( NCD-RisC; www . ncdrisc . org ) , a worldwide network of health researchers and practitioners working on NCD risk factors . To identify major sources not accessed through the above routes , we searched and reviewed published studies . Specifically , we searched Medline ( via PubMed ) for articles published between 1st January 1950 and 12th March 2013 using the search terms 'body size'[mh:noexp] OR 'body height'[mh:noexp] OR 'body weight'[mh:noexp] OR 'birth weight'[mh:noexp] OR 'overweight'[mh:noexp] OR 'obesity'[mh] OR 'thinness'[mh:noexp] OR 'Waist-Hip Ratio'[mh:noexp] or 'Waist Circumference'[mh:noexp] or 'body mass index' [mh:noexp] ) AND ( 'Humans'[mh] ) AND ( '1950'[PDAT]: '2013'[PDAT] ) AND ( 'Health Surveys'[mh] OR 'Epidemiological Monitoring'[mh] OR 'Prevalence'[mh] ) NOT Comment[ptyp] NOT Case Reports[ptyp] . Articles were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria described above . The number of articles identified and retained is summarised in Supplementary file 2 . As described above , we contacted the corresponding authors of all eligible studies and invited them to join NCD-RisC . We did similar searches for other cardio-metabolic risk factors including blood pressure , serum cholesterol , and blood glucose . All eligible studies were invited to join NCD-RisC and were requested to analyse data on all cardio-metabolic risk factors . Anonymised individual record data from sources included in NCD-RisC were re-analysed by the Pooled Analysis and Writing Group or by data holders according to a common protocol . All re-analysed data sources included mean height in standard age groups ( 18 years , 19 years , 20–29 years , followed by 10 year age groups and 80+ years ) , as well as sample sizes and standard errors . All analyses incorporated appropriate sample weights and complex survey design when applicable . To ensure summaries were prepared according to the study protocol , the Pooled Analysis and Writing Group provided computer code to NCD-RisC members who requested assistance . We also recorded information about the study population , period of measurement and sampling approach . This information was used to establish that each data source was population-based , and to assess whether it covered the whole country , multiple subnational regions , or one or a small number of communities , and whether it was rural , urban , or combined . All submitted data were checked by at least two independent members of the Pooled Analysis and Writing Group to ensure that their sample selection met the inclusion criteria and that height was measured and not self-reported . Questions and clarifications about sample design and measurement method were discussed with the Collaborating Group members and resolved before data were incorporated in the database . We also extracted data from additional national health surveys , one subnational STEPS survey , and six MONICA sites from published reports . We identified duplicate data sources by comparing studies from the same country and year . Additionally , NCD-RisC members received the list of all data sources in the database and were asked to ensure that the included data from their country met the inclusion criteria and that there were no duplicates . Data sources used in our analysis are listed in Supplementary file 3 . In this paper , we used data on height in adulthood ( 18 years of age and older ) from the NCD-RisC database for participants born between 1896 and 1996 . We used 1472 population-based data sources with measurements on over 18 . 6 million adults born between 1896 and 1996 whose height had been measured . We did not use data from the 1860–1895 cohorts because data on these early cohorts were available for only six countries ( American Samoa , India , Japan , Norway , Switzerland and USA ) . We had data for 179 of the 200 countries for which estimates were made; these 179 countries covered 97% of the world’s population . All countries had some data on people born after 1946 ( second half of analysis period ) ; 134 had data on people born between 1921 and 1945; and 72 had data on people born in 1920 or earlier . Across regions , there were between an average of 2 . 0 data sources per country in the Caribbean to 34 sources per country in high-income Asia Pacific . 1108 sources had data on men as well as women , 153 only on men , and 211 only on women . The statistical method is described in detail elsewhere ( Danaei et al . , 2011; Finucane et al . , 2014 ) . In summary , the model had a hierarchical structure in which estimates of mean height for each country and year were nested in regional levels and trends , which were in turn nested in those of super-regions and worldwide . In this structure , estimates of mean height for each country and year were informed by its own data , if available , and by data from other years in the same country and in other countries , especially those in the same region with data for similar time periods . The hierarchical structure shares information to a greater degree when data are non-existent or weakly informative ( e . g . , because they have a small sample size ) , and to a lesser extent in data-rich countries and regions . We used birth cohort as the time scale of analysis . We calculated the birth cohort for each observation by subtracting the mid-age of its age group from the year in which data were collected . We modelled trends in height by birth cohort as a combination of linear and non-linear trends , both with a hierarchical structure; the non-linear trend was specified using a second-order random walk ( Rue and Held , 2005 ) . The model also included a term that allowed each birth cohort’s height to change as it aged , e . g . , because there is gradual loss of height during ageing and because as a cohort ages those who survive may be taller . The model described by Finucane et al ( Finucane et al . , 2014 ) had used a cubic spline for age associations of risk factor levels . In practice , the estimated change in population mean height over age was linear with a small slope of over 0 . 2 cm shorter for men and 0 . 3 cm shorter for women with each decade of older age . Therefore , we used a linear specification for computational efficiency . While all our data were from samples of the general population , 796 ( 54% ) of data sources represented national populations , another 199 ( 14% ) major sub-national regions ( e . g . , one or more provinces or regions of a country ) , and the remaining 477 ( 32% ) one or a small number of communities . The model accounted for the fact that sub-national and community studies , while informative , might systematically differ from nationally representative ones , and also have larger variation relative to the true values than national studies ( e . g . , see data from China , India , Japan and the UK in Figure 6 and Figure 7 ) . We fitted the Bayesian model with the Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) algorithm . We monitored mixing and convergence using trace plots and Brooks–Gelman–Rubin diagnostics ( Brooks and Gelman , 1998 ) . We obtained 5000 post burn-in samples from the posterior distribution of model parameters , used to obtain the posterior distribution of mean height . The reported credible intervals represent the 2 . 5th–97 . 5th percentiles of the posterior distribution . We report mean height at age 18 years for each birth cohort; heights at other ages are available from the authors . All analyses were done separately by sex because height and its trends over time may differ between men and women . We tested how well our statistical model predicts missing values by removing data from 10% of countries with data ( i . e . , created the appearance of countries with no data where we actually had data ) . The countries whose data were withheld were randomly selected from the following three groups: data-rich ( more than 25 cohorts of data , with at least five cohorts after 1960 ) , data-poor ( up to and including 12 cohorts of data for women and 8 cohorts for men ) , and average data availability ( 13 to 25 cohorts for women , 9 to 25 cohorts for men , or more than 25 cohorts in total with fewer than five after 1960 ) . In total , there were 64 data-rich countries for women and 51 for men; 57 data-poor countries for women and 58 for men; and 56 countries for women and 60 for men that had average data availability . We fitted the model to the data from the remaining 90% of countries and made estimates of the held-out observations . We repeated the test five times , holding out a different subset of data in each repetition . We calculated the differences between the held-out data and the estimates . We also checked the 95% credible intervals of the estimates; in a model with good external predictive validity , 95% of held-out values would be included in the 95% credible intervals . Our model performed extremely well; specifically , the estimates of mean height were unbiased as evidenced with median errors that were very close to zero globally , and less than ±0 . 2 cm in every subset of withheld data ( Supplementary file 4 ) . Even the 25th and 75th percentiles of errors rarely exceeded ±1 cm . Median absolute error was only about 0 . 5 cm , and did not exceed 1 . 0 cm in subsets of withheld data . The 95% credible intervals of estimated mean heights covered 97% of true data for both men and women , which implies good estimation of uncertainty; among subgroups of data , coverage was never < 90% .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials\xa0and\xa0methods']",['epidemiology and global health'],elife-13410-v2,182,6712,6530,36.879120879120876

However , taken in too high a dose they can depress breathing – in other words , they can lead to slow , shallow breaths that cannot sustain life . In the United States , where the misuse of these drugs has been soaring in the past decades , about 130 people die each day from opioid overdose . Pinpointing the exact brain areas and neurons that opioids act on to depress breathing could help to create safer painkillers that do not have this deadly effect . While previous studies have proposed several brain regions that could be involved , they have not been able to confirm these results , or determine which area plays the biggest role . Opioids influence the brain of animals ( including humans ) by attaching to proteins known as opioid receptors that are present at the surface of neurons . Here , Bachmutsky et al . genetically engineered mice that lack these receptors in specific brain regions that control breathing . The animals were then exposed to opioids , and their breathing was closely monitored . The experiments showed that two small brain areas were responsible for breathing becoming depressed under the influence of opioids . The region with the most critical impact also happens to be where the breathing rhythms originate . There , a small group of 50 to 140 neurons were used by opioids to depress breathing . Crucially , these cells were not necessary for the drugs’ ability to relieve pain . Overall , the work by Bachmutsky et al . highlights a group of neurons whose role in creating breathing rhythms deserves further attention . It also opens the possibility that targeting these neurons would help to create safer painkillers .","The rates of opioid overdose in the United States quadrupled between 1999 and 2017 , reaching a staggering 130 deaths per day . This health epidemic demands innovative solutions that require uncovering the key brain areas and cell types mediating the cause of overdose— opioid-induced respiratory depression . Here , we identify two primary changes to murine breathing after administering opioids . These changes implicate the brainstem’s breathing circuitry which we confirm by locally eliminating the µ-Opioid receptor . We find the critical brain site is the preBötzinger Complex , where the breathing rhythm originates , and use genetic tools to reveal that just 70–140 neurons in this region are responsible for its sensitivity to opioids . Future characterization of these neurons may lead to novel therapies that prevent respiratory depression while sparing analgesia . 
 Nearly 400 , 000 people in the United States died from a drug overdose involving a prescription or illicit opioid between 1999 and 2017 ( Scholl et al . , 2018 ) . This epidemic is not unique to the United States and with the increasing distribution of highly potent synthetic opioids like fentanyl , it has become a global public health emergency ( Rudd et al . , 2016 ) . Death from opioid overdose results from slow and shallow breathing , also known as opioid induced respiratory depression ( OIRD , Pattinson , 2008 ) . Like humans , breathing in mice is severely depressed by opioids and this response is eliminated when the µ-Opioid receptor ( Oprm1 ) is globally deleted ( Dahan et al . , 2001 ) . Oprm1 is broadly expressed , in both the central and peripheral nervous systems , including sites that could modulate breathing such as: the cerebral cortex , brainstem respiratory control centers , primary motor neurons , solitary nucleus , and oxygen sensing afferents ( Mansour et al . , 1994; Kirby and McQueen , 1986 ) . Therefore , either one or multiple sites could be mediating the depressive effects of opioids on breathing . Indeed , multiple brain regions have been shown to independently slow breathing after local injection of opioid agonists ( Kirby and McQueen , 1986; Montandon et al . , 2011; Mustapic et al . , 2010; Prkic et al . , 2012 ) . Although informative , doubts remain for which of these sites are necessary and sufficient to induce OIRD from systemic opioids for three reasons . First , injection of opioid agonists or antagonists into candidate areas modulates µ-opioid receptors on the cell body ( post-synaptic ) as well as receptors on incoming terminals ( pre-synaptic ) . Second , these studies necessitate anesthetized and reduced animal preparations , which alter brain activity in many of the candidate Oprm1 expressing sites . And third , there is not a standard and quantitative definition for how breathing changes in OIRD , and this makes comparing studies that use different breathing metrics measured in different experimental paradigms challenging . To address these limitations , we conducted a detailed quantitative analysis of OIRD in awake animals and identify two key changes to the breath that drive the depressive effects of opioids . These two metrics thereafter define OIRD in our study and can serve as a rubric for others . We then locally eliminate the µ-opioid receptor in awake mice , disambiguating pre and post-synaptic effects , and use these metrics to define two key brain sites that mediate OIRD . Recently , a similar approach demonstrated some role for these sites in OIRD ( Varga et al . , 2020 ) . Among these two sites in our study , we find that one is dominant and driven by just 140 critical neurons in vitro and , importantly , these neurons are not required for opioid-induced analgesia , suggesting a neutral target for developing safer opioids or rescue strategies for opioid overdose . 
 Up to now , OIRD has generally been described as a slowing and shallowing of breath ( Pattinson , 2008 ) . We therefore felt it was important to more precisely , quantitatively describe the changes in breathing in hopes of elucidating potential mechanisms of respiratory depression . We began by asking whether specific parameters of the breath are affected by opioids . We monitored breathing in awake , behaving mice by whole body plethysmography after intraperitoneal injection ( IP ) of saline for control and then 20 mg/kg morphine at least 24 hr later ( Figure 1A ) . Compared to saline , breathing after morphine administration ( in normoxia ) became much slower and inspiratory airflow decreased , each by 60% ( Figure 1B , C ) . This culminated in ~50% decrease in overall minute ventilation ( MV = approximated tidal volume x respiratory rate , Figure 1C ) , demonstrating that 20 mg/kg morphine is , indeed , a suitable dose to model OIRD . Breath morphology in normoxia after IP saline versus morphine cannot be directly compared since activity of the mouse is different ( exploring vs . sedated , Supplementary file 1 ) , which significantly influences the types of breaths taken . This prevented a precise characterization of breath parameters that dictate OIRD . To overcome this , we measured breathing in hypercapnic air ( 21% O2 , 5% CO2 ) which normalizes behavior and thus breathing ( Figure 1D , Supplementary file 1 ) . As in normoxia , morphine depressed respiratory rate ( by 50% , Figure 1E , F ) , peak inspiratory airflow ( by 60% , Figure 1E , F ) , and minute ventilation ( by 60% , Figure 1F ) . Hypercapnic breaths after saline exhibited two phases , inspiration and expiration , each lasting about 50 msec . ( Figure 1G , H ) . After morphine , only the inspiratory phase ( measured as inspiratory time , Ti ) became substantially longer ( Figure 1G , H ) . Additionally , hypercapnic breaths showed a new , third phase after the initial expiration ( measured as expiratory time , Te , Figure 1G , H ) that was characterized by prolonged little to no airflow ( <0 . 5 mL/sec . ) preceding hypercapnia induced active expiration ( Pisanski and Pagliardini , 2019 ) . We define this new phase as a pause ( low airflow + active expiration , Figure 1G , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Such pauses lasted up to several hundred milliseconds ( Figure 1I ) , accounting for about one-third of the average breath length ( Figure 1J ) . Thus , the 50% decrease in respiratory rate after morphine administration is primarily due to prolonging of Ti and pause phases , and the increased prevalence of time spent in pause significantly contributes to the decrease in minute ventilation . Typically the length of inspiratory time is determined by a stretch-evoked feedback signal from the lung which terminates inspiration ( West , 2005 ) . This reflex is represented by the correlation observed between Ti and peak inspiratory airflow ( Figure 1K ) . Breaths in morphine still maintain this correlation despite having a longer Ti and decreased inspiratory airflow ( Figure 1K ) . As a result , morphine breaths have a similar approximated tidal volume ( TV ) compared to saline control ( Figure 1L , M ) . In other words , as opioids decrease inspiratory airflow , Ti displays a compensatory increase to preserve TV ( Figures 1N and Hill et al . , 2018 ) . In summary , opioids cause only two primary changes to the breath , namely , 1 ) decreased inspiratory airflow and 2 ) addition of a pause phase that delays initiation of subsequent breaths ( Figure 1N ) . These two parameters can both be controlled by the breathing central pattern generator , the preBötzinger Complex ( preBötC ) , in the brainstem and suggest that this may be a key locus affected during OIRD ( Smith et al . , 1991; Feldman et al . , 2013; Cui et al . , 2016 ) . Indeed , the preBötC has been proposed to play a key role in OIRD since localized injection of opioids results in respiratory depression and localized naloxone reverses decreased breathing after administration of systemic opioids ( Montandon et al . , 2011; Montandon and Horner , 2014 ) . However , such experiments fail to distinguish between the action of opioids on presynaptic terminals ( Mudge et al . , 1979 ) of distant neurons projecting into the preBötC versus direct action on preBötC neurons themselves ( Figure 2A; Montandon et al . , 2011; Dobbins and Feldman , 1994; Gray et al . , 1999 ) To overcome this , we genetically eliminated the µ-Opioid receptor ( Oprm1 ) from preBötC cells exclusively , sparing projecting inputs , by stereotaxic injection of adeno-associated virus constitutively expressing Cre ( AAV-Cre-GFP ) into the preBötC of Oprm1 flox/flox ( Oprm1f/f ) adult mice ( Figure 2B ) . Injection site specificity was confirmed by the restricted expression of Cre-GFP ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , and subsequent Oprm1 deletion , was inferred . To establish a baseline , we first measured breathing after administration of saline and morphine in normoxia and hypercapnia in intact animals , as described above . At least one month after bilateral injection of virus into the preBötC , we then re-analyzed breathing ( Figure 2C ) . With this protocol , each animal’s unique breathing and OIRD response serves as its own internal control , which is necessary due to the variability in OIRD severity between mice ( Figure 1F ) . Deletion of Oprm1 in the preBötC did not affect breathing observed after saline injection ( Figure 2D , E ) , suggesting that in this context , opioids do not exert an endogenous effect . In contrast , breathing was markedly less depressed by morphine administration ( Figure 2D , E ) compared to the intact control state: breaths were twice as fast ( 3 to 6 Hz , Figure 2F , H ) , the peak inspiratory flow was larger ( Figure 2F , I ) , and pauses were nearly eliminated ( Figure 2G , J ) . Notably , histological analysis confirmed that AAV-Cre-GFP expression was localized to the preBötC ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) , and AAV-GFP or tdTomato injected control mice without removal of Oprm1 showed no change in OIRD compared to the pre-injected control state ( Figure 2H–J ) , demonstrating that animals do not develop tolerance to opioids within our experimental timeline . Importantly , rescue of OIRD similarly occurred in normoxia ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) and was also specific to breathing since opioids induced analgesia in tail-flick assay after deletion of Oprm1 in the preBötC ( Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . Although key features of OIRD ( inspiratory airflow and pause ) were attenuated by preBötC AAV-Cre injection , rescue was incomplete . This could be explained by incomplete Oprm1 deletion within the preBötC , or participation of another brain site in OIRD . Injection of opioids into the parabrachial ( PBN ) /Kolliker-Fuse ( KF ) nucleus can also slow breathing , making it a candidate second site ( Mustapic et al . , 2010; Prkic et al . , 2012 ) . In fact , the PBN/KF has been proposed to be the key site mediating OIRD ( Eguchi et al . , 1987; Lalley et al . , 2014 ) . We therefore took a similar approach to test the role of the PBN/KF in OIRD ( Figure 3A ) . AAV-Cre injection into the PBN/KF ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) produced a slight increase in the morphine-evoked respiratory rate ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 , Figure 3D , E ) and inspiratory airflow ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 , Figure 3F , G ) , but had a more moderate effect than injection into the preBötC . To determine if the preBötC and PBN/KF can completely account for OIRD ( Figure 3A ) , we genetically deleted Oprm1 from the preBötC and then from the PBN/KF ( Cohort 1 ) or vice versa ( Cohort 2 , Figure 3B ) . In either cohort , double deletion breathing after morphine administration looked nearly identical to that of saline control animals ( Figure 3C ) , with breathing rate and inspiratory airflow depressed by only ~20% compared to saline ( Figure 3D–G ) . Moreover , changes in breathing after viral injection at the second site appeared additive ( Figure 3D–G ) and equivalent to individual preBötC ( Figure 2 ) or PBN/KF ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 , Figure 3D–G ) effects for each cognate cohort . The double deletion OIRD rescue was similar in normoxia ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . To our surprise , rescues also occurred in animals which happened to have mostly unilateral PBN/KF AAV-cre transduction ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ) , therefore these animals were still included in our double deletion analysis ( Figure 3E , G ) . Breathing in double-deleted animals was even resilient to super-saturating doses of opioid that severely slow breathing in control animals ( 150 mg/kg fentanyl , Figure 3H , I ) . Taken together , our data are consistent with a model in which both the preBötC and PBN/KF contribute to opioid respiratory depression , with the former being predominant , and together account for OIRD . Given the relative importance of the preBötC to OIRD , we sought to identify which Oprm1 expressing cells within this region depress breathing . Single cell transcriptome profiling of the ventral lateral brainstem of P0 mice ( Figure 4A ) showed that Oprm1 ( mRNA ) is expressed almost exclusively by neurons ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) and is remarkably restricted to just 8% of presumed preBötC neurons ( Figure 4B ) . This alone is interesting , as it suggests that modulation of only a small subset of neurons with the preBötC is enough to significantly impact its ability to generate a rhythm . We also determined that within the preBötC , Oprm1 ( mRNA ) was expressed by glycinergic ( Slc6a5 expressing ) , gabaergic ( Gad2/Slc32a1 expressing ) , and glutamatergic ( Slc17a6 expressing ) neural types alike ( Figure 4C ) and therefore Oprm1 ( mRNA ) expression is not exclusive to any known rhythmogenic preBötC subpopulation . Slices containing the preBötC autonomously generate respiratory-like rhythmic activity in vitro which is depressed in both rate and amplitude by bath administration of opioid agonists ( Gray et al . , 1999; Lorier et al . , 2010 ) , similar to opioid effects we observed on breathing in vivo . To determine which neural class mediates the depression of preBötC activity , we measured rhythmic bursting activity in vitro ( Figure 4D ) after selectively genetically deleting Oprm1 from each neural class . We achieved this deletion by crossing Oprm1f/f mice with each of the following: Slc17a6-Cre , Slc32a1-Cre , Gad2-Cre , or Slc6a5-Cre transgenic animals . preBötC slices from control mice ( Oprm1f/f , Oprm1f/+ , or Oprm1+/+ ) burst every 5–10 s and this activity was eliminated in 100% of slices by bath application of the selective µ-Opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2 , NMe-Phe4 , Gly-ol5]-enkephalin ( DAMGO , 50 nM ) , and subsequently rescued by opioid antagonist naloxone ( Figure 4E , F ) . Strikingly , the bursting rhythm of Slc17a6-Cre;Oprm1f/f slices was not slowed by DAMGO , whereas the rhythm in Gad2- , Slc32a1- , and Slc6a5-Cre; Oprm1f/f slices was entirely eliminated , akin to wild type controls ( Figure 4E , F , Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . This demonstrates that glutamatergic excitatory neurons , representing ~50% of all preBötC Oprm1-expressing neurons and therefore 4% of preBötC neurons , mediate OIRD in vitro . Next , we dissected the glutamatergic Oprm1 preBötC neurons by two developmental transcription factors , Dbx1 or Foxp2 ( Gray et al . , 2010; Bouvier et al . , 2010; Gray , 2013 ) , to determine if a subset can rescue rhythm depression ( Figure 4G ) . Triple-labeling of Dbx1-YFP , OPRM1 fused to mCherry ( OPRM1-mCherry ) , and FOXP2 protein quantified within a single preBötC revealed three molecular subtypes of P0 Oprm1 glutamatergic neurons: 92 ± 9 Dbx1 , 50 ± 2 Dbx1/FOXP2 , and 20 ± 4 FOXP2 ( Figure 4H , I ) . We selectively eliminated the µ-Opioid receptor in these two lineages ( Dbx1-Cre;Oprm1f/f or Foxp2-Cre;Oprm1f/f ) and measured preBötC slice activity at increasing concentrations of DAMGO , exceeding the dose necessary to silence the control rhythm ( 500 nM vs . 50 nM ) . Elimination of Oprm1 from both genotypes was sufficient to rescue the frequency and amplitude of preBötC bursting in DAMGO , and the Dbx1 rescue was comparable to elimination of Oprm1 from all glutamatergic neurons , while the Foxp2 rescue was substantial , but partial ( ~50–60% , Figure 4J ) . This shows that opioids silence a small cohort ( ~140 ) of glutamatergic neurons to depress preBötC activity , and that a molecularly defined subpopulation , about half , can be targeted to rescue these effects . 
 We find that although multiple breathing parameters are impacted by opioids , decreased inspiratory airflow and delayed breath initiation , which we term pause , represent the primary changes that result in OIRD . Pauses occur during expiration and account for tens to hundreds of milliseconds of low airflow per breath . In hypercapnia , these pause periods terminate with an active expiration . The force , timing of inspiration , and expression of active expiration are ultimately determined by the inspiratory rhythm generator , the preBötC , and focused our initial studies to this site ( Smith et al . , 1991; Feldman et al . , 2013; Cui et al . , 2016; Huckstepp et al . , 2016 ) . Additionally , correlates of these two changes manifest as decreased burst size and frequency in the activity of the preBötC slice in vitro . These two key changes in the breath can guide future OIRD studies and efforts to characterize and test novel opioid drugs . Additionally , this workflow can be applied to the analysis of other respiratory depressants . Our experimental design allowed us to determine that both the preBötC and PBN/KF have independent and additive rescue of OIRD . Of these two , the preBötC has the larger magnitude rescue of our two core breathing parameters . The combined deletion of µ-Opioid receptor from both sites essentially eliminates OIRD , even to extremely high doses of the potent opioid fentanyl . This suggests that targeting just these two sites is sufficient to rescue opioid respiratory depression . We interpret the small remaining effect of opioids we observe to be due to incomplete transduction of these brain areas but cannot rule out other minor contributing sites . It is also possible , given the challenge of restricting viral transduction , that some of the demonstrated effects are already due to spillover deletion of µ-Opioid receptor in neighboring brain areas , such as the bulbospinal rostral ventral respiratory group . Our studies were limited to two opioids ( morphine and fentanyl ) at a specific dose and it will be important in future work to determine if these two brain sites are also critical for OIRD caused by these opioids at different doses or other opioids altogether . The two hallmark changes during OIRD , decreased inspiratory airflow and delayed initiation , perfectly match the opioid induced depression of amplitude and frequency in the preBötC slice . We show that ~140 Oprm1 glutamatergic preBötC neurons mediate this effect . And surprisingly , half this number , just ~70 glutamatergic neurons are sufficient to rescue opioid depression of the preBötC rhythm ( 50 Dbx1/FOXP2 and 20 FOXP2 in Foxp2-Cre;Oprm1f/f , Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . Further , given the importance of Dbx1 neurons in respiratory rhythm generation ( Gray et al . , 2010; Bouvier et al . , 2010 ) , rescuing Oprm1 in just ~50/140 Dbx1 neurons ( the Foxp2+ subset ) may be sufficient to prevent preBötC depression , the smallest number of neurons we propose . This small number is remarkably consistent with the number of Dbx1 neurons that must be lesioned to arrest preBötC activity ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) . Given the similarity of these effects , we hypothesize that opioids are primarily acting by silencing presynaptic release , effectively removing these neurons from the network . Alternatively , it is proposed that just a small subset of preBötC excitatory neurons may generate the inspiratory rhythm ( Phillips et al . , 2019 ) and perhaps these key Oprm1 neurons are enriched within this subgroup . In this instance , since hyperpolarization of preBötC rhythmogenic neurons slows and silences breathing ( Koizumi et al . , 2016 ) , opioids may act postsynaptically as proposed by others ( Montandon et al . , 2011; Johnson et al . , 1996 ) . Regardless , it is profound that such a small number can abruptly halt the respiratory rhythm in a network of more than 1000 neurons and suggests that either these neurons act as a key population for rhythmogenesis , or that recurrent excitatory networks are exquisitely sensitive to the number of participating cells . Important future work will need to use the Dbx1/Oprm1 and Foxp2/Oprm1 molecular codes to selectively eliminate Oprm1 from these neurons to test if truly so few neurons profoundly control or modulate breathing in vivo . 
 Oprm1f/f ( Weibel et al . , 2013 ) , Oprm1-mCherry ( Erbs et al . , 2015 ) , Slc17a6-Cre ( Vong et al . , 2011 ) , Gad2-Cre ( Taniguchi et al . , 2011 ) , Slc32a1-Cre ( Vong et al . , 2011 ) , Slc6a5-Cre ( Sherman et al . , 2015 ) , Dbx1-Cre ( Bielle et al . , 2005 ) , Foxp2-Cre ( Rousso et al . , 2016 ) , Rosa-LSL-YFP ( Madisen et al . , 2010 ) have been described . Littermates of transgene-containing mice were used as wild type controls . C57Bl/6 mice were used for single cell mRNA sequencing . Mice were housed in a 12 hr light/dark cycle with unrestricted food and water . Oprm1f/f mice were assigned into experimental and control groups at weaning and given anonymized identities for experimentation and data collection . All animal experiments were performed in accordance with national and institutional guidelines with standard precautions to minimize animal stress and the number of animals used in each experiment . All viral procedures followed the Biosafety Guidelines approved by the University of California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) Institutional Animal Care and Use Program ( IACUC ) and Institutional Biosafety Committee ( IBC ) . The following viruses were used: AAV5-CMV-Cre-GFP ( 4 . 7 × 1019 particles/mL , The Vector Core at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ) , AAV5-CAG-GFP ( 1 . 0 × 1013 particles/mL , The Vector Core at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ) or AAV5-CAG-tdtomato ( 4 . 3 × 1012 particles/mL , The Vector Core at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill ) . Postnatal day 0–4 brains were dissected in cold PBS , and adult brains were perfused with cold PBS and then 4% paraformaldehyde by intracardiac perfusion . The isolated brains from neonates and adults were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C and dehydrated in 30% sucrose the next 24 hr at 4°C . Brains were embedded and frozen in OCT once equilibrated in 30% sucrose . Cryosections ( 18–25 μM ) were washed twice for 5 min in 0 . 1% Tween-20 in PBS , once for 10 min in 0 . 3% Triton-X100 in PBS , and then twice for 5 min in 0 . 1% Tween-20 in PBS . Following wash , sections were blocked for 20 min with either 10% goat serum in 0 . 3% Trition-X100 PBS . Sections were then incubated overnight at 4°C in the appropriate block solution containing primary antibody . Primary antibodies used were: rabbit anti-SST ( Peninsula T-4103 , 1:500 ) , rabbit anti-FOXP2 ( Abcam ab16046 , 1:500 ) , chicken anti-GFP ( Abcam ab13970 , 1:500 ) , rat anti-mCherry ( Lifetech . M11217 , 1:500 ) . After primary incubation , sections were washed three times for 10 min in 0 . 1% Tween-20 in PBS , then incubated for 1 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C in block containing secondary antibody . Secondary antibodies were: goat anti-rat 555 ( Lifetech A21434 , 1:200 ) , goat anti-chicken 488 ( Lifetech A11039 , 1:200 ) , goat anti-rabbit 633 ( Lifetech 35562 , 1:200 ) . After secondary incubation , sections were washed in 0 . 1% Tween-20 in PBS and mounted in Mowiol with DAPI mounting media to prevent photobleaching . Adult ( 8–20 weeks ) Oprm1f/f mice were first administered either IP 100–200 µL of saline or morphine ( 20 mg/kg , Henry Schein 057202 ) and placed in an isolated recovery cage for 15 min to allow full onset of action of the drug . Individual mice were then monitored in a 450 mL whole animal plethysmography chamber at room temperature ( 22°C ) in 21% O2 balanced with N2 ( normoxia ) or 21% O2 , 5% CO2 balanced with N2 ( hypercapnia ) . For fentanyl ( 150 mg/kg , Sigma F3886 ) onset of action was so fast ( <10 s ) that animals were placed directly in the plethysmography chamber after administration of drug . Each session ( combination of drug and oxygen condition ) was separated by at least 24 hr to allow full recovery . Breathing was monitored by plethysmography , and other activity in the chamber monitored by video recording , for 40 min periods in normoxia and 10 min periods in hypercapnia . In cases where mice were subject to single or double site AAV injection to delete Oprm1 or sham controls , breathing was recorded first before viral injection and then again after deletion ( or sham ) more than 4 weeks later . Breathing traces were collected using EMKA iOX2 software and exported to Matlab for analysis . Each breath was automatically segmented based on airflow crossing zero as well as quality control metrics . Respiratory parameters ( e . g . peak inspiratory flow , instantaneous frequency , pause length , tidal volume , etc ) for each breath , as well as averages across states , were then calculated . Instantaneous frequency was defined as the inverse of breath duration . Pause length was defined as the expiratory period after airflow dropped below 0 . 5 mL/sec . The pause period is initially a prolonged airflow around or just above 0 mL/sec . and terminates with an increase in expiratory airflow , likely the active expiration induced by hypercapnia ( 11 , Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . The 0 . 5 mL/sec . threshold was chosen since it identifies low airflow pauses that are just above 0 mL/sec . which rarely occur in control hypercapnic breaths ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Although pauses in length 50-100msec . could be considered false positives because they do not have a considerable low airflow period ( see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and , panel 2 ) , they occur at a low rate in saline ( 1 . 53% ) and we see an increased distribution of pauses in morphine that last hundreds of milliseconds ( Figure 1I , see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and , panel 3 and 4 ) . Other respiratory parameters were defined by when airflow crosses the value of 0 , with positive to negative being inspiration onset and negative to positive being expiration onset . Note , reported airflow in mL/sec . and tidal volume in mL are approximates of the true volumes . Whole body plethysmography imperfectly measures these parameters without corrections for humidity and temperature . However , since humidity and temperature are largely stable between recordings , because they are conducted in a temperature and humidity stable mouse facility , the estimated airflow ( mL/sec . ) and tidal volume ( mL ) can be compared in saline vs . morphine or pre and post-Cre virus injection studies . Additionally , in some instances respiratory parameters are appropriately normalized to animal weight in order to accurately compare between animals . However , this normalization is not appropriate for our study since lung volume in mice does not change in adulthood ( Mitzner et al . , 2001 ) , and all respiratory measurements are compared statistically as the ratio of saline to morphine injections within the same animal . The analysis was performed with custom Matlab code available on Github with a sample dataset ( Bachmutsky , 2020 , https://github . com/YackleLab/Opioids-depress-breathing-through-two-small-brainstem-sites; copy archived at https://github . com/elifesciences-publications/Opioids-depress-breathing-through-two-small-brainstem-sites ) . Due to limitations in breeding , a power calculation was not explicitly performed before our studies . Studies were conducted on all mice generated; six cohorts of animals . After respiration was measured , mice were sacrificed and injection sites were validated before inclusion of the data for further statistical analysis . We first conducted a Shapiro-Wilk normality on the average values ( averaged across breaths ) of the pre- and post-morphine respiratory parameters ( e . g . , peak inspiratory flow , instantaneous frequency ) from n = 29 animals . We then used either paired Student’s t-test ( if normal ) or Wilcox Rank Sum test ( if not normal ) to evaluate statistical significance in comparing the distribution of these values . In comparisons of Oprm1-deleted vs . Sham conditions a mixed-repeated measure two-way ANOVA was performed to determine if these two groups were significantly different . Post-hoc Student’s t or Wilcox Rank Sum tests were then used to evaluate statistical significance between normalized ( morphine/saline , or morphine-saline ) respiratory parameters for intact vs . Oprm1 deleted or intact vs . Sham conditions . Normality in this case was determined by Shapiro-Wilk test on the distribution of normalized respiratory parameters from n = 29 animals . All the above statistics were performed using the publicly available Excel package ‘Real Statistics Functions’ and SPSS . Mice were injected with saline ( control trials ) or 20 mg/kg morphine . 15 min later mice were put into a restraining wire mesh with the tail exposed . One-third of the tail was dipped into a 48–50°C water bath and time was measured for the tail to flick . Immediately after the flick , the tail was removed from the bath . If the tail did not flick within 10 s , then the tail was removed . The procedure was video recorded so time to response could be quantified post-hoc . Each mouse was recorded for two saline and two morphine trials . Bilateral stereotaxic injections were performed in mice anesthetized by isoflurane . Coordinates used for the preBötC were: −6 . 75 mm posterior , −5 . 05 mm ventral from surface , ±1 . 3 mm lateral from bregma . Coordinates used for the PBN/KF were: −5 . 05 mm posterior , −3 . 7 ventral from surface , ±1 . 7 lateral from bregma . Injection sites specificity was confirmed by the restricted expression of Cre-GFP , GFP , or tdTomato centered in the anatomically defined Parabrachial/Kolliker-Fuse ( Levitt et al . , 2015 ) and preBötC ( Smith et al . , 1991; Feldman et al . , 2013 ) areas . In the case of preBötC injections , anatomical location of injection site was also confirmed by localization with Somatostatin antibody staining ( Tan et al . , 2008 ) . µ-Opioid receptor deletion was not explicitly demonstrated by immunohistochemistry . After injection of the virus , mice recovered for at least 3–4 weeks before breathing metrics were recorded again . In a subset of animals , mice were then subject to a second site deletion of the complementary brain area , ie . preBötC and then from the PBN/KF ( Cohort 1 ) or vice versa ( Cohort 2 ) . These mice were then allowed to recover for another period of at least 3–4 weeks , after which a third set of breathing metrics were recorded . A subset of PBN/KF injected mice had only unilateral expression of Cre and their use is acknowledged in the text . Rhythmic 550 to 650 μm-thick transverse medullary slices which contain the preBötC and cranial nerve XII ( XIIn ) from neonatal Oprm1f/f , Oprm1f/f;Slc17a6-Cre+/- , Oprm1f/f;Gad2-Cre+/- , Oprm1f/f;Slc6a5-Cre+/- , Oprm1f/f;Slc32a1-Cre+/- , Oprm1f/f;Dbx1-Cre+/- , Oprm1f/f;Foxp2-Cre+/- ( P0-5 ) were prepared as described ( Ruangkittisakul et al . , 2014 ) . Briefly , slices were cut in ACSF containing ( in mM ) : 124 NaCl , 3 KCl , 1 . 5 CaCl2 , 1 MgSO4 , 25 NaHCO3 , 0 . 5 NaH2PO4 , and 30 D-glucose , equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 ( 4°C , pH = 7 . 4 ) . The rostral portion of the slice was taken once the compact nucleus ambiguus was visualized . The dorsal side of each slice containing the closing of the 4th ventricle . For recordings , slices were incubated with ACSF from above and the extracellular K+ was raised to 9 mM and temperature to 27°C . Slices equilibrated for 20 min before experiments were started . The preBötC neural activity was recorded from either XIIn rootlet or as population activity directly from the XII motor nucleus using suction electrodes . Activity was recorded with a MultiClamp700A or B using pClamp9 at 10000 Hz and low/high pass filtered at 3/400 Hz . After equilibration , 20 min . of baseline activity was collected and then increasing concentrations of DAMGO ( ab120674 ) were bath applied ( 20 nM , 50 nM , 100 nM , 500 nM ) . Activity was recorded for 20 min . after each DAMGO application . After the rhythm was eliminated or 500 nM DAMGO was reached , 100 nM Naloxone ( Sigma Aldrich N7758 ) was bath applied to demonstrate slice viability . Rhythmic activity was normalized to the first control recording for dose response curves . 650 µm-thick medullary slices containing the preBötC were prepared from 10 P0 mice C57Bl/6 mice as described above . The preBötC and surrounding tissue was punched out of each slice with a P200 pipette tip and incubated in bubbled ACSF containing 1 mg/ml pronase for 30 min at 37°C with intermittent movement . Digested tissue was centrifuged at 800 rpm for 1 min , and the supernatant was discarded and replaced with 1% FBS in bubbled ACSF . The cell suspension was triturated serially with fire-polished pipettes with ~600 µm , ~300 µm and ~150 µm diameter . The cells were filtered using a 40 µm cell strainer ( Falcon 352340 ) . DAPI was added to a final concentration of 1 µg/mL . The cell suspension was FACS sorted on a BD FACS AriaII for living ( DAPI negative ) single cells . The cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 5 min and resuspended in 30 µL 0 . 04% BSA in PBS . The library was prepared using the 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3' Library and Gel Bead Kit v2 ( 1206267 ) and according to manufacturer’s instructions by the Gladstone genomics core . The final libraries were sequenced on HiSeq 4000 . For analysis , sequencing reads were processed using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v . 2 . 01 pipeline . A total of 1860 cells were sequenced . Further analysis was performed using Seurat v2 . 3 . Cells with less than 200 genes were removed from the dataset . Data was LogNormalized and scaled at 1e4 . Highly variable genes were identified and used for principal component analysis . 25 principal components were used for unsupervised clustering using the FindCluster function . 12 clusters were identified at a resolution of 1 . 0 , displayed in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 . FindAllMarkers and violin plots of known cell type markers were used to identify each cluster .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']",['neuroscience'],elife-52694-v2,108,6145,6037,56.898148148148145

Certain animal species can sense the Earth’s magnetic field for the purposes of navigation . How that compass sense works is perhaps the last true mystery of sensory biology . If we knew how the magnetic field affects the activity of nerve cells , we could harness that mechanism to create new biomedical tools . One technological goal is to genetically engineer specific cells in the brain or elsewhere so their activity can be controlled using an external magnet . This dream has been called “magnetogenetics” . In recent months a string of reports claimed to have solved both the scientific and the technological challenges of magnetogenetics . They all involved the discovery or the engineering of protein molecules that are sensitive to magnetic fields . Markus Meister has now checked whether those claims were consistent with well-established physical laws . For each case , Meister calculated how strongly the protein in question would link magnetic fields to cellular activity . The results show that the predicted effects are too weak to account for the reported measurements by huge margins: between five and ten orders of magnitude . It therefore appears that none of these reports have hit on a solution to magnetogenetics . All of the proposed proteins use iron atoms to couple to the magnetic field , but Meister concludes that these proteins contain far too few iron atoms . How safe is that conclusion ? There has been enormous technological interest in making tiny magnets; for example , to design the ever-denser data storage drives inside computers . Hence the magnetism of small clusters of atoms is exceedingly well understood . If any of the biological reports of magnetogenetics turned out correct , they would force a revolutionary rethinking of basic physics . With the recognition that magnetogenetics remains unsolved , and that different approaches are needed , Meister hopes that other investigators will feel motivated to continue innovating in this area .","This is an analysis of how magnetic fields affect biological molecules and cells . It was prompted by a series of prominent reports regarding magnetism in biological systems . The first claims to have identified a protein complex that acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals ( Qin et al . , 2016 ) . Two other articles report magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then tugging the ferritin or heating it with a magnetic field ( Stanley et al . , 2015; Wheeler et al . , 2016 ) . Here I argue that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics . The discrepancies are large: from 5 to 10 log units . If the reported phenomena do in fact occur , they must have causes entirely different from the ones proposed by the authors . The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes is found to seriously limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells . 
 There has been renewed interest recently in the effects of magnetic fields on biological cells . On the one hand we have the old puzzle of magnetosensation: How do organisms sense the Earth’s magnetic field for the purpose of navigation ? The biophysical basis for this ability is for the most part unresolved . On the other hand lies the promise of 'magnetogenetics': the dream of making neurons and other cells responsive to magnetic fields for the purpose of controlling their activity with ease . The two are closely linked , because uncovering Nature’s method for magnetosensation can point the way to effectively engineering magnetogenetics . The physical laws by which magnetic fields act on matter are taught to science students in college ( Feynman et al . , 1963 ) . Obviously those principles impose some constraints on what biological mechanisms are plausible candidates , for both magnetosensation and magnetogenetics . A recent spate of high-profile articles has put forward audacious proposals in this domain without any attempt at such reality checks . My goal here is to offer some calculations as a supplement to those articles , which makes them appear in a rather different light . These arguments should also help in evaluating future hypotheses and in engineering new molecular tools . 
 Generally speaking , magnetic fields interact only weakly with biological matter . The reason magnetic fields are used for whole-body medical imaging , and why they have such appeal for magnetogenetics , is that they penetrate through tissues essentially undisturbed . The other side of this coin is that evolution had to develop rather special mechanisms to sense a magnetic field at all , especially one as weak as the Earth’s field . This mechanism is well understood in just one case: that of magnetotactic bacteria ( Bazylinski and Frankel , 2004 ) . These organisms are found commonly in ponds , and they prefer to live in the muck at the bottom rather than in open water . When the muck gets stirred up they need to return to the bottom , and they accomplish this by following the magnetic field lines down . For that purpose , the bacterium synthesizes ferrimagnetic crystals of magnetite and arranges them in a chain within the cell . This gives the bacterium a permanent magnetic moment , and allows it to act like a small compass needle . The cell’s long axis aligns with the magnetic field and flagella in the back of the cell propel it along the field lines . It has been suggested that magnetosensation in animals similarly relies on a magnetite mechanism , for example by coupling the movement of a small magnetic crystal to a membrane channel ( Kirschvink et al . , 2001 ) . A competing proposal for magnetosensation suggests that the magnetic field acts on single molecules in certain biochemical reactions ( Ritz et al . , 2010 ) . In this so-called 'radical pair mechanism' the products of an electron transfer reaction depend on the equilibrium between singlet and triplet states of a reaction intermediate , and this equilibrium can be biased by an applied magnetic field . These two hypotheses and their respective predictions for magnetosensation have been reviewed extensively ( Johnsen and Lohmann , 2005; Kirschvink et al . , 2010 ) . On this background , a recent article by Qin et al . ( 2016 ) introduces a new proposal . As for magnetotactic bacteria , the principle is that of a compass needle that aligns with the magnetic field , but here the needle consists of a single macromolecule . This putative magnetic receptor protein was isolated from the fruit fly and forms a rod-shaped multimeric complex that includes 40 iron atoms . The authors imaged individual complexes by electron microscopy on a sample grid . They claim ( 1 ) that each such rod has an intrinsic magnetic moment , and ( 2 ) that this moment is large enough to align the rods with the earth’s magnetic field: “about 45% of the isolated rod-like protein particles oriented with their long axis roughly parallel to the geomagnetic field” . We will see that neither claim is plausible based on first principles: With the goal of controlling the activity of neurons , Wheeler et al . ( 2016 ) reported the design of a molecular system intended to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the cell membrane . Their single-component protein consists of a putative mechano-sensitive cation channel ( TRPV4 ) fused on the intracellular face to two subunits of ferritin . The hope was that “the paramagnetic protein would enable magnetic torque to tug open the channel to depolarize cells” . Indeed , the report includes experimental results from several preparations suggesting that neural activity can be modulated by static magnetic fields ( There is a similar claim in Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) ; but the evidence is scant and hard to interpret: only 18 of ~2000 cells 'responded' ( their Supplementary Figure 10 ) ) . What could be the underlying biophysical mechanism ? Ferritin is a large protein complex with 24 subunits that forms a spherical shell about 12 nm in diameter . Wheeler et al . ( 2016 ) suppose optimistically that the two subunits of ferritin attached to the channel protein are able to nucleate an entire 24-subunit ferritin complex . The hollow core of this particle can be filled with iron in the form of a ferric hydroxide ( Arosio et al . , 2009 ) . At room temperature ferritin has no permanent magnetization: it is strictly paramagnetic or superparamagnetic ( Papaefthymiou , 2010 ) . Unlike the magnetite particles in magnetotactic bacteria , the iron core of ferritin is too small ( ~5 nm ) to sustain a permanent dipole moment ( blocking temperature ~40 K ) . Instead the direction of the Fe spins in the core fluctuates thermally . An external magnetic field biases these fluctuations , producing a magnetic moment m proportional to the field B of ( 7 ) m= ξB , where ξ is the magnetizability of a ferritin particle . This quantity can be derived from bulk measurements of ferritin magnetic susceptibility ( see Methods ) at ( 8 ) ξ=2 . 4×10−22JT2 . I will consider four scenarios by which such a ferritin particle might be manipulated with an external magnetic field . In the first , the magnetic field has a gradient , and the particle is pulled in the direction of higher field strength . In the second , the force arises from interactions among neighboring ferritins through their induced magnetic moments . In the third , the magnetic field exerts a torque assuming that the ferritin core is anisotropic , with a preferred axis of magnetization . Finally , the collective pull of many ferritins on the cell membrane may induce a stress that opens stretch-activated channels . For a different mode of activating membrane channels , Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) combined the expression of ferritin protein with that of the temperature-sensitive membrane channel TRPV1 . The hope was that a high-frequency magnetic field could be used to heat the iron core of ferritin , leading to a local temperature increase sufficient to open the TRPV1 channels , allowing cations to flow into the cell . Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) compared three different options for interaction between the ion channels in the plasma membrane and the ferritin protein: In one case the ferritin was expressed in the cytoplasm , in another it was targeted to the membrane by a myristoyl tail , and in the third it was tethered directly to the channel protein by a camelid antibody linkage . The direct one-to-one linkage between ferritin and ion channel worked best for generating Ca influx via high-frequency magnetic fields , leading the authors to conclude that “Because temperature decays as the inverse distance from the particle surface , heat transfer is likely to be most efficient for this construct , suggesting that heat transfer from the particle could be limiting the efficiency of the other constructs . ” Here I consider whether heat transfer from the ferritin particle is a likely source of thermal activation for the TRPV1 channel at all . Magnetic heating of nanoparticles is indeed a very active area of research ( Pankhurst et al . , 2003 ) . A sample biomedical application is to inject nanoparticles into cancerous tissue , and then damage the tumor selectively by magnetic heating ( Hergt et al . , 2006; Maier-Hauff et al . , 2011 ) . Typical nanoparticles of interest are made of magnetite or maghemite , sometimes doped with other metals , and measure some tens of nanometers in size ( Hergt et al . , 2006 ) . A typical heating apparatus for small preparations – like in the experiments of Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) – consists of an electric coil with a few windings , several centimeters in diameter , that carries a large oscillating current . The magnetic fields generated inside the coil are on the order of tens of kA/m at frequencies of several 100 kHz ( The literature sometimes refers misleadingly to heating by “radio waves” or “electromagnetic radiation” . At these frequencies the wavelength of a radio wave is about a kilometer , so of no practical relevance to the experiments . There is no radiation involved in the interaction between the solenoid coil and the nanoparticle ) . Owing to the small size of the nanoparticles , the physics of heating are quite different from the processes in our kitchen . A microwave oven heats water primarily by flipping molecular dipoles in an oscillating electric field . And an induction stove works by inducing electric eddy currents in the pot’s bottom with an oscillating magnetic field . Neither of these electric effects plays any role for nanoparticles . Instead the heat is generated purely by magnetic forces ( Hergt et al . , 2006 ) . Part of this comes from reorienting the magnetization of the material at high frequency , which is opposed by the particle’s magnetic anisotropy , causing dissipation and heat . For larger nanoparticles , the oscillating magnetic field may also make the particle move , with resulting dissipation from external friction in the surrounding medium . These physical processes have been modeled in great detail , and there is a large experimental literature to determine the heating rates that can be accomplished with different kinds of nanoparticles . A figure of merit is the “specific loss power ( SLP ) ” , namely the heating power that can be generated per unit mass of the magnetic material ( see Materials and methods ) . What sort of heating rate would we expect for the ferritin particles used by Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) ? Given the long-standing interest in ferritin for medical engineering ( Babincova et al . , 2000 ) , the extensive research on its magnetic properties ( Papaefthymiou , 2010 ) , and the ease with which magnetic heating can be measured , it is surprisingly difficult to find any published evidence for magnetic heating in ferritin . One report on the subject concludes simply that there is none: ferritin shells reconstituted with a magnetite core produced no measurable magnetic heating ( SLP < 0 . 1 W/g ) , whereas doping the iron with varying amounts of cobalt did produce some modest heating rates ( Fantechi et al . , 2014 ) . Why is native ferritin such a poor heater ? Both theory and experiment show that the efficiency of heating magnetic nanoparticles depends strongly on the particle size , and plummets steeply below 10 nm ( Fortin et al . , 2007; Purushotham and Ramanujan , 2010 ) . Magnetite particles smaller than 8 nm are not considered useful for magnetic hyperthermia ( Fantechi et al . , 2015 ) . The iron core of ferritin measures only 5–6 nm in diameter . Furthermore , the ferric hydroxide material in native ferritin has much lower magnetic susceptibility than magnetite ( ~8-fold , Zborowski et al . , 1996 ) . So , based on the literature , the heating rate for ferritin is too low to be measurable . Obviously this casts doubt on the claims of Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) that they activated ion channels through heating ferritin . For the sake of keeping the argument alive , and to evaluate potential future developments , let us instead suppose that ferritin could be engineered to produce a specific heating rate of ( 17 ) P=30Wg of metal This is the highest value obtained by filling the ferritin shell with cobalt-doped magnetite ( Fantechi et al . , 2014 ) and thus a generous estimate of what might be accomplished by future engineering of ferritin complexes inside cells . Assuming this specific heating rate , a single ferritin particle with 2400 iron atoms generates heat at a rate of ( 18 ) Q=7×10−18W This heat flux will produce a temperature gradient in the surrounding medium ( Figure 2 ) . As Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) state , the temperature indeed decays as the inverse distance r from the particle ( Feynman et al . , 1963 , Ch 12 ) , namely ( 19 ) T ( r ) =Q4πκ1r where ( 20 ) κ=0 . 61 Wm⋅K is the thermal conductivity of water . Right at the surface of the ferritin sphere the temperature increase is highest , namely ( 21 ) Tferritin=T ( 6 nm ) =1 . 5×10−10K This is a very tiny increase . Activation of a TRPV1 channel requires about 5 K of increase relative to body temperature ( Cao et al . , 2013 ) . So the temperature increase expected , even from a futuristic optimized ferritin , is more than 10 orders of magnitude too small . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17210 . 004Figure 2 . The steady-state temperature profile around a heated sphere in an infinite bath varies inversely with the distance from the center of the sphere . The same argument applies to a ferritin sphere heated from its magnetic core ( top ) and a spherical cell with a large number of heated ferritins on its surface ( bottom ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 17210 . 004 The assumption underlying Equation ( 19 ) is that thermal transport from the magnetic particle to the surrounding medium follows Fourier’s Law , in which the heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient . This is a good approximation , as long as the length scales of the problem are large compared to the mean free path of the heat carriers , which are phonons in the current problem . In water , the phonon mean free path is ~0 . 3 nm , about the size of a water molecule ( Rabin , 2002 ) . Indeed , all the relevant dimensions are at least 10-fold larger than that , namely the size of the ferritin particle , the size of the ion channel protein , and the distance from ferritin to ion channel . One therefore expects that non-Fourier heat transport will make only small corrections to the above results , on the order of 10% or less ( Chen , 1996 ) . Another effect resulting from thermal physics at small scales is the thermal resistance to heat flow at the boundary between two materials . A given heat flux across the boundary will produce a discontinuous step in temperature between the two materials . How large is this step for heated nanoparticles ? Ge et al . ( 2004 ) followed thermal transfer between a metal nanoparticle with organic coating and the surrounding water , and observed a thermal conductance of ( 22 ) G=2×108Wm2⋅K , largely independent of particle size . With the heat flux produced by our ferritin particle the resulting temperature step would be ( 23 ) ΔTferritin=Q4πR21G=7×10−11K . Again , an exceedingly tiny contribution . It appears that there is no possibility of raising the temperature by several degrees near a single nanoparticle , even if the heating rate were 1000-fold higher . While there have been isolated reports of such magnetic heating effects near synthetic nanoparticles ( Huang et al . , 2010; Riedinger et al . , 2013; Piñol et al . , 2015 ) , they have met a good amount of skepticism . As has been pointed out repeatedly , there is no known physical mechanism for such an effect ( Rabin , 2002; Keblinski et al . , 2006; Gupta et al . , 2010 ) , and it has been suggested that the underlying methods of thermometry should be reevaluated ( Dutz and Hergt , 2013; 2014 ) . Moving on from single-particle heating one may ask whether the many other ferritins expressed on the same cell , though they are at greater distance , might contribute to heating the local environment . Suppose one can express Nferritins=10 , 000 TRPV1-ferritin complexes on the surface of a spherical cell with rcell=5μm radius . That is about 10-fold the natural expression level in sensory neurons . One can treat the heat production of those 10 , 000 ferritins as distributed evenly over the surface of the cell . Then the temperature gradient outside the cell again follows a 1/r profile ( Figure 2 ) . At the surface of the cell the resulting temperature increase will be ( 24 ) Tcell=Q Nferritins4π κ rcell=1 . 7×10−9K Unfortunately this is still too low by 9 orders of magnitude . So one cannot achieve activation of single neurons this way , which is of course a central goal of genetically expressed activators . Suppose now that one expresses this number of ferritin-TRPV1 complexes on every neuron in the brain . Would that perhaps be sufficient to heat the entire organ ? At that density , the heating rate per unit mass of brain will be ( 25 ) Pbrain=Q Nferritins43π rcell31ρbrain=1 . 2×10−4Wg , where ρbrain=1 . 03 g/cm3 is the specific density . For comparison , the resting metabolic rate of brain tissue is ~1 . 2×10−2 W/g , and the resulting heat is carried away and regulated by the processes that keep the organ’s temperature stable . Heating of ferritin throughout the entire brain would therefore contribute only a 1% increase to the heat already being generated from basal activity: this will not overwhelm the homothermic regulation mechanisms sufficiently to open TRPV1 channels . In summary , it seems very unlikely that the effects reported in Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) have anything to do with heating ferritin . The available evidence says that native ferritin produces no measurable magnetic heating at all . Even if we ignore that and assume a generous heating rate , namely the largest reported using a custom metal alloy for the ferritin core , the resulting effects are too small to matter by enormous factors of 1010 ( single-channel activation ) and 109 ( for single-neuron activation ) . 
 The calculations presented here evaluate the mechanisms that might underlie recent observations on a molecular compass ( Qin et al . , 2016 ) and neural activation with static magnetic fields ( Wheeler et al . , 2016 ) or high-frequency magnetic fields ( Stanley et al . , 2015 ) . These calculations show that none of the biophysical schemes proposed in these articles is even remotely plausible , and a few additional proposals were eliminated along the way . The forces or torques or temperatures they produce are too small by many orders of magnitude for the desired effects on molecular orientation or on membrane channels . If the phenomena occurred as described , they must rely on some entirely different mechanism . Barring dramatic new discoveries about the structure of biological matter , the proposed routes to magnetogenetics , based on either pulling or heating a ferritin/channel complex with magnetic fields , have no chance of success . One does have to ask why none of these authors attempted a back-of-the-envelope estimate to bolster the claims in their papers . Neither , it seems , did the referees who reviewed the manuscripts , nor the authors of three pieces that heralded these articles ( Leibiger and Berggren , 2015; Lewis , 2016; Lohmann , 2016 ) . Why is it important to do so ? First of all , claims that violate the known laws of physics often turn out to be wrong ( Maddox et al . , 1988 ) . There is , of course , always a small chance of discovering new physics , but only if one understands what the old physics predicts and recognizes the discrepancy . If any of the claims in these articles were substantiated – a room-temperature molecular magnet or measurable forces and heating from ferritin – their implications for our basic understanding of nanoscale matter would far outweigh their biological significance . More importantly though , calculations are most useful when done ahead of time , to guide the design of experiments . For example , Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) and Wheeler et al . ( 2016 ) evoke an image in which the magnetic field pulls on the ferritin particles . This is possible only if the magnetic field has a strong gradient ( Figure 1a , Equation 10 ) . None of their experiments on animals were designed to produce a strong gradient , nor do the articles report what it was . It is in fact possible to pull on cells that express lots of ferritin , and this has been exploited for magnetic separation ( Owen and Lindsay , 1983 ) . It requires very high magnetic fields , and separation columns with a meshwork of fine steel fibers that produce strong gradients on a microscopic scale . Inserting such a wire mesh into the brain would of course negate the goal of non-invasive control . Two other hypothetical mechanisms for the ferritin effects require a strong field but no gradient . This would be of great experimental value , because a homogeneous magnetic field could then deliver the same control signal throughout an extended volume , like the brain of a mouse . Among these , the dipole interaction between ferritins ( Figure 1b , Equation 14 ) offers little hope . Even with a 100-fold larger field ( 5 T ) , these forces are still 4 log units too small to open a channel . That field strength represents a practical limit: Small movements of the animal , or switching of the field , will cause inductive eddy currents that activate the brain non-specifically , a phenomenon experienced also by MRI subjects ( Schenck et al . , 1992 ) . On the other hand , exploiting anisotropy of the ferritin particle ( Figure 1c , Equation 15 ) may be within range of utility . A 100-fold larger field could produce torque comparable with the thermal energy , which when applied to thousands of channels might have a noticeable effect on membrane currents . To enhance the shape anisotropy of the magnetic particles , perhaps one could engineer the ferritin shell into an elongated shape . More fundamentally , it is clear that the weak effects computed here are a consequence of ferritin’s paramagnetism . A particle with a permanent magnetic moment , such as the magnetosomes made by bacteria ( Bazylinski and Frankel , 2004 ) , could exert much larger forces , torques , and temperatures ( Hergt et al . , 2006 ) , and may offer a physically realistic route to magnetogenetics . With an eye towards such future developments , it is unfortunate that these three questionable claims were published , especially in high-profile journals , because that discourages further innovation . Now that the prize for magnetogenetics has seemingly been taken , what motivates a young scientist to focus on solving the problem for real ? There is an important function here for post-publication peer review: It can make up for pre-publication failures and thus reopen the claimed intellectual space for future pioneers . 
 Central to the arguments about magnetogenetics is the proportionality factor ξ between the magnetic moment m of a single ferritin molecule and the magnetic field B , ( 26 ) m= ξB . Experimental measurements are usually performed on bulk samples of ferritin and report the magnetic susceptibility χ , defined by ( 27 ) M= χH=χB/μ0 , where M is the magnetization of the material , namely the magnetic moment per unit volume , and ( 28 ) μ0=4π×10−7NA2 is the vacuum permeability . Therefore ( 29 ) ξ=χρμ0 , where ρ is the number of ferritin particles per unit volume . In practice , we will see that the reported measurements of magnetization are more often normalized by the iron content of the sample or by the mass , rather than by volume . Then the choice of ρ must be adjusted accordingly . Table 1 summarizes some published measurements on magnetic heating of small nanoparticles with diameter below 10 nm . The loss power per unit mass ( SLP ) depends on the apparatus used for heating . Over the range of conditions considered here , a good approximation is that SLP varies proportionally to the frequency of the alternating magnetic field and to the square of the field strength ( Hergt et al . , 2004 ) . The table therefore corrects all the SLP numbers to the conditions used by Stanley et al . ( 2015 ) : field strength H=B/μ0=25 . 5kA/m and frequency f=465kHz . 10 . 7554/eLife . 17210 . 005Table 1 .

A stem cell can divide to create either another stem cell , or a cell that will mature into one of many different cell types . Neuroblasts are a type of brain stem cell and can divide to create two new cells: another neuroblast that will continue to replicate itself and a cell called a ganglion mother cell that will go on to produce two mature cells for the nervous system . Moreover , when a neuroblast divides , it splits unequally , so that certain molecules end up predominantly in the ganglion mother cell—including a protein called Prospero . Once partitioned into the ganglion mother cell , the Prospero protein enters the nucleus , where it switches off ‘stem cell genes’ and switches on ‘neuron genes’ so the ganglion mother cell can form the mature neurons of the brain . Thus , neuroblasts must keep Prospero out of the nucleus to maintain stem cell properties , whereas ganglion mother cells must move Prospero into the nucleus to form neurons . Now , Lai and Doe discover a new way that the Prospero protein is used to control stem cell biology . Neuroblasts , like all stem cells , can enter periods where they go dormant or quiescent—that is , they temporarily stop generating ganglion mother cells . By analyzing which proteins are present in neuroblasts during this transition to quiescence , Lai and Doe discovered that the Prospero protein was briefly detected , at low levels , in the nucleus of the neuroblast just before it became dormant . To see whether this ‘low-level pulse’ of nuclear Prospero is linked to the cell entering a dormant state , Lai and Doe investigated two types of mutant fly in which neuroblasts become dormant either earlier or later than in normal flies . A low-level pulse of nuclear Prospero still precisely matched the start of the dormant state in both mutants . When the Prospero protein was removed altogether , the neuroblasts failed to become dormant , and instead continued dividing . Lai and Doe propose that different levels of Prospero distinguish three different fates for neuroblasts . Neuroblasts self-replicate when Prospero is kept out of the nucleus , become dormant when exposed to low level nuclear Prospero , and produce the mature cells of the brain when nuclear Prospero levels are high . Exactly how the intermediate levels of nuclear Prospero trigger the dormant state remains a question for future work , as is the question of whether the related mammalian protein , called Prox1 , has a similar function . Understanding how stem cells switch between cell division and quiescence is important for developing effective stem cell-based therapies . It could also help us understand cancer , as cancer cells go through similar periods of inactivity , during which they do not respond to many anti-tumor drugs .","Stem cells can self-renew , differentiate , or enter quiescence . Understanding how stem cells switch between these states is highly relevant for stem cell-based therapeutics . Drosophila neural progenitors ( neuroblasts ) have been an excellent model for studying self-renewal and differentiation , but quiescence remains poorly understood . In this study , we show that when neuroblasts enter quiescence , the differentiation factor Prospero is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus , followed by the establishment of a unique molecular profile lacking most progenitor and differentiation markers . The pulse of low level nuclear Prospero precedes entry into neuroblast quiescence even when the timing of quiescence is advanced or delayed by changing temporal identity factors . Furthermore , loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence , whereas a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence . We propose that Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal , low for quiescence , and high for differentiation . 
 Quiescent stem cells preserve the stem cell pool for activation following disease or injury . Moreover , cancer stem cells can enter remission during treatment , possibly using mechanisms similar to stem cell quiescence , and re-initiate proliferation months to years later . Thus , studying stem cell quiescence may help design clinical approaches to prevent tumor dormancy and cancer recurrence , as well as to aid in activating stem cells for tissue repair . Drosophila neuroblasts have served as a model system for identifying conserved signaling pathways that regulate stem cell proliferation and quiescence ( Ebens et al . , 1993; Datta , 1995; Britton and Edgar , 1998; Doe et al . , 1998; Egger et al . , 2008; Tsuji et al . , 2008; Sousa-Nunes et al . , 2010; Homem and Knoblich , 2012; Weng and Cohen , 2012 ) . Drosophila neuroblasts delaminate from neuroectoderm during early embryogenesis , and then they go through multiple rounds of asymmetric cell division before exiting cell cycle at the end of embryogenesis; upon cell cycle exit , neuroblasts can undergo apoptosis ( Karcavitch and Doe , 2005; Maurange and Gould , 2005; Ulvklo et al . , 2012 ) or enter quiescence ( Truman and Bate , 1988; Datta , 1995; Tsuji et al . , 2008; Chell and Brand , 2010; Sousa-Nunes et al . , 2011 ) . During neuroblast asymmetric division , the scaffolding protein Miranda ( Mira ) is partitioned into the differentiating daughter cell , called a ganglion mother cell ( GMC ) , and it carries at least three cargo proteins: the translational repressors Staufen and Brain tumor ( Brat ) and the transcriptional repressor Prospero ( Hirata et al . , 1995; Broadus and Doe , 1997; Ikeshima-Kataoka et al . , 1997; Broadus et al . , 1998; Schuldt et al . , 1998; Shen et al . , 1998; Bello et al . , 2006; Betschinger et al . , 2006; Lee et al . , 2006 ) . In the GMC , Mira appears to be degraded and its cargo is released into the cytoplasm ( Staufen , Brat ) or the nucleus ( Prospero ) . Prospero is an atypical homeodomain protein that directly binds and represses progenitor and cell cycle genes to initiate GMC and neuronal differentiation ( Li and Vaessin , 2000; Choksi et al . , 2006 ) ; the mammalian ortholog Prox1 has a similar role in repressing cell cycle gene expression ( Dyer , 2003; Foskolou et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , keeping high levels of Prospero out of the neuroblast nucleus is essential to prevent neuroblast differentiation ( Choksi et al . , 2006; Cabernard and Doe , 2009; Bayraktar et al . , 2010 ) . In this study , we show that the Prospero differentiation factor is transiently detected at low levels in the neuroblast nucleus just prior to entry into quiescence . We find that loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence , whereas a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero drives proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence . We propose a model in which low levels of Prospero repress all cell cycle and progenitor genes except deadpan , whereas high levels of Prospero additionally repress deadpan to allow neural differentiation . 
 To investigate the transition from a proliferating neuroblast to a quiescent neuroblast , we examined known proliferation/progenitor and differentiation marker expression during this transition . We hypothesized that loss of a progenitor marker or gain of a differentiation marker might induce neuroblast quiescence . As a model system we used the identified neuroblast 3–3 in the thoracic segments ( NB3-3T ) which reliably enters quiescence at embryonic stage 15 ( Tsuji et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , neuroblast 3–3 in abdominal segments ( NB3-3A ) remains proliferative until the end of embryogenesis and provides an excellent internal control ( Tsuji et al . , 2008 ) . Previous work showed that the quiescent NB3-3T can be recognized by Deadpan , a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor ( Zhu et al . , 2008; Chell and Brand , 2010 ) . The coiled-coil Miranda protein is also reported to mark quiescent neuroblasts ( Tsuji et al . , 2008 ) , which we confirm here ( Figure 1 ) , but note that mira transcription is down-regulated in quiescent neuroblasts based lack of mRNA in the stage 17 CNS in the BDGP in situ database ( Tomancak et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , we find that all other tested progenitor markers—Worniu , Asense , and Cyclin E ( CycE ) ( Brand et al . , 1993; Caldwell and Datta , 1998; Ashraf et al . , 2004; Lai et al . , 2012 ) —are not expressed in the quiescent NB3-3T ( Figure 1; data not shown ) , although they can be robustly detected in the proliferative NB3-3A ( Figure 1 ) . Similarly , larval quiescent neuroblasts lack expression of Worniu , Asense , CycE ( and Miranda ) , while retaining Deadpan protein and active deadpan transcription ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . However , misexpression of Worniu ( data not shown ) , Asense , or CycE ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) has no effect on the timing of NB3-3T quiescence . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03363 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03363 . 005 We next turned to examining differentiation markers . We assayed nuclear Prospero , which marks differentiating GMCs and young neurons in the larval CNS ( Carney et al . , 2013 ) , Embryonic lethal and abnormal vision ( Elav ) , which marks all neurons ( Robinow and White , 1988 ) ; and Reversed polarity ( Repo ) , which marks all non-midline glia ( Xiong et al . , 1994 ) . We found that the mature quiescent NB3-3T did not express nuclear Prospero , Elav , or Repo ( data not shown ) , nor were these differentiation markers observed in quiescent larval brain neuroblasts ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Interestingly , we did observe transient low level nuclear Prospero in NB3-3T just prior to its entry into quiescence ( see next section ) . We conclude that quiescent neuroblasts have a novel transcriptional profile that lacks both progenitor and differentiation markers . Here , we characterize further our observation that NB3-3T showed low level nuclear Prospero at stage 15 , concurrent with the entry into quiescence . Whereas NB3-3T showed a pulse of nuclear Prospero at stage 15 concurrent with entry into quiescence ( Figure 2A , B ) , NB3-3A did not show nuclear Prospero and did not enter quiescence ( Figure 2C , D ) . The levels of Prospero in the NB3-3T neuroblast are clearly detectable by immunofluorescent staining , but at significantly lower levels than in differentiating GMCs ( Figure 2B , arrow; Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . To probe the correlation of transient nuclear Prospero and neuroblast quiescence in more detail , we assayed temporal identity mutations that are known to shift the timing of NB3-3T quiescence: nubbin/pdm2 ( pdm ) mutants cause precocious NB3-3T quiescence , whereas castor ( cas ) mutants cause a delay in NB3-3T quiescence ( Tsuji et al . , 2008 ) . Strikingly , the pulse of nuclear Prospero precisely matched the timing of neuroblast quiescence: it occurred earlier in pdm mutants , and later in cas mutants ( Figure 2E , F ) . We conclude that a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero marks neuroblast entry into quiescence , suggesting a functional relationship . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03363 . 006Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03363 . 007 Having shown a strong correlation between the timing of nuclear Prospero and neuroblast entry into quiescence , we next asked if Prospero is required for neuroblast entry into quiescence and loss of nuclear Prospero can delay the timing of neuroblast quiescence . In theory , this can be done by quantifying the number of EdU+ neuroblasts in prospero null mutant embryos . The problem is that prospero mutants show de-differentiation of GMCs into proliferating neuroblasts ( Choksi et al . , 2006; Lee et al . , 2006 ) , making it necessary to distinguish the parental neuroblasts from the de-differentiated GMCs . To resolve the issue , we used the Notch signaling reporter , mγ-LacZ ( Wech et al . , 1999; Cooper et al . , 2000 ) , to identify the parental neuroblasts . During neuroblast asymmetric cell division , Miranda-Prospero and Partner of numb ( Pon ) -Numb protein complexes are independently segregated into the GMC to promote differentiation ( Doe , 2008 ) . In prospero mutants , Numb is still properly segregated to GMCs where it represses Notch activity ( Spana and Doe , 1995 ) and consequently the Notch reporter mγ-LacZ is restricted to parental neuroblasts . mγ-LacZ is transcribed only in neuroblasts; in wild type the protein perdures into neuroblast progeny , whereas in prospero mutants the protein is restricted to neuroblasts because the progeny proliferate without expressing mγ-LacZ and thus dilute out the protein ( Choksi et al . , 2006; Figure 3A , B ) . Thus , we scored for EdU incorporation in the mγ-LacZ+ parental neuroblasts . Whereas in wild type nearly all neuroblasts ceased EdU incorporation by stage 16 ( Figure 3A ) , many mγ-LacZ+ neuroblasts continued to incorporate EdU in prospero mutants at the same stage ( Figure 3B ) . This strongly supports a model in which Prospero is required for neuroblast entry into quiescence . In addition , Prospero is unique among basal cell fate determinants in regulating neuroblast quiescence: loss of function mutations in numb or brat , or the Prospero target gene string , showed no effect on the timing of neuroblast quiescence ( data not shown ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03363 . 008Figure 3 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03363 . 008 To test further whether Prospero is required for neuroblast quiescence , we returned to the NB3-3T model system . We used mγ-LacZ , Miranda , and EdU incorporation to assay the timing of NB3-3T quiescence in wild type and prospero mutant embryos . In both wild type and prospero haplo-insufficiency embryos , the mγ-LacZ+ NB3-3T was proliferative at stage 14 and quiescent by stage 16 ( Figure 3C , quantified in Figure 3E ) . In prospero mutant embryos , the mγ-LacZ+ NB3-3T was proliferative at both stage 14 and 16 ( Figure 3D , quantified in Figure 3E ) . The results suggest that the level of Prospero required for neuroblast quiescence is lower than that in prospero haplo-insufficiency and that a low level of Prospero is sufficient to promote neuroblast quiescence ( see next section ) . We conclude that Prospero is required for neuroblast quiescence . The central brain neuroblasts are continuously proliferating during the third larval instar ( Ito and Hotta , 1992 ) , and so we used this stage to determine whether transient Prospero expression could induce neuroblast quiescence . We used the TARGET method ( McGuire et al . , 2003 ) to transiently induce Prospero expression for 2 hr , and then assayed for neuroblast quiescence 12 hr later ( Figure 4 ) . Because high levels of Prospero can induce neuroblast differentiation ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) ( Choksi et al . , 2006; Cabernard and Doe , 2009; Bayraktar et al . , 2010 ) , we used Prospero levels low enough to minimize neuroblast differentiation , as shown by the persistence of most Deadpan+ neuroblasts after misexpression ( Figure 4D ) . We identified quiescent neuroblasts by their failure to incorporate EdU , lack of progenitor marker Worniu , and lack of the differentiation marker Elav—together a robust signature for quiescent neuroblasts ( see Figure 1 ) . In wild-type larval brains , we found few or no quiescent neuroblasts , as expected ( Figure 4E , F ) . In contrast , a pulse of Prospero resulted in the appearance of numerous quiescent neuroblasts ( Figure 4E , F; 12 hr timepoint ) . To rule out the possibility that these ‘quiescent neuroblasts’ were early in the differentiation pathway , we reasoned that if they were quiescent they could reactivate proliferation in a nourishing environment ( Chell and Brand , 2010; Sousa-Nunes et al . , 2010 ) whereas if they were differentiating they would never re-enter the cell cycle . Thus , we exposed larval neuroblasts to the same 2 hr pulse of Prospero , but waited 24 hr to assay neuroblasts . We found that nearly all of the neuroblasts that were quiescent at 12 hr after induction had reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers ( Figure 4E , F; 24 hr timepoint ) . In addition , precocious low level nuclear Prospero could advance the timing of NB3-3T quiescence ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) . We conclude that transient , low-level nuclear Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence . Interestingly , Prospero can also transiently arrest the cell cycle without inducing differentiation in embryonic longitudinal glial progenitors ( Griffiths and Hidalgo , 2004 ) , although the relative levels of Prospero have not been explored in this system . 10 . 7554/eLife . 03363 . 009Figure 4 .

Third-instar larvae were shifted from 22°C to 30°C to inactivate Gal80 , which resulted in nuclear Prospero in neuroblasts .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 03363 . 011 Our results confirm that high levels of Prospero can trigger differentiation and reveal that low levels of Prospero induce quiescence in the Drosophila neuroblasts . High levels of the vertebrate ortholog Prox1 can also trigger differentiation ( Dyer , 2003; Takahashi et al . , 2006; Foskolou et al . , 2013 ) ; thus it is interesting that low levels of nuclear Prospero promote neuroblast quiescence without triggering differentiation ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Prox1 activates some target genes at high levels but represses some target genes at low levels ( Chen et al . , 2008a , 2008b ) . We suggest a speculative model for Prospero function: low levels of Prospero are sufficient to repress most progenitor-specific genes in neuroblasts ( worniu , asense , miranda , and cycE ) but do not repress the expression of deadpan ( perhaps due to lack of high affinity Prospero binding sites ) . In contrast , high levels of Prospero are sufficient to repress deadpan ( perhaps via low affinity binding sites ) and may even activate neuronal differentiation genes ( Figure 4G ) . In embryonic neuroblasts , the temporal transcription factors Pdm and Cas schedule the timing of neuroblast quiescence , but how they regulate Prospero nuclear import is unknown . In larval neuroblasts , Grh prevents accumulation of nuclear Prospero which would induce neuroblast cell cycle exit and differentiation ( Maurange et al . , 2008; Chai et al . , 2013 ) , again by an unknown mechanism . The protein Caliban is known to promote Prospero nuclear export in S2 cells ( Bi et al . , 2005 ) , but it is unknown whether Caliban has a similar role in neuroblasts or if down-regulation of Caliban levels or activity leads to increased nuclear Prospero in neuroblasts entering quiescence .

Once their larvae enter the body , they head to the gut where they mature into adults and start laying eggs . In areas with poor sanitation , these may then get passed on to other individuals . To defend the body , the immune system sends large numbers of immune cells to the gut , but it usually struggles to eliminate the parasites . Without deworming medication , the infection can last for many years . Scientists study helminth infections in the laboratory by using worms that naturally infect mice . Understanding exactly how the immune system responds to the infection is essential to grasp why it fails to clear the worms . However , it is difficult to extract immune cells from an infected gut , as the infection creates strong local responses – such as an intense ‘slime’ production to try to flush out the worms . The standard procedure to obtain immune cells from the gut consists of three steps: collecting a gut segment and washing it , stripping away the surface layers with chemicals , and finally using enzymes to digest the tissues , which are then filtered to obtain individual cells . However , this protocol is not able to extract cells during infection . Ferrer-Font et al . therefore methodically refined every step of this method , and finally succeeded in obtaining millions of immune cells from infected guts . For the first time , these cells could then be studied and identified using a new technology called spectral flow cytometry . Over 40 immune cell types were followed throughout the course of infection , revealing that many ‘first responders’ immune cells were recruited to the gut early on , when the worms were still larvae . However , these cells disappeared once the worms developed into adults . These findings were confirmed by microscopy , which also showed that the first responder cells were found around the developing larvae , likely attacking them . When the adult worms developed , these cells were replaced by other immune cells , which also decreased the longer the worms were present in the gut . This new extraction process established by Ferrer-Font et al . can also be paired with other technologies that can , for example , reveal which genes are turned on in individual cells . This could help map out exactly how the body fights helminth infections , and how to improve this response . The method could also be useful to extract immune cells from the gut in other challenging scenarios , such food allergies or inflammatory bowel disorders .","Single cell isolation from helminth-infected murine intestines has been notoriously difficult , due to the strong anti-parasite type 2 immune responses that drive mucus production , tissue remodeling and immune cell infiltration . Through the systematic optimization of a standard intestinal digestion protocol , we were able to successfully isolate millions of immune cells from the heavily infected duodenum . To validate that these cells gave an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses , we analyzed them using a high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry panel and confirmed our findings by confocal microscopy . Our cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed us to identify many known hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection and has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses that have previously been unfeasible . 
 Recent advances in single cell analysis have significantly increased our understanding of multiple diseases and cell types in different tissues ( Svensson et al . , 2018; Hwang et al . , 2018 ) . However , many of these technologies require single cell suspensions as an input , which limits our assessment of difficult-to-process tissues ( Hwang et al . , 2018; Nguyen et al . , 2018; Chen et al . , 2018 ) . One prominent example is the intestine , which is at the center of many research questions that focus on nutrient uptake ( Kiela and Ghishan , 2016 ) , host-microbiome interactions ( Belkaid and Hand , 2014; Tilg et al . , 2019; Sekirov et al . , 2010 ) , local and systemic immune tolerance ( Worbs et al . , 2006; Harrison and Powrie , 2013; Whibley et al . , 2019 ) and gastrointestinal diseases and infections ( Mowat and Agace , 2014; Sell and Dolan , 2018; Fletcher et al . , 2013; Hendrickson et al . , 2002; Saleh and Elson , 2011 ) , but represents a challenging tissue to digest ( Weigmann et al . , 2007; Reißig et al . , 2014 ) . The standard digestion procedure to isolate intestinal immune cells located in the small intestinal lamina propria consists of three steps ( Weigmann et al . , 2007; Reißig et al . , 2014; Scott et al . , 2016; Esterházy et al . , 2019 ) ( Figure 1a ) . First the intestinal segment of interest is collected , opened longitudinally to remove its luminal content , washed and cut into small pieces . These pieces then undergo several wash steps with EDTA containing wash buffers at 37°C to remove the epithelial layer and make the lamina propria accessible for enzymatic digestion . Lastly , the tissue is enzymatically digested with collagenases ( Collagenase VIII from Clostridium histolyticum being among the most popular ) and later filtered to obtain a single cell suspension . While this method results in a high cell yield from steady state intestines , the isolation of cells from severely infected segments remains challenging ( Reißig et al . , 2014; Scott et al . , 2016; Webster et al . , 2020 ) ( Figure 1b ) . One of the most prominent examples are infections with intestinal helminths , which represent over 50% of all parasitic infections in human and livestock populations ( McSorley and Maizels , 2012; Hotez et al . , 2008; Jourdan et al . , 2018; Jackson et al . , 2009 ) . This has limited our analysis of anti-parasite immune responses to imaging approaches , phenotypical observations in transgenic mouse strains or the assessment of secondary locations like the draining lymph nodes , blood or spleen ( McSorley and Maizels , 2012; Maizels and McSorley , 2016; Mishra et al . , 2014 ) , which might only partially reflect local immunity . As helminth infections are strongly linked to chronic impairments that affect nutrition availability ( Koski and Scott , 2001; Crompton and Nesheim , 2002 ) ; memory , cognition and physical development ( Ezeamama et al . , 2005; Pabalan et al . , 2018; Nokes et al . , 1992 ) ; changes in the microbiota ( Gause and Maizels , 2016; Ramanan et al . , 2016 ) and modulation of local and systemic immunity ( Mishra et al . , 2014; Maizels et al . , 2009 ) , an optimized digestion protocol is needed to further investigate the infected intestinal tissue . 
 Difficulties with intestinal digests during helminth infection have been associated with a strong anti-parasite type 2 immune response that drives mucus production ( Hashimoto et al . , 2009; von Moltke et al . , 2016 ) , alters the epithelium ( Gerbe et al . , 2016; Howitt et al . , 2016 ) , induces immune cell infiltration ( Inclan-Rico and Siracusa , 2018 ) and causes tissue remodelling ( Motran et al . , 2018; Boyett and Hsieh , 2014 ) ( Figure 1c ) . In order to investigate a model of both acute and chronic helminth infection , we infected C57BL/6 mice with Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri ( also known as Heligmosomoides bakeri; Behnke and Harris , 2010 ) , a naturally occurring rodent parasite with an exclusive intestinal life cycle ( Monroy and Enriquez , 1992; Reynolds et al . , 2012 ) . Infective L3 larvae penetrate the intestinal tissue of the duodenum within 24 hr of ingestion , undergo larval development in the muscularis externa and return to the lumen within 10 days post infection , where the adult worms mate and develop a chronic infection in C57BL/6 mice ( Reynolds et al . , 2012; Smith et al . , 2016 ) . The peak of acute immunity is usually studied around day 14 post infection and we focused on this time point and the heavily infected duodenum ( Filbey et al . , 2014; Elliott et al . , 2008 ) , to optimize our digestion protocol . In order to develop a digestion protocol for heavily infected intestines , we followed a systematic approach and optimized each step of the standard intestinal digestion protocol . First , we modified the EDTA wash steps to remove the increased amount of mucus but did not observe an improvement in cell yield ( Figure 1d and Figure 1—figure supplement 1; digestion protocols #1 , 2 , 6 ) . This was followed by testing a variety of collagenases that have been reported for intestinal digests , as we hypothesized that the intestinal remodeling that occurred during helminth infection could negatively impact the digestion procedure . Indeed , we found that Collagenase A from Clostridium histolyticum ( Figure 1d and Figure 1—figure supplement 1; digestion protocols #7 , 8 ) , but not Collagenase VIII , Collagenase D , Dispase or Liberase TM ( Figure 1d and Figure 1—figure supplement 1; digestion protocols #3–5 ) , showed an increase in cell yield when used in conjunction with the standard digestion protocol . To further optimize the protocol , we focused on Collagenase A-based digestion and increased and modified the wash steps and observed a further increase in cell yield ( Figure 1d and Figure 1—figure supplement 2; digestion protocols #9–12 ) . Importantly , strong vortexing after each wash step significantly improved the outcome of digestion ( Figure 1d and Figure 1—figure supplement 2; digestion protocol #13 ) , suggesting that the epithelium is harder to remove in helminth-infected tissues . Indeed , observations from Stat6ko mice confirmed that the physiological changes that impair the intestinal digest using the standard protocol , were all linked to type two immune responses , as intestines from infected Stat6ko mice could readily be digested ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3 ) . We also assessed intra-epithelial cells in the EDTA wash , but could not detect any CD45+ cells in preparations from infected animals , emphasizing that our protocol should only be used to isolate lamina propria cells . Several intestinal cell isolation protocols also utilize a final gradient centrifugation step to further isolate immune cells ( Weigmann et al . , 2007; Esterházy et al . , 2019 ) . However , in our hands this resulted in a dramatic drop in cell yield and was therefore omitted ( Figure 1d and Figure 1—figure supplement 2; digestion protocol #14 ) . Our optimized lamina propria cell isolation protocol for H . polygyrus-infected intestines thus included three 10 min 2 mM EDTA wash steps ( each followed by vigorous vortexing ) and a 30 min digest with 1 mg/ml Collagenase A , 20% FCS and 0 . 05 mg/ml DNase ( see Appendix 1 for step-by-step instructions ) . When we compared intestinal digests from naïve animals using the standard or optimized cell isolation protocol , we observed highly comparable outcomes ( Figure 1d; digestion protocols #1 and 13 ) . Both digestion protocols resulted in a cell yield of 3–6 million live cells per duodenum with 70–80% viability and 20–30% frequency of CD45+ cells . To assess the effectiveness of our digestion protocol during the different stages of H . polygyrus infection , we harvested the duodenum from naïve C57BL/6 mice and at day 7 , day 14 and day 28 of H . polygyrus infection , which represented time points of larval development in the muscularis externa , as well as acute and chronic adult worm infection , respectively . We observed that samples from all time points could be successfully digested using our optimized digestion protocol and that duodenal digests from 14- and 28 days post infection yielded 3–6 million live cells per sample ( Figure 1e , f ) . We furthermore observed a consistent doubling of the cell count to 8–11 million live cells per duodenum at day seven post infection and observed a similar trend when we quantified CD45+ cells in cryosections from these time points ( Figure 1f , g ) . To understand these differences and validate whether our protocol was suitable for subsequent single cell analysis and immunophenotyping , we characterized the isolated cells further using a 23-color spectral flow cytometry panel that incorporated many of the hallmark surface and intracellular markers for type two immune responses that have been associated with helminth infections ( Maizels and McSorley , 2016; Reynolds et al . , 2012 ) ( see Supplementary file 1 for details regarding markers , fluorophores , clones and staining concentrations used ) . Our staining panel was designed to identify both innate and adaptive immune cell populations and allowed us to assess eosinophils , neutrophils , different subsets of monocytes , macrophages and dendritic cells , as well as the three main populations of innate lymphoid cells ( ILC1 , ILC2 , and ILC3 ) and effector T cells populations ( Th1 , Th2 , Th17 ) , T regulatory cells and B cells as well as their proliferation through ki67 expression within the same panel . To guarantee optimal staining conditions , we tested our optimized digestion protocol on splenocytes and compared digested to non-digested cells , as collagenase digests can negatively affect surface epitope integrity . While we observed a reduction in the MFIs of several markers ( namely Ly6G , MHCII , CD45 and CD127 ) , all positive stained cell populations could be clearly identified ( Figure 1—figure supplement 4 ) . Isolated intestinal lamina propria cells also proved a challenge for intracellular staining , as different commercial intracellular staining kits significantly affected the cellular , but not debris , scatter profiles and varied in the resolution of intracellularly antibody staining ( Figure 1—figure supplement 5 ) . In our hands , the eBioscience FoxP3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set yielded the best results and was used henceforth . We isolated immune cells from the three main stages of H . polygyrus infection ( day 7 , day 14 and day 28 ) , representing larval development , as well as acute and chronic worm infection and used a combination of high-dimensional analysis tools and manual gating strategies to assess changes within each immune cell population ( Figure 2a and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . In line with previous findings ( Inclan-Rico and Siracusa , 2018 ) , we observed a strong infiltration of immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes at day 7 post infection , which we verified by confocal microscopy and were primarily localized around the developing larvae explaining the increase in total cell number at this timepoint ( Figure 2a–c and Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . At later time points this inflammatory response receded , which was likely linked to the worms exiting the intestinal tissue and inhabiting the lumen . Peak expression of RELMα in resident macrophages , which is a hallmark for their alternative activation and wound repair responses ( Esser-von Bieren et al . , 2013; Krljanac et al . , 2019 ) , was observed at day 14 and was again localized within the granulomas ( Figure 2b , c and Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . While type two innate lymphoid cells did not increase in frequency over time , ki67 expression increased , suggesting cell proliferation and activation ( Figure 2d ) , as previously described ( von Moltke et al . , 2016; Schneider et al . , 2018 ) . GATA3+ Th2 cells , important drivers of type two immunity ( Reynolds et al . , 2012; Mohrs et al . , 2005 ) , were detected throughout all stages of infection , increased in frequency over time and showed high ki67 expression ( Figure 2b ) . Interestingly , ki67 expression strongly decreased at day 28 post infection for all cell types analyzed ( Figure 2d and Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) , which could be linked to the strong immunomodulatory properties reported during chronic worm infection ( Maizels and McSorley , 2016; Grainger et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 2e ) . To validate that our cell isolation protocol resulted in an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses , we quantified B220+ , Siglec F+ , CD3+ CD4+ , CD3+ CD4- and CD64+ cells using confocal microscopy ( Figure 2—figure supplement 5a–c ) and compared their frequency to our spectral flow cytometry data . We observed that the frequencies of B220+ , CD3+ CD4+ , and CD64+ cells were highly comparable between confocal microscopy and spectral flow cytometry , while Siglec F+ cells were overrepresented in our spectral flow cytometry data and CD3+ CD4- cells were underrepresented . However , changes within immune cell populations at the peak of H . polygyrus infection were faithfully reported by both confocal microscopy and spectral flow cytometry ( Figure 2—figure supplement 5d ) , emphasizing that cell ratios defined by single cell analysis need to be carefully validated within the tissue before conclusions are drawn . Another important conclusion from our analysis was that the strong inflammatory immune responses that we had observed during H . polygyrus development in the muscularis externa , were specific to the infected tissue and were not observed to the same extent in the draining lymph nodes . Furthermore , ratios of ILC populations and T helper subsets were also strikingly different between the lamina propria and the draining lymph nodes at steady state , as were their proliferation kinetics and changes in proportion throughout the course of H . polygyrus infection ( Figure 2—figure supplement 6 and Figure 2—figure supplement 7 ) . To highlight the potential of our protocol for future studies that utilize current single-cell analysis tools , such as single cell RNA sequencing , we assessed the RNA quality of purified B cells , CD4 T cells and macrophages isolated from naïve or day 14 hr . polygyrus-infected mice ( Figure 2—figure supplement 8a , b ) . Our RNA quality analysis using the Agilent TapeStation resulted in high RIN numbers ( range 6 . 8–10 for naïve and 7 . 0–10 for day 14 hr . polygyrus samples ) ( Figure 2—figure supplement 8e ) . However , no clear separation of the 18S and 28S peaks could be observed on the gel image or the electropherograms ( Figure 2—figure supplement 8c , d ) . While the RIN numbers might not have been correctly calculated , and a technical optimization of the TapeStation protocol might be necessary , no RNA degradation was observed in naïve and day 14 hr . polygyrus samples , suggesting that the extraction of high-quality RNA is feasible from both naïve and day 14 hr . polygyrus-infected mice using our cell isolation protocol . Thus , our cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed us to characterize many known hallmarks of innate and adaptive anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection . We were able to validate these changes using confocal microscopy and while we could observe differences in the reported cell ratios , changes between naïve and infected samples were faithfully reported by both approaches . Importantly , many of these changes were only observed locally , highlighting the requirement for good cell isolation techniques to investigate intestinal responses against helminths directly . In addition to flow cytometric immunophenotyping , we were also able to extract high-quality RNA from cells isolated with our protocol , which could accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses through current single-cell analysis tools , such as single cell RNA sequencing , which has previously been unfeasible . 
 All animal experiments were carried out at the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research , were approved by the Victoria University of Wellington Animal Ethics Committee ( permit 24432 ) and carried out according to institutional guidelines . C57BL/6 and Stat6ko ( B6 . 129S2 ( C ) -Stat6tm1Gru/J ) mice were imported from The Jackson Laboratory and bred at the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research , Wellington , New Zealand . Mice were housed under specific pathogen free conditions and age-matched female adult animals were used in each experiment . The H . polygyrus life cycle was maintained as previously described ( Johnston et al . , 2015 ) . For experimental infections , mice were infected with 200 L3 larvae by oral gavage at 6–8 weeks of age and intestines and draining lymph nodes were harvested at the indicated time points . Adult worm burden was quantified by mounting opened intestines inside a 50 ml falcon filled with PBS . After 3 hr at 37°C , worms were collected from the bottom of the tube and counted under a microscope . Lamina propria cells were isolated from the first 8 cm of intestine according to isolation protocols described in this manuscript . Optimal digestion was achieved when intestinal segments were excised , cleaned and cut into small pieces . Samples were then washed with 2 mM EDTA/HBSS ( Gibco ) three times for 10 min at 37° C and 200 rpm in a shaking incubator , followed by three pulse vortexing steps at 2500 rpm ( maximum speed ) for 3 s after each incubation . After the final EDTA wash step , samples were digested in 10 ml RPMI ( Gibco ) containing 20% FBS ( Gibco ) , 1 mg/ml Collagenase A ( Roche #10103578001 , 0 . 223 U/mg solid ) and 0 . 05 mg/ml DNAse ( Roche #10104159001 , 2916 Kunitz units/mgL ) for 30 min at 37°C and 200 rpm in a shaking incubator , with vigorous manual shaking every 5 min . Digestion was quenched with FACS buffer and samples were passed through a 100 µm and 40 µm cell strainer to obtain a single cell suspension . An illustrated step-by-step protocol describing the procedure can be found in Appendix 1 . Individual duodenum draining mesenteric lymph nodes were identified as the most proximal lymph nodes of the mesenteric lymph node chain ( Esterházy et al . , 2019; Mayer et al . , 2017 ) , and were digested with 100 µg/mL Liberase TL and 100 µg/mL DNase I ( both from Roche , Germany ) for 30 min at 37°C and passed through a 70 µm cell strainer . For conventional flow cytometry cells were resuspended in 0 . 5 ml of 20 µg/ml DNase containing FACS buffer , stained with DAPI to identify dead cells , filtered and analyzed using a BD LSRFortessa SORP flow cytometer . For spectral flow cytometry , intestinal and lymph node samples were washed in 200 μL FACS buffer and incubated with Zombie NIR Fixable Viability dye ( Biolegend ) for 15 min at room temperature . After washing , cells were incubated with Fc block ( clone 2 . 4G2 , affinity purified from hybridoma culture supernatant ) for 10 min followed by the incubation of surface antibodies ( see Supplementary file 1 ) for 25 min at 4°C in the presence of 20 μg/ml DNase and Brilliant Buffer Plus ( BD Biosciences ) . Cells were fixed and permeabilized with the FoxP3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set ( eBioscience ) according to manufacturer’s instructions and incubated with intracellular antibodies ( see Supplementary file 1 ) for 45 min at 4°C . Cells were then resuspended in FACS buffer , filtered , and analyzed on a 3-laser Aurora spectral flow cytometer ( Cytek Biosciences ) . FCS files were manually analyzed using FlowJo ( v10 . 6 , Tree Star ) or evaluated with high-dimensional data analysis tools using Cytobank ( v7 . 2 , Cytobank Inc ) . After compensation correction in FlowJo , single , live , CD45+ events were imported into Cytobank and transformed to arcsinh scales . FlowSOM analysis was performed on 1 , 200 , 000 concatenated lamina propria and 1 , 000 , 000 concatenated lymph node cells , with an equal distribution of samples . Different cluster analyses were performed and 121 clusters were identified as the most representative for both data sets . For histological sections , 5 µm FFPE ( Formalin fixed paraffin embedded ) sections were stained using a standard H and E protocol ( Jacobson et al . , 2008 ) and visualized using a BX51 microscope ( Olympus ) equipped with a 10X NA 0 . 3 objective . For confocal microscopy , samples were processed and stained using a standard immunofluorescence protocol ( Schmidt et al . , 2019 ) . Briefly , 1 cm long pieces of intestine were fixed in 4% PFA for 1 hr , incubated in 20% sucrose overnight and rinsed in PBS . Samples were then snap-frozen in OCT compound ( Tissue-Tek ) using a Stand-Alone Gentle Jane Snap-freezing system ( Leica Biosystems ) . Cryosections of 7 µm were blocked with Fc Block ( clone 2 . 4G2 , affinity purified from hybridoma culture supernatant ) for 1 hr and stained with CD45-FITC ( clone 30-F11 , Biolegend ) , CD64-PE ( clone X54-5/7 . 1 , Biolegend ) , Ly6G-PECF594 ( clone 1A8 , Biolegend ) , RELMα-APC ( clone DSBRELM , eBioscience ) , B220-PECF594 ( clone RA3-6B2 , BD Biosciences ) , CD3-PE ( clone 145–2 C11 , eBioscience ) or CD4-APC ( clone RM4-5 , BD Biosciences ) for 1 hr . For nuclear staining , sections were incubated with DAPI ( 2 µg/ml ) for 10 min . Images were taken with an inverted IX 83 microscope equipped with a FV1200 confocal head ( Olympus ) using a 20X , N . A 0 . 75 objective . Images were acquired using the FV10-ASW software ( v4 . 2b , Olympus ) and analyzed with ImageJ ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) ( v1 . 52n ) . Image quantification analysis per field of view was performed using CellProfiler ( Lamprecht et al . , 2007 ) ( v3 . 1 . 8 ) and based on the spatial co-expression of immune cell markers and DAPI-positive nuclei . Cell quantification per villi section per mm ( Hwang et al . , 2018 ) was based on manual selection of the villi and electronic quantification of the area and positively stained cells . Single cell suspensions from naïve or day 14 hr . polygyrus-infected C57BL/6 mice were stained with CD45-BUV395 ( clone 30-F11 , BD Biosciences ) , CD64-Al647 ( clone X54-5/7 . 1 , Biolegend ) , MHCII-PE ( clone M5/114 . 15 . 2 , BD Biosciences ) , CD19-BB515 ( clone 1D3 , BD Biosciences ) , CD3-BV605 ( clone 17A2 , Biolegend ) , CD4-Pac Blue ( clone RM4-5 , BD Biosciences ) and DAPI . 700 , 000 CD45+ cells were sorted into FACS buffer using a BD Influx cell sorter ( BD Biosciences ) followed by purification of B cells , CD4 T cells and macrophages . 5 , 000 cells of each population were sorted into 100 µl RNA lysis buffer ( Zymo Research ) and stored at −80C . RNA was extracted using the Quick-RNA MicroPrep Kit ( Zymo Research ) and its quality assessed using the High Sensitivity RNA Screen Tape ( Agilent ) and a 4150 TapeStation System ( Agilent ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Experimental group sizes ranging from 3 to 5 animals were chosen to ensure that a two-fold difference between means could be detected with a power of at least 80% . Prism 6 Software ( GraphPad ) was used to calculate the s . e . m . and the statistical differences between groups and samples for each data set as detailed in the corresponding figure legends , with p≤0 . 05 being considered as significant .

Structures called proteasomes play a central part in this complex process by cutting up and digesting proteins . Mammals have several different types of proteasomes , each made up of several protein ‘subunits’ . For example , when a cell experiences inflammation some proteasomes change some of their subunits and form an immuno-proteasome . These immuno-proteasomes tend to break down proteins more quickly than ‘standard’ proteasomes , but it was not clear how they are able to do so . Liepe et al . have now combined experiments and mathematical modelling to construct a detailed model of proteasome activity . The model shows that protein transport into and out of the proteasome chamber are the steps that limit how quickly the proteasomes can break down proteins . Furthermore , these transport processes are also to a large extent responsible for the different rates at which standard and immuno-proteasomes process proteins . Liepe et al . were also able to confirm the existence of regulatory sites within the proteasome , and describe how these are arranged . Problems that alter the rate at which proteasomes break down proteins have been linked to tumors and neurological and autoimmune diseases . Liepe et al . 's model opens up the ability to study how the proteasome's activity is affected by drugs and therefore makes it easier to investigate ways of interfering with this activity for therapeutic purposes .","Proteasomal protein degradation is a key determinant of protein half-life and hence of cellular processes ranging from basic metabolism to a host of immunological processes . Despite its importance the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity are only incompletely understood . Here we use an iterative and tightly integrated experimental and modelling approach to develop , explore and validate mechanistic models of proteasomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics . The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its activity varies over time because of interactions between substrates and products and the proteolytic and regulatory sites; the locations of these sites and the interactions between them are predicted by the model , and experimentally supported . The analysis suggests that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of the substrates into the proteasome . The transport efficiency varies between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes thereby impinging upon total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage . 
 Cells can be usefully thought of as communities of molecular machines that work in concert to maintain cellular function ( Nurse , 2003 ) . Metabolism , gene expression , protein production and degradation , energy production , DNA replication , cell division all have their own repertoire of associated proteins and macromolecular assemblies , and are controlled by complex and highly dynamic signalling and regulatory networks; this picture is complemented by a slew of structural proteins that provide cell walls , nuclear membranes , endoplasmic reticulum and other structures of the eukaryotic cell . But while advances in imaging and microscopy technology have allowed us to glean some insights into the structures and even dynamics at the molecular level ( Liepe et al . , 2012 ) , much of our knowledge about the function of for example , protein production at ribosomes , or degradation at proteasomes , is based on indirect observations , or on data collected at some experimentally convenient equilibrium state . Increasingly time-resolved data can also be collected , and this type of data typically provides more detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms at work . To interpret such data , mathematical modelling coupled to state-of-the-art statistical inference thus becomes a necessity ( May 2004; Buchholz et al . , 2013; Gerlach et al . , 2013 ) to make sense of data and design better , more discriminatory experiments . Here we apply a modelling approach to a detailed mechanistic analysis of proteasomes , which are at the core of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and responsible for the destruction of the majority of the cytoplasmic proteins . Proteins are usually tagged by E1-E2-E3-E4 enzyme-mediated poly-ubiquitination , carried into the proteasome proteolytic chamber where they are fragmented and , ultimately , expulsed ( Schwartz and Ciechanover , 2009 ) . Proteins , and especially oxidised proteins—that is , those that reflect the presence of cellular stress conditions—can also be degraded by 20S proteasomes without prior poly-ubiquitination ( Aiken et al . , 2011; Pickering and Davies , 2012; Ben-Nissan and Sharon , 2014; Höhn and Grune , 2014 ) . In addition to stress response , the 20S proteasomes present in cells ( Fabre et al . , 2015 ) have been shown to regulate the abundance of a host of signalling molecules involved in cell cycle progression , cellular growth control and oncogenesis ( Ben-Nissan and Sharon , 2014 ) . Additionally , 20S proteasomes form the core of the structure of 26S proteasomes and we cannot expect to understand the latter if we do not understand the mechanisms that determine the activity of the former . Poly-ubiquitin tagging ( when it occurs ) , transport and peptide-bond hydrolysis regulate protein half-life and thereby affect the majority of metabolic processes in the cell . Despite considerable biochemical and structural efforts , the mechanisms of proteasomal action , in particular the causes and extent of differences in substrate-specific proteolysis between different proteasome isoforms , are only incompletely understood . In this study we combine carefully designed experimental assays with detailed modelling to shed light on these mechanisms . There is a dearth of mechanistic analyses of proteasome functions , and the complexity of polypeptide hydrolysis has precluded detailed analysis ( Liepe et al . , 2014a ) . The most direct insights come from carefully chosen short fluorogenic peptides , which have a single proteasome-catalyzed cleavage site , which in turn allows us to follow the kinetics in real time . They have also been used ( exclusively ) to measure the proteasomal activity in cellulo ( e . g . , Kapeta et al . , 2010; Chondrogianni et al . , 2015; Peters et al . , 2015; Pickering et al . , 2015 ) , despite the fact that they lack the complexity of ‘real’ proteins and they do not recapitulate proteasome proteolytic activities towards polypeptide chains ( Mishto et al . , 2014 ) . Nevertheless , they provide arguably the most promising class of leads of proteasomal inhibitors ( Bellavista et al . , 2013; Kisselev and Groettrup , 2014 ) . Furthermore , kinetic and structural analyses rely on their structural and biophysical characteristics ( Gaczynska et al . , 1993; Kisselev et al . , 2002 , 2003 , 2006; Osmulski et al . , 2009 ) ; we , too , use them here for our analysis , which is based on a representative set of such peptides . As we show below the insights gained from the short fluorogenic peptides are borne out by further analysis of polypeptides . The mechanistic analyses performed here also incorporate known structural features into a mathematical model of proteasome action . The 20S proteasome consists of four stacked seven membered rings ( denoted by α7β7β7α7 ) . These rings form three interconnected cavities , including a pair of antechambers through which substrates are passed before reaching the central catalytic chamber . Antechamber walls are not merely structural , but interact actively with the substrates by altering their properties and keeping them accessible for hydrolysis ( Ruschak et al . , 2010 ) . These proteasome chambers can also store two or more proteins in order to enable continuous degradation ( Hutschenreiter et al . , 2004; Sharon et al . , 2006 ) . The central chamber contains six subunits ( two β1 , β2 and β5 subunits ) that catalyse the peptide-bond hydrolysis and peptide splicing after binding of the polypeptide substrates nearby their active N-terminal Thr ( Vigneron et al . , 2004; Borissenko and Groll , 2007; Mishto et al . , 2012 ) . 20S proteasomes modify their conformations and thus in turn their activity upon peptide-bond hydrolysis ( Osmulski et al . , 2009; Ruschak and Kay , 2012 ) , binding of regulatory complexes such as 11S or 19S to the proteasome α rings ( leading to the formation of PA28-capped proteasomes and 26S proteasomes , respectively ) ( Dick et al . , 1996; Emmerich et al . , 2000; Köhler et al . , 2001; Ruschak and Kay , 2012; Raule et al . , 2014 ) , and activation of non-catalytic modifier sites ( Schmidtke et al . , 2000; Kisselev et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) whose location in the proteasome remain unknown ( Liepe et al . , 2014a ) . In mammals different 20S proteasome isoforms exist , which carry different catalytic β subunits . Upon an inflammatory stimulus such as IFN-γ the catalytic standard β1 , β2 and β5 subunits peculiar of the standard proteasome ( s-proteasome ) are replaced by the immuno-subunits β1i , β2i and β5i in the newly synthesized immunoproteasome ( i-proteasome ) . Proteasome isoforms degrade substrates with different rates , but generate the same peptide pool ( Mishto et al . , 2014 ) . And while there exist differences between substrates , the 20S i-proteasome has been shown often to have a higher polypeptide degradation rate than its standard counterpart ( Bellavista et al . , 2013 ) . Why s- or i-proteasomes should degrade specific substrates more rapidly is a matter of ongoing debate . Different steps of the proteolysis process may be responsible for isoform specific kinetics: transport of the substrate through the gate and the antechambers; binding to substrate binding sites and ensuing peptide-bond hydrolysis ( Huber et al . , 2012; Arciniega et al . , 2014 ) ; and the release from the substrate binding sites and finally from the proteasome gate . The question is also of direct medical relevance: different degradation kinetics of specific substrates by s- and i-proteasomes , or i-proteasome carrying genetic polymorphisms/mutations , have been suggested to be involved in a variety of pathologies ( Basler et al . , 2013; Bellavista et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , i-proteasome deficient mice show altered proteasome-dependent kinetics of pathogen epitope generation ( Basler et al . , 2013 ) . Such different kinetics could , for example , lead to the remodelling of immunodominance of viral epitopes ( Zanker et al . , 2013 ) or to the lack of CD8+ T cell-mediated response towards specific viral antigens ( Deol et al . , 2007 ) . As we will show below , our framework allows us to start from simple models of proteasome function , and identify which mechanistic shortcomings they exhibit . We focus on the dynamics of the digestion of a set of exemplar peptides , and show that this process is regulated carefully and by three distinct mechanisms , that act in concert to regulate proteasomal activity . Here considering different mechanisms , coupled to state-of-the art statistical model selection techniques ( Kirk et al . , 2013 ) , allows us to elucidate steps in the proteasomal dynamics that cannot be probed directly through experiments . Model selection naturally extends the conventional hypothesis testing approach , and by accounting for uncertainty fairly and correctly , can be applied to systems with many unknown kinetic parameters ( which are , in any case , inferred together with their respective uncertainties ) ( Liepe et al . , 2013; Babtie et al . , 2014 ) . 
 Using tightly integrated experimental and computational modelling analyses , recent advances in our understanding of proteasome structure and function , and previous attempts at modelling proteasome dynamics ( Liepe et al . , 2014a ) , we elaborate the first comprehensive mathematical model that is able to describe the regulatory components of 20S proteasomes; and the complex interactions between substrate/product transport and substrate hydrolysis over time for representative peptides . Modelling helps us to understand how the 20S proteasome catalyzes the degradation of specific proteins in cells ( Pickering and Davies , 2012; Ben-Nissan and Sharon , 2014; Höhn and Grune , 2014; Fabre et al . , 2015 ) ; it also forms the basis for future studies of the main active forms of proteasome in cells , for example , when it is bound to the regulatory complexes 19S and PA28 ( Fabre et al . , 2015 ) . Indeed , in 19S or PA28 single-capped proteasomes all steps considered in our model are still present , including the regulation of the gate by non-catalytic modifier site ( s ) and the gate binding affinity since one of the proteasome gates is not bound to the regulatory complexes and will therefore be regulated as described here . We observe similar proteasome dynamics over time when using purified 20S proteasome as well as protein homogenates , where 20S proteasomes are surrounded by several regulatory molecules . It suggests that with the present model we describe a core of proteasome features that could reflect proteasome dynamics also in more complex scenarios such as might exist inside the cellular environment . Our model therefore also provides an interpretative framework for general studies of proteasome action , keeping in mind that substrate-specific effects need to be accounted for ( Mishto et al . , 2014 ) . Simple ( e . g . , MM-type ) models , which have been largely used in analysing proteasome functionality so far , are clearly not capable of describing proteasome dynamics; this is becoming apparent since time-course data is much less forgiving and harder to fit to than for example , dose-response curves . The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its catalytic activity varies over time in a way that can only be understood if the structural characteristics of the proteasome are taken into account . Kinetics change over longer time scales than the structural dynamics described by Osmulski et al . ( 2009 ) and they are influenced by the interactions of substrates and products with both proteolytic and regulatory sites . Our analysis suggests that the cavity of 20S proteasomes is progressively filled by peptides that can further facilitate other molecules to enter the chambers until the effective cavity volume has been almost completely filled . In fact , the estimated numbers of substrate and product molecules ( C ) that are inside the proteasome cavity are close to the possible maxima ( Box 2 ) . Peptide accumulation over time leads to activation of non-catalytic modifier sites , which our analysis shows to be located inside the proteasome cavity . 10 . 7554/eLife . 07545 . 025Box 2 . Filling kinetics of the proteasome inner cavity over time . A key part of the peptide transport dynamics is the maximum capacity ( C ) of the two proteasome ante-chambers and the main chamber . C describes the maximal number of molecules of a given substrate can be allocated inside the proteasome chamber at the same time . C is dependent on the volume of the proteasome chamber and on the volume of the substrate molecules . For this reason C is expected to be substrate specific . The model estimates of C for the three tested substrates are in agreement with values predicted by computing the maximal number of substrates that could be located inside the proteasome chamber . The estimated volumes for Suc-LLVY-MCA , Z-LLE-MCA and Bz-VGR-MCA are approx . 936 A3 , 741 A3 and 606 A3 , respectively ( with an MCA group of 200 A3 ) . This results in a ratio of 1 . 25 for Suc-LLVY-MCA:Z-LLE-MCA ( model estimate: 1 . 24 ) , 1 . 36 for Suc-LLVY-MCA:Bz-VGR-MCA ( model estimate: 1 . 46 ) and 1 . 08 for Z-LLE-MCA:Bz-VGR-MCA ( model estimate: 1 . 12 ) . The exact number of molecules inside the chamber depends on the maximum possible density , but is approximately estimated to be 250 , 310 and 337 for Suc-LLVY-MCA , Z-LLE-MCA and Bz- VGR-MCA , respectively , which is in the same order of magnitude as the model estimates ( 200 , 249 and 293 ) . Note , computed values are the maximal possible amount of molecules that could be packed inside the chamber . However , under physiological conditions the actual number of molecules that can be filled in the proteasome cavity has to be smaller , which is reflected in our model estimates . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 07545 . 025 Substrate transport through the gate and cavities must therefore be a key factor in the regulation of the proteolytic process , despite the fact that it had been largely neglected so far in the quantitative analysis of proteasome dynamics ( Liepe et al . , 2014a ) . The integration of data into our mathematical model clearly shows that peptide transport is the major rate limiting step in the degradation of short fluorogenic substrates: all models/hypotheses that do not account for this are soundly rejected . Hydrolysis is only rate limiting for the degradation of Z-LLE-MCA . We stress that for the short fluorogenic substrates the rate limiting steps are conserved across the different proteasomes ( mouse proteasome and human s- and i-proteasomes ) . This in turn suggests that the interspecies homology of the proteasome structure results in preserving transport characteristics , although subtle structural variations can quantitatively modify the transport , as observed by comparing s- and i-proteasomes . Variation of the transport efficiency typically leads to quantitative changes in the degradation rates of short fluorogenic substrates . For more complex substrates , for example , polypeptides , transport variation could change substrate cleavage-site usage and thus result in the generation of specific peptide products . If these peptides are MHC class I-restricted epitopes , substantial variations in their amount could strongly affect the cell-mediated immune response . Indeed , as we have recently shown , significant decreases of antigenic peptide amount produced by proteasome could lead to a presentation onto the MHC class I molecules that is so diminished to be not able to trigger CD8+ T cell activation ( Mishto et al . , 2014 ) . According to our model , modifications of the proteasome gate upon PA28 binding will for instance affect the substrate cleavage-site usage and lead to the observed alterations of MHC class I-restricted epitope repertoire ( Cascio , 2014 ) . Differences in gate and inner channel features are in part responsible for the different degradation rates of the short fluorogenic peptides by human s- and i-proteasomes although they diverge also in the activity of the catalytic subunits themselves . Differences in the gate between the two proteasome isoforms are supported also by Fabre et al . ( 2015 ) , who identified preferential binding between the α subunits of s- and i-proteasomes and specific regulatory complexes . Such differences can become dominant driving forces . For instance , the degradation of the substrate Bz-VGR-MCA is not influenced by differences in the active site-related parameters—as is correctly predicted by our model . This also agrees with comparisons of the crystallographic structures of the mouse s- and i-proteasomes , which identify only minor variations between the β2 and β2i catalytic pockets ( Huber et al . , 2012 ) . By contrast , the catalytic sites of s-proteasome have stronger binding affinity for the substrate Z-LLE-MCA than the i-proteasome , which could be explained by the structural differences between β1 and β1i catalytic pockets described by Huber et al . ( 2012 ) . For the degradation of the substrate Suc-LLVY-MCA our model predicts that the i-proteasome has higher substrate-binding affinity , higher hydrolysis rate , and lower cooperativity than the s-proteasome . This prediction is corroborated by the recent study of Arciniega et al . ( 2014 ) , who showed that the β5i pocket is more prone to bind and process substrates than the β5 pocket; however , only s-proteasome is able to modify its conformation upon substrate binding to the β5 subunit ( Arciniega et al . , 2014 ) , which is also correctly captured by our model as increased cooperativity ( ni ) . The outcomes of our integrative analysis suggest that the i-proteasome also has a higher affinity for the enhancing non-catalytic modifier site activated by all three substrates; given that our model consistently predicts this site to be located at the inner surface , it should now become possible to determine the precise location of the enhancer site using structural techniques . Our model is a necessary and non-trivial step towards understanding protein degradation by proteasomes . A full-length protein is a much more complicated substrate and it can interact with the different regulatory and catalytic sites in a myriad of ways . In any such analysis , however , the model developed here can aid the experimental set-up ( Liepe et al . , 2013; Sunnaker et al . , 2013 ) and the interpretation of experimental data . What is already clear is that the complex interactions between a suitable complicated substrate and the proteasomal machinery will substantially shape differences in degradation rates between proteins; as the protein degradation rate is known to influence for example , noise in signal transduction , a way to understand and rationally interfere with this process is of obvious importance .

Mutations in the genes that encode CFTR may reduce the number of pores at the cell surface or stop them from working properly . When this happens , these cells cannot transport enough chloride , which causes the disease cystic fibrosis . CFTR contains two regions that lie inside the cell known as nucleotide binding domains ( NBDs ) . These domains bind to the chemical energy molecule ATP , and when ATP does bind , two NBDs associate to form a dimer and the pore in CFTR opens . The CFTR channel can occasionally open in a spontaneous way that does not require ATP . However , it was not clear whether NBDs also formed dimers when CFTR opened in this way . This is because spontaneous opening could reflect NBDs occasionally forming a dimer without ATP binding or it could occur when the pore occasionally opens without the NBDs forming a dimer . To explore whether opening of the pore always requires NBD dimerization , Mihályi et al . studied the behaviour of single human CFTR channels produced in frog eggs . Normal channels and mutant ones ( which show differences in spontaneous opening ) were used , and the change in the way NBDs interacted when the channels spontaneously opened or closed was investigated . Mihályi et al . found that the NBD dimer forms when the pore spontaneously opens , demonstrating that this step happens both with and without ATP . The result demonstrates that NBD dimer formation and pore movement are strictly coupled and that this is an inbuilt property of the CFTR protein . When ATP binds , this only changes how stable the open-pore and closed-pore structures of CFTR are but does not alter the fundamental architecture of the channel . These new findings will be of interest to researchers studying a large group of transport proteins related to CFTR called ABC proteins . Furthermore , a drug called ivacaftor stimulates spontaneous opening of CFTR , and has recently been approved for clinical use to treat people with mutations in CFTR . As such , the new findings will be also useful to help researchers understand how ivacaftor stimulates the CFTR pore to open .","In CFTR , the chloride channel mutated in cystic fibrosis ( CF ) patients , ATP-binding-induced dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains ( NBDs ) opens the pore , and dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis closes it . Spontaneous openings without ATP are rare in wild-type CFTR , but in certain CF mutants constitute the only gating mechanism , stimulated by ivacaftor , a clinically approved CFTR potentiator . The molecular motions underlying spontaneous gating are unclear . Here we correlate energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CFTR channels . We show that spontaneous openings are also strictly coupled to NBD dimerization , which may therefore occur even without ATP . Coordinated NBD/pore movements are therefore intrinsic to CFTR: ATP alters the stability , but not the fundamental structural architecture , of open- and closed-pore conformations . This explains correlated effects of phosphorylation , mutations , and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity , providing insights for understanding CF mutation and drug mechanisms . 
 The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) is a chloride ion channel which belongs to the superfamily of ATP binding cassette ( ABC ) proteins ( Riordan et al . , 1989 ) . Following phosphorylation of the cytosolic regulatory ( R ) domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKA ) , CFTR channels are gated by cytosolic ATP ( Figure 1a ) . The ion pore within the TMDs opens upon formation of a tight head-to-tail NBD dimer stabilized by two molecules of ATP occluded at the dimer interface ( Vergani et al . , 2005 ) ; each nucleotide is sandwiched between the conserved Walker A and B sequences of one NBD and the signature sequence of the other ( Smith et al . , 2002; Chen et al . , 2003 ) . Pore closure accompanies NBD dimer disruption prompted by ATP hydrolysis at the composite interfacial site harbouring the Walker motifs of NBD2 ( site 2 ) ( Vergani et al . , 2005 ) : the other site ( site 1 ) is catalytically inactive retaining ATP bound throughout multiple gating cycles ( Aleksandrov et al . , 2002; Basso et al . , 2003 ) . As evidence of such strict coupling between NBD and transmembrane domain ( TMD ) movements , a hydrogen bond between the side chains of NBD2 Walker-A threonine ( T1246 ) and an arginine ( R555 ) adjacent to the NBD1 signature sequence was shown to form in open , but not in closed , channels ( Vergani et al . , 2005 ) . These two positions have co-evolved as a pair ( Vergani et al . , 2005 ) , and in crystal structures of nucleotide-bound ABC NBD dimers the analogous side chains also form a hydrogen bond , the arginine serving as hydrogen donor and the threonine/serine side chain as acceptor ( Smith et al . , 2002; Chen et al . , 2003 ) . Furthermore , by disturbing proper spacing between the donor and acceptor sites , both shortening of the R555 and lengthening of the T1246 side chains ( by single mutations R555K and T1246N , respectively ) prevent , whereas the double mutation R555K-T1246N restores , the formation of this stabilizing hydrogen bond ( Vergani et al . , 2005 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18164 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18164 . 005 Wild-type ( WT ) CFTR channels open occasionally even in the absence of ATP ( Szollosi et al . , 2010 ) ( Figure 1a , inset ) , but it is unclear whether this reflects the occasional spontaneous formation of the NBD dimer ( Figure 1b , top ) , or occasional pore openings independent of NBD dimerization ( Figure 1b , bottom ) . The significance of this question goes beyond the scarcity of WT spontaneous openings . Indeed , the strictness of coupling between NBD and TMD movements is a strongly debated fundamental question , key for understanding the forces that drive the normal , ATP-dependent functional cycle of ABC proteins ( Vergani et al . , 2005; Csanády et al . , 2010; Kirk and Wang , 2011; Jih and Hwang , 2013; Okeyo et al . , 2013 ) . Moreover , ivacaftor , the only potentiator drug to be approved so far for clinical use in CF patients , acts by promoting such spontaneous , ATP-independent , openings of G551D CFTR , the third most common disease mutant ( Bompadre et al . , 2007; Jih et al . , 2013 ) . However , mechanistic understanding of spontaneous gating has been limited by its vanishingly small open probability ( Po ) , far too low to be reliably quantified ( Figure 1a ) . Recently , mutations in the third intracellular loop ( position 978 , between TM helices 8 and 9 ) ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) , and at the cytosolic end of pore-lining TM helix 6 ( position 355 ) ( Wei et al . , 2014 ) , were both found to strongly enhance spontaneous activity . Furthermore , these 'gain-of-function' effects proved additive in the double-mutant P355A–K978C , shifting spontaneous Po into a range where quantitative biophysical studies become tractable ( Wei et al . , 2014 ) . Here we exploit this double mutant as a background to address the mechanism of spontaneous openings . 
 Whereas WT CFTR channel currents decline rapidly to baseline upon ATP removal ( Figure 1a ) , in patches containing P355A-K978C CFTR channels ( Figure 1c ) a readily measurable fraction of the chloride current resisted even prolonged removal of bath ATP , but could be abolished by removal of permeating chloride ions ( red bars; see also Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Moreover , for WT CFTR , ATP-dependent currents are very small prior to exposure to PKA , and decline by ~50% when PKA is withdrawn ( Figure 1a ) , signalling strong phosphorylation dependence of its Po ( Szollosi et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , ATP-evoked P355A-K978C CFTR currents were large already before exposure to PKA , and were little further enhanced by the addition of – or reduced following removal of – the kinase ( Figure 1c ) , suggesting a large Po for unphosphorylated ( pre-PKA ) double-mutant channels in ATP , and close-to-maximal Po when the channels were either fully phosphorylated ( in PKA ) or partially dephosphorylated ( post-PKA ) . The robust spontaneous activity of P355A-K978C channels in the absence of ATP allowed reliable sampling of the characteristics of spontaneous gating in microscopic patches ( Figure 2a ) , in which the number of active channels could be confidently estimated from bracketing high-Po segments of recordings in ATP ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . Thus , for pre-phosphorylated channels the P355A-K978C background mutation increased spontaneous Po from 0 . 000053 ± 0 . 000021 ( n = 5 ) to 0 . 15 ± 0 . 03 ( n = 21 ) ( Figure 1d , WT vs . BG [background] ) , and Po in ATP from 0 . 11 ± 0 . 04 ( n = 6 ) to 0 . 80 ± 0 . 02 ( n = 14 ) ( Figure 1d , striped bars ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18164 . 006Figure 2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 18164 . 006 This double-mutant CFTR background allowed us to study , using the thermodynamic double mutant cycle formalism ( Materials and methods ) , changes in energetic coupling associated with spontaneous gating between the same two NBD-interface side chains previously used ( Vergani et al . , 2005 ) to demonstrate NBD dimer formation and disruption in CFTR channels opening and closing in ATP . Mutating either the arginine at position 555 to a lysine , or the threonine at position 1246 to an asparagine , resulted in a large reduction in spontaneous Po ( Figure 2b–c 0 . 034 ± 0 . 007 ( n = 18 ) and 0 . 044 ± 0 . 009 ( n = 19 ) , respectively , Figure 2e , blue and red bar ) , that is , in the closed-open equilibrium constant in the absence of ATP . This reduction in the stability of the open ( O ) state relative to the closed ( C ) state ( ΔΔG ( O−C ) ∘ = +1 . 82 ± 0 . 39 kT and +1 . 54 ± 0 . 39 kT , respectively , in R555K and T1246N single mutants; Figure 2h , numbers on top-across , and left-downward , arrows of the mutant cycle ) is due to the loss in both single mutants of microscopic interactions , between the targeted side chain and the rest of the protein , that in WT channels combine to increase the stability of the open state . If the side chains of residues R555 and T1246 did not interact in WT CFTR , or if their interaction were to remain unaltered during spontaneous gating , then any impact on the spontaneous channel activity of mutating either single position should be independent of the nature of the side chain found at the other position: that is , mutational effects at the two positions should add energetically . Any non-additive behaviour would signal gating-associated dynamic changes in the interaction energy between the R555 and T1246 side chains . In stark contrast to the single mutants , the double mutant R555K-T1246N ( Figure 2d ) displayed a high spontaneous Po ( 0 . 11 ± 0 . 02 ( n = 20 ) ; Figure 2e , violet bar ) , comparable to that of the background construct . Thus , the effects on the spontaneous Po of either single mutation depended strongly on the nature of the residue at the other position: the spontaneous open-channel state was destabilized relative to the closed-channel state when the R555K mutation was introduced into a WT background ( blue vs . black bar in Figure 2e ) , but was stabilized when the same mutation was introduced into a T1246N background ( violet vs . red bar in Figure 2e ) . The difference between ΔΔG ( O−C ) ∘ along two parallel sides of the mutant cycle quantifies the change in interaction strength between the two target side chains that accompanies a spontaneous pore opening ( ΔΔGint ( O−C ) ; see Materials and methods ) , and revealed a significant ( p = 0 . 0004 ) change of –2 . 90 ± 0 . 49 kT ( Figure 2h , center ) in R555-T1246 interaction energy between ATP-free closed- and open-channel states . In principle , the negative sign of ΔΔGint ( O−C ) is compatible with the existence of either a stabilizing interaction in the spontaneously formed open-channel state , or a destabilizing interaction in the closed state . However , earlier work reported a lack of interaction between the R555 and T1246 side chains in closed channels , regardless of the presence of ATP in site 2 ( Vergani et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , the only plausible explanation is a stabilizing interaction , consistent with the formation of a hydrogen bond , in the spontaneous open state in WT channels that is lost in both single mutants , but is restored in the double mutant . The inevitable implication of these findings is that the NBD dimer interface must tighten within site 2 upon pore opening , whether or not bound ATP is present . Conformational transitions between stable open-channel ( burst ) and closed-channel ( interburst ) states of CFTR reflect passages across the transition ( T‡ ) state ( Figure 3a ) , a high free-energy transient conformation . The rates of spontaneous opening and closure of each molecular channel type , obtained as the inverse of the mean interburst ( τib ) and burst ( τb ) durations , respectively , report on transition-state stability: mutation-induced fractional changes in spontaneous opening and closing rates quantitate changes in transition-state free energy relative to the closed ( ΔΔG ( T−C ) ∘ ) and open ( ΔΔG ( T−O ) ∘ ) ground states , respectively . Specifically , the difference between such ΔΔG∘ values along two parallel sides of a mutant cycle quantify the changes in coupling strength between the two target side chains upon reaching the transition state during opening ( ΔΔGint ( T−C ) , Figure 2i ) or closure ( ΔΔGint ( T−O ) , Figure 2j ) . Kinetic analysis revealed that the reduced spontaneous open probabilities of both single mutants R555K and T1246N ( Figure 2e , blue and red bar ) were caused predominantly by a markedly reduced opening rate ( Figure 2f , blue and red bar ) , which was restored in the double mutant ( Figure 2f , violet bar ) . Consequently , a significant ( p = 0 . 0001 ) negative value of –2 . 30 ± 0 . 46 kT ( Figure 2i , center ) was obtained for the change in coupling free energy between the target side chains upon reaching the transition state from the closed state ( ΔΔGint ( T−C ) ) . In contrast , closing rates were little affected by the mutations ( Figure 2g ) , yielding a value of +0 . 62 ± 0 . 34 kT for ΔΔGint ( T−O ) , not significantly different from zero ( Figure 2j , center ) . These results imply that in WT channels the hydrogen bond between the R555 and T1246 side chains is already formed in the transition state for spontaneous opening , its strength being little further altered when the protein reaches the stable open state ( Figure 3b ) . Thus , the NBD dimer interface tightens within site 2 already in the transition state for unliganded opening ( Figure 3a , center ) , just as it does during the opening of ATP-bound channels ( Vergani et al . , 2005; Sorum et al . , 2015 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 18164 . 007Figure 3 .

 While ATP-driven CFTR pore openings are known to be coupled to the formation of a tight NBD dimer ( Vergani et al . , 2005 ) , the mechanism of spontaneous openings , observable in the absence of ATP , is unknown . Here we show that spontaneous openings are also linked to tightening of the NBD interface around composite site 2 , just as in the presence of bound ATP . Such strict coupling between NBD and pore movements – regardless of the absence or presence of ATP – strongly constrains mechanistic models of ATP-dependent channel gating , and understanding of the underlying driving forces , which are likely conserved among ABC proteins . It also helps explain modulatory effects of mutations , or of physiological or pharmacological gating regulators . For example , the G551D CF mutation converts ATP at site 2 into an inhibitory ligand , due to electrostatic repulsion between the γ-phosphate of ATP bound to the Walker motifs , and the introduced negative charge in the signature sequence ( Lin et al . , 2014 ) . Such an effect would not be expected if the opposing NBD interfaces did not approach each other in the open-channel state , but is readily explained by openings being strictly linked to NBD dimer formation even in the G551D mutant . Furthermore , although reported low-probability ATP-independent pore openings of a CFTR construct lacking NBD2 ( CFTR residues 1–1197; [Wang et al . , 2007] ) can clearly not be linked to NBD dimer formation , the present results argue that upon pore opening its remaining NBD-TMD coupling machinery undergoes movements similar to those that accompany NBD dimerization when neither 'limb' is truncated . Because of the tightened NBD interface , the ATP binding sites of open CFTR channels are likely inaccessible to the bulk solution even in the absence of bound ATP , just as in its presence ( Chaves and Gadsby , 2015 ) , suggesting that ATP binding/unbinding can take place only in the closed-channel state . Two immediate corollaries ensue . First , the ATP-free open-channel state is unlikely to be an integral component of the ATP-dependent gating cycle ( Szollosi et al . , 2010; but , cf . Jih et al . , 2013 ) . Second , despite suggested similarities ( Wang et al . , 2010; Kirk et al . , 2011; Okeyo et al . , 2013 ) , the principles that drive gating of CFTR channels are fundamentally different from those of ligand-gated channels , such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor . Ligand-gated channels obey cyclic equilibrium mechanisms in which ligand binding/unbinding can occur both in the closed- and the open-channel state , and the activating effect of the ligand is based on the thermodynamic principle of detailed balance which constrains the product of the equilibrium constants around a cycle to be unity: thus , opening ( 'isomerization' ) is driven by the concurrent conformational change of the ligand binding site which increases its affinity for the ligand ( Grosman and Auerbach , 2001 ) . But in CFTR the ligand binding site is occluded in open channels , so that an open-state 'binding affinity' cannot be defined ( the rates for both ATP binding and unbinding are zero ) . Thus , even when disruption of ATP hydrolysis forces CFTR channels to gate at equilibrium , that gating follows a reversible linear sequence ( cf . , Figure 3a ) , rather than a cycle subject to the principle of detailed balance . Strong correlation between effects on unliganded and liganded channel activity , and energetic additivity of such effects , has been reported for a range of diverse 'allosteric modulators' acting on various regions of the channel . For instance , both unliganded and liganded Po is increased in a physiological context by R-domain phosphorylation , presumably by altering R-domain interactions with the TMDs ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) , or in a therapeutic context by the CF drug ivacaftor , believed to target the TMDs ( Jih et al . , 2013 ) . Further , distinct mutations in intracellular loops increase ( Wang et al . , 2010; Wei et al . , 2014 ) or decrease ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) Po for both unliganded and liganded CFTR . The present results suggest a simple , unified explanation for all these findings: energetic stabilization or destabilization of the inherent open-channel-state structure ( Figure 3a , right ) , which we show here is similarly organized in the absence or presence of ATP . Comparison of gating parameters for WT CFTR and our background mutant reveals the mechanism by which gain-of-function mutations promote spontaneous activity ( Figure 3c , black vs . orange free energy profiles ) . The increase in spontaneous Po by the P355A-K978C double mutation ( Figure 1d , BG vs . WT ) amounts to a stabilization of the spontaneous open state by ~8 . 1 kT ( Figure 3c , right black arrow ) , and is due not only to an increased frequency of openings but also to a slower rate of closure , because spontaneous τb is substantially prolonged ( from 60 ± 9 ms ( n = 5 ) to 1566 ± 235 ms ( n = 19 ) ) , suggesting an increase in ΔΔG ( T−O ) ∘ of ~3 . 3 kT relative to WT . Together , these data imply that these gain-of-function mutations stabilize the transition state by far less ( only by ~4 . 8 kT; Figure 3c , left black arrow ) than the open state , as expected for perturbations that affect protein positions which have not yet reached their fully open-like conformations in the transition state . This is consistent with a similar finding for an NBD-TMD interface position during ATP-dependent opening ( Sorum et al . , 2015 ) . Thus , just as for ATP-bound channels , the pore is likely still closed in the high-energy evanescent transition state for spontaneous openings ( Figure 3a , center cartoon ) . Finally , what can we infer about the mechanism by which binding of the natural ligand ATP promotes CFTR channel opening ? The presence of bound ATP does not alter the global arrangement of conformations: rather ATP acts as a 'molecular glue' to stabilize the transition state and the open state . Because ATP-induced openings are terminated by ATP hydrolysis ( Csanády et al . , 2010 ) , energetic interpretation of ATP-binding induced gating effects cannot be based on the comparison of WT gating in the presence and absence of ATP ( Figure 1d , WT+ATP vs . WT ) . However , comparing gating parameters for spontaneous activity of WT CFTR and ATP-driven activity of hydrolysis-incompetent mutant CFTR channels offers some insight into the impact of ATP binding on gating energetics ( Figure 3c , gray vs . orange free energy profiles ) . Mutations that disrupt ATP hydrolysis in site 2 all prolong τb and reduce CFTR gating to an equilibrium , by forcing the channels to close back through the same high-energy transition state they had traversed upon opening ( cf . Figure 3a ) ( Vergani et al . , 2005; Csanády et al . , 2010; Sorum et al . , 2015 ) . For instance , comparison of Po and τb of the site 2 Walker-A mutant K1250R CFTR in saturating ATP ( Po ~ 0 . 6 , τb = 9323 ms [Vergani et al . , 2005] ) with those of spontaneously gating WT CFTR suggests that the presence of bound ATP stabilizes the open-channel state by ~10 . 3 kT ( Figure 3c , right gray arrow ) and increases ΔΔG ( T−O ) ∘ by ~5 . 1 kT , respectively , which implies that bound ATP stabilizes the transition state by only ~5 . 2 kT ( Figure 3c , left gray arrow ) . Thus , intriguingly , although the NBD interface is already tightened within site 2 in the ATP-bound transition state ( Vergani et al . , 2005; Sorum et al . , 2015 ) , the 'molecular glue' effect of bound ATP is further strengthened when the channel reaches the stable open state . The implication is that some rearrangements must still occur within the dimer interface between the transition state and the open state . One possibility is that , in the transition state , site 1 has not yet reached its full open-channel-like conformation . Perhaps the site 2 'glue' bonds fully already in the transition state , whereas bonding of the site 1 'glue' is completed only in the open-channel state . Further work will be needed to address the precise timing of site 1 motions during channel opening , and their contributions to CFTR gating energetics . 
 Mutations introduced ( Stratagene , QuikChange ) into pGEMHE-CFTR were confirmed by automated sequencing; cDNA was transcribed in vitro ( Ambion , mMessage T7 ) and cRNA stored at −80°C . Oocytes were isolated from anaesthetized adult female Xenopus laevis frogs following Institutional Animal Care Committee guidelines , injected with 0 . 1–10 ng cRNA in a fixed 50 nl volume , and stored at 18°C as described ( Szollosi et al . , 2010 ) . Current recordings were obtained 1–3 days after injection . The patch pipette solution contained ( in mM ) : 136 NMDG-Cl , 2 MgCl2 , 5 HEPES , pH = 7 . 4 with NMDG . Bath solution contained ( in mM ) : 134 NMDG-Cl , 2 MgCl2 , 5 HEPES , 0 . 5 EGTA , pH = 7 . 1 with NMDG , and was freshly supplemented with 3 mM DTT to prevent thiol oxidation of the cysteine side chain engineered into position 978 . MgATP ( 2 mM ) was added from a 400 mM aqueous stock solution ( pH = 7 . 1 with NMDG ) . The catalytic subunit of PKA ( 300 nM , Sigma ) was applied for ~1 min to activate CFTR channels . Experiments were done at 25°C . Currents were recorded at a membrane potential of −80 mV , digitized at 10 kHz , and recorded to disk after on-line Gaussian filtering at 2 kHz . For macroscopic recordings of P355A-K978C CFTR , baseline current was estimated by brief replacements of bath chloride ions with gluconate ( Figure 1c , red bars ) ; at −80 mV no CFTR currents are observable under such ionic conditions ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . For microscopic recordings channels were pre-phosphorylated by PKA , and gating in the absence of ATP was observed for 5 min , bracketed by 2 . 5 min exposures to ATP . The number of active channels was estimated based on the high-Po bracketing segments ( cf . , Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) . To allow for loss of ATP even from the higher affinity site 1 , which retains ATP for tens of seconds ( Tsai et al . , 2010 ) , spontaneous gating parameters were extracted from the last ~4 min stretches of the 5 min ATP-free segments; precise starting points for the quasi-steady segment to be analyzed were chosen in each patch based on visual inspection . Segments of current recording were digitally filtered at 50 Hz , and idealized by half-amplitude threshold crossing . Open probabilities in the absence ( Figure 2e ) and presence ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 ) of ATP were calculated from the events lists as the time-average of the fraction of open channels . Spontaneous channel opening and closing rates were calculated as described ( Vergani et al . , 2005 ) , from ATP-free segments containing no more than 7 superimposed channel openings . A closed-open-blocked ( C-O-B ) kinetic scheme , which separates brief ( ~10 ms ) flickery closures ( to state B ) from long ( >1 s ) interburst closures ( to state C ) , was fitted by maximum likelihood to the set of dwell-time histograms for all conductance levels , to obtain microscopic transition rates rCO , rOC , rOB , and rBO , while accounting for a fixed dead time of 6 ms ( Csanády , 2000 ) . Mean burst ( τb ) and interburst ( τib ) durations were calculated as τb= ( 1/rOC ) ( 1+rOB/rBO ) and τib=1/rCO , and channel opening and closing rates defined as 1/τib and 1/τb , respectively . Changes in interaction strength between pairs of residues associated with various steps of the gating cycle were estimated using mutant cycle analysis , as described previously ( Vergani et al . , 2005 ) . For a conformational transition from state A to state B of the protein , energetic coupling ( ΔΔGint ) between positions 1 and 2 is defined as the difference between mutation-induced changes in the stability of state B relative to state A along parallel sides of the mutant cycle , i . e . , ( 1 ) ΔΔGint=ΔΔGB−A0 ( X′Y→X′Y′ ) −ΔΔGB−A0 ( XY→XY′ ) =ΔΔGB−A0 ( XY′→X′Y′ ) −ΔΔGB−A0 ( XY→X′Y ) Here the superscripts refer to the pairs of residues found at target positions 1 and 2 of the four studied constructs ( e . g . , XY: residue X at position 1 and residue Y at position 2; XY': residue X at position 1 and residue Y' at position 2; etc . ) , and arrows represent substitutions in a particular background ( e . g . , XY→XY': mutation of position 2 from Y to Y' , with X at position 1 ) . If states A and B are stable ( 'ground' ) states of the protein , then the energetic stability of state B relative to state A can be calculated from the measured equilibrium constant ( Keq ) as ΔGB−A0=−kTlnKeq ( k is Boltzmann's constant , T is absolute temperature ) , and hence the two terms in Equation 1 are obtained as follows:ΔΔGB−A0 ( X′Y→X′Y′ ) =ΔGB−A0 ( X′Y′ ) −ΔGB−A0 ( X′Y ) =−kTln ( Keq ( X′Y′ ) /Keq ( X′Y ) ) , andΔΔGB−A0 ( XY→XY′ ) =ΔGB−A0 ( XY′ ) −ΔGB−A0 ( XY ) =−kTln ( Keq ( XY′ ) /Keq ( XY ) ) . In this study , we used the equilibrium constant between the spontaneous closed- and open-channel state , Keq=Po/ ( 1−Po ) ( Figure 2h ) . Analogously , mutation-induced changes in activation free energy barriers , calculated from fractional changes in transition rates , can also be substituted into Equation 1 . For instance , for the transition A→T‡→B ( T‡ is the transition state ) the two terms for Equation 1 are obtained as follows:ΔΔGT−A0 ( X′Y→X′Y′ ) =−kTln ( rAB ( X′Y′ ) /rAB ( X′Y ) ) , andΔΔGT−A0 ( XY→XY′ ) =−kTln ( rAB ( XY′ ) /rAB ( XY ) ) , where rAB is the transition rate from state A to state B . In this study , we calculated mutation-induced changes in activation free energy barriers for channel opening ( ΔΔGT−C0 ) and closing ( ΔΔGT−O0 ) from the fractional changes in opening and closing rates , respectively ( Figure 2i–j ) . All ΔΔGs are given as mean ± SEM . Estimates of SEM for ΔΔGo values were obtained as follows . All ΔΔG values are functions of the form ΔΔG=kTln ( u/v ) of two independent random variables u and v which represent a specific gating parameter ( Keq , rCO , or rOC ) of two different channel constructs . Assuming that u and v are normally distributed with mean m ( mu , mv ) and variance σ2 ( σu2 , σv2 ) , the variance of ln ( u/v ) is given byvar ( ln ( u/v ) ) =∫−∞∞∫−∞∞ln2 ( u/v ) ⋅12π⋅e− ( u−mu ) 22σu2⋅e− ( v−mv ) 22σv2dudv− ( ∫−∞∞∫−∞∞ln ( u/v ) ⋅12π⋅e− ( u−mu ) 22σu2⋅e− ( v−mv ) 22σv2dudv ) 2 The above integrals cannot be performed analytically , but the functions ln ( u/v ) and ln2 ( u/v ) can be expanded into power series around ( mu , mv ) . Taking the terms only up to second order , the integrals can be performed , giving the approximationvar ( ln ( u/v ) ) ≈σu2mu2+σv2mv2+12⋅σu2mu2⋅σv2mv2−14⋅ ( σu4mu4+σv4mv4 ) The power series approximations hold as long as σu≪mu , σv≪mv; thus , for σu=0 . 2mu , σv=0 . 2mv this estimate of the variance for ln ( u/v ) is still quite accurate , and was used to obtain var ( ΔΔGB-A0 ) values . Since the numbers of observations for each pair of constructs ( e . g . , nXY and nXY' ) was similar , standard errors were calculated using the mean values for n . E . g . , SEM ( ΔΔGB−A0 ( XY→XY′ ) ) =var ( ΔΔGB−A0 ( XY→XY′ ) ) /n¯ , where n¯= ( nXY+nXY' ) /2 . Variances for energetic coupling were obtained as var ( ΔΔGint ) =var ( ΔΔGB−A0 ( X′Y→X′Y′ ) ) +var ( ΔΔGB−A0 ( XY→XY′ ) ) . Finally , since the numbers of observations for each corner of a cycle ( nXY , nXY' , nX'Y , nX'Y' ) were similar , standard errors for energetic coupling were calculated as SEM ( ΔΔGint ) =var ( ΔΔGint ) /n¯ , where n¯= ( nXY+nXY'+nX'Y+nX'Y' ) /4 . The values of ΔΔGint obtained from the above two types of mutant cycle are conventionally interpreted to reflect the change in the strength of the interaction ( in WT ) between the two target residues X and Y upon transiting from stable ground state A either to stable ground state B , or to transition state T‡ , respectively . This interpretation assumes that the native interaction between residues X and Y is destroyed in both single mutants and the double mutant ( valid , e . g . , for side chain truncations ) ( Horovitz , 1996 ) . However , if an interaction is restored in the double mutant X'Y' , then the measured ΔΔGint reports the sum of the changes in interaction strengths for residue pairs X-Y ( in WT ) and X'-Y' ( in the double mutant ) . Choosing such mutations ( e . g . , ( Vergani et al . , 2005 ) ; present study ) provides a convenient signal amplification which facilitates separating the signal from noise . All data are presented as mean ± S . E . M , estimated from current recordings obtained from n ( ≥5 ) patches as specified in each figure legend . All data were included in the analysis . Statistical significance was quantified using Student's t test , and differences are reported as significant for p<0 . 05 .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['biochemistry and chemical biology', 'structural biology and molecular biophysics']",elife-18164-v3,231,6442,6211,27.88744588744589

A cell’s membrane is made up of two layers of molecules with oily tails , and is therefore known as a bilayer . Many proteins are dotted within and on the inner and outer surfaces of the bilayer: some act as channels that control what goes in and out of the cell , while others protrude outside the cell so that they can sense changes in the environment . Membrane proteins can move and interact within the bilayer , and various models have emerged to try to explain this dynamic system . These models are based on the membrane having some fluidity but also having regions where there is more structure , and typically describe the proteins as ordered clusters floating in an otherwise disordered fluid membrane . However , many researchers now think some proteins that pass through both layers of the bilayer ( i . e . , transmembrane proteins ) make membranes more ordered , with a possibly gel-like state . However , it is not clear how transmembrane proteins can move and assemble together within such a relatively rigid membrane . To investigate this , Katira , Mandadapu , Vaikuntanathan et al . carried out computer simulations using a model of a simple bilayer membrane . This membrane can exist in an ordered state , where the oily tails are neatly aligned , or a disordered state , where they are irregularly packed . Virtual ‘heating’ of the membrane caused it to shift from an ordered to a disordered state . When a simple transmembrane protein favoring the disordered state was inserted into the ordered state of the modeled membrane , disordered regions formed locally around the protein and the protein was able to diffuse within the membrane . Modeling what would happen if two transmembrane proteins approached each other revealed that a consequence of the order–disorder transition is a strong attractive force that assembles the proteins together . Katira , Mandadapu , Vaikuntanathan et al . named this new phenomenon the 'orderphobic effect' . The forces arising from this effect were much greater than those currently believed to contribute to the assembly of membrane protein complexes , such as those generated by the elasticity of the membrane . This means that the orderphobic effect may be responsible for generating the protein clusters commonly seen in cell membranes . Future work should next explore the opposite effect , where proteins favoring the ordered state are inserted into the disordered state of a membrane . This is expected to cause clustering of such proteins and thus large ordered regions in an otherwise disordered membrane .","We present a mechanism for a generic , powerful force of assembly and mobility for transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers . This force is a pre-transition ( or pre-melting ) effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane . Using large-scale molecular simulation , we show that a protein with hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic order–disorder interface . The stiffness of that interface is finite . When two such proteins approach each other , they assemble because assembly reduces the net interfacial energy . Analogous to the hydrophobic effect , we refer to this phenomenon as the 'orderphobic effect' . The effect is mediated by proximity to the order–disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein . The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those that could arise from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered . 
 We choose the MARTINI model of hydrated dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine ( DPPC ) lipid bilayers ( Marrink et al . , 2007 ) to illustrate the orderphobic effect . See Materials and methods . This membrane model exhibits an ordered phase and a disordered phase . Figure 1A contrasts configurations from the two phases , and it shows our estimated phase boundary between the two phases . The ordered phase has regular tail packing compared to the disorganized tail arrangement of the disordered phase . A consequence of the regular tail packing is that hydrophobic thickness of the ordered phase , 𝒟o is larger than that of the disordered phase , 𝒟d . Correspondingly , the area per lipid in the ordered phase is smaller than that in the disordered phase . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13150 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13150 . 003 Rendering the end particles of all the lipid chains in one of the two monolayers provides a convenient visual representation that distinguishes the two phases . These tail-end particles appear hexagonally-packed in the ordered phase and randomly arranged in the disordered phase . Regions that appear empty in this rendering are in fact typically filled by non tail-end particles or by tail-end particles from the other lipid monolayer . To quantify the distinctions between the two phases , we consider a local rotational-invariant ( Nelson , 2002; Halperin and Nelson , 1978; Frenkel et al . , 1980 ) , ϕl=| ( 1/6 ) ∑j∈nn ( l ) exp⁡ ( 6iθlj ) |2 , where θlj is the angle between an arbitrary axis and a vector connecting tail-end particle l to tail-end particle j , and the summation is over the six nearest neighbors of particle l . The equilibrium average , ⟨ϕl⟩ , is 1 for a perfect hexagonal packing , and it is 1/6 or smaller in the absence of bond-orientation correlations . Small periodically replicated samples of the hydrated DPPC membrane exhibit hysteretic changes in area per lipid and in ⟨ϕl⟩ during heating and cooling . See Appendix , and Marrink et al . ( 2005 ) and Rodgers et al . ( 2012 ) . To establish whether the first-order-like behavior persists to large scales and thus actually manifests a phase transition , we consider larger systems and the behavior of the interface that separates the ordered and disordered phases . Figure 1B shows coexistence for a system size of N = 3900 lipids with an interface between the two phases . To analyze interfacial fluctuations , we first identify the location of the interface at each instant . This location is found with a two-dimensional version of the three-dimensional constructions described in Limmer and Chandler ( 2014 ) and Willard and Chandler ( 2010 ) . Specifically , and as discussed in Materials and methods , the interface is the line in the plane of the bilayer with an intermediate coarse-grained value of the orientational-order density , ( 1 ) ϕ ( r ) =∑lϕlδ ( r−rl ) . where rl is the position of the lth tail-end particle projected onto a plane parallel to that of the bilayer , r is a two-dimensional vector specifying a position in that plane , and δ ( r ) is Dirac’s delta function . We focus on this field rather than the tail-end number density , ρ ( r ) =∑lδ ( r−rl ) , because the difference between the two phases is larger for typical orientational-order than for typical tail-end density . A director density field , u ( r ) =∑lulδ ( r−rl ) , could also be used to distinguish disordered regions from ordered regions . ul would specify the degree to which the hydrophobic chain of lipid l is perpendicular to the average plane of the membrane . A field of this form would be useful for systems where liquid-ordered behavior occurs in the absence of solid-ordered behavior . Multicomponent membranes , for example , can exist in solid-ordered , liquid-ordered , and liquid-disordered states . For constructing the order–disorder interface of the simple one-component membrane considered here , however , u ( r ) offers little more information than ϕ ( r ) . Figure 1C shows the Fourier spectrum of the height fluctuations of this interface , ⟨|δhk|2⟩ . Two different system sizes are studied , with the larger system having approximately double the interface length of the smaller system . The Fourier component δhk is related to the height fluctuation δh ( x ) as δh ( x ) =∑kδhkexp⁡ ( ikx ) where x is a point along the horizontal in Figure 1B . Here , 0⩽x⩽L , and L is the box length . With periodic boundary conditions , k=2πm/L , m=0 , ±1 , ±2 , ⋯ . According to capillarity theory for crystal–liquid interfaces ( Nozières , 1992; Fisher et al . , 1982 ) , ⟨|δhk|2⟩∼kBT/Lγk2 for small k , with kB being Boltzmann’s constant . Given the proportionality with 1/k2 at small k ( i . e . , wavelengths larger than 10 nm ) , comparison of the proportionality constants from simulation and capillarity theory determines the interfacial stiffness ( Camley et al . , 2010 ) , yielding γ=11 . 5±0 . 46 pN . This value is significantly larger than the prior estimate of interfacial stiffness for this model , 3±2 pN ( Marrink et al . , 2005 ) . That prior estimate was obtained from simulations of coarsening of the ordered phase . Because the ordered phase has a hexagonal packing , the interfacial stiffness depends on the angle between the interface and the lattice of the ordered phase . For a hexagonal lattice , there are three symmetric orientations for which the interfacial stiffnesses are equal . We will see that for the model we have simulated there appears to be only little angle dependence . Irrespective of that angle dependence , the stability of the interface and the quantitative consistency with capillary scaling provide our evidence for the order–disorder transition being a first-order transition in the model we have simulated . The system sizes we have considered contain up to 107 particles , allowing for membranes with N ≈ 104 lipids , and requiring 10 μs to equilibrate . As such , our straightforward simulations are unable to determine whether the ordered phase is hexatic or crystal because correlation functions that would distinguish one from the other ( Nelson et al . , 1982 ) require equilibrating systems at least 10 times larger ( Bernard and Krauth , 2011 ) . Similarly , we are unable to determine the range of conditions for which the membranes organize with ripples and with tilted lipids ( Sirota et al . , 1988; Smith et al . , 1990 ) . Presumably , the ordered domain of the phase diagram in Figure 1A partitions into several subdomains coinciding with one or more of these possibilities . With advanced sampling techniques ( Frenkel and Smit , 2001 ) , free energy functions of characteristic order parameters can be computed to estimate the positions of boundaries between these various ordered behaviors . Here , we do not pursue this additional level of detail in the phase diagram because the additional boundaries refer to continuous transitions ( Sirota et al . , 1988 ) . It is only the first-order transition , with its discontinuous change between ordered and disordered phases , that supports coexistence with a finite interfacial stiffness , and it is this stiffness that results in the orderphobic effect , which we turn to now . A disordering ( i . e . , orderphobic ) transmembrane protein is one that solvates more favorably in the disordered phase than in the ordered phase . The disordering effect of the protein could be produced by specific side chain structures . See Appendix . Here , in the main text , we consider a simpler mechanism . In particular , we have chosen to focus on the size of the protein’s hydrophobic thickness and the extent to which that thickness matches the thickness of the membrane’s hydrophobic layer ( Killian , 1998; Sharpe et al . , 2010 ) . See Figure 2 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13150 . 004Figure 2 . Model proteins in the bilayer . ( A ) Idealized cylindrical protein-like solutes with radius R and hydrophobic thickness ℓ ( magenta ) . The hydrophilic caps of the protein are shown in white .

( C ) The radial variation of the order parameters ⟨ϕ ( r ) ⟩ ( right axis ) and ⟨ϕ ( r ) ⟩/⟨ρ ( r ) ⟩ ( left axis ) show disorder in the vicinity of the protein of radius 1 . 9 nm . ( D ) Comparison of the radial order parameter variation for three different proteins shows an increase in the extent of the induced disorder region with protein radius . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13150 . 004 The membrane’s hydrophobic layer is thicker in the ordered state than in the disordered state . For instance , at zero lateral pressure and 294 K in the model DPPC membrane , we find that the average thicknesses of the hydrophobic layers in the ordered and disordered states are 𝒟o=3 . 1 nm and 𝒟d=2 . 6 nm , respectively . A transmembrane protein with hydrophobic thickness of size ℓ≈2 . 6 nm will therefore favor the structure of the disordered phase . If the protein is large enough , it can melt the ordered phase near the protein and result in the formation of an order–disorder interface . To evaluate whether a model protein is nucleating a disordered domain in its vicinity , we calculate the average of the orientational-order density field as a function of r=|r| , ⟨ϕ ( r ) ⟩ ( right axis of Figure 2C ) . It exhibits oscillations manifesting the atomistic granularity of the system . Dividing by the mean density ⟨ρ ( r ) ⟩ largely removes these oscillations . A profile of this ratio in the vicinity of the protein is depicted in Figure 2C ( left axis ) . It changes approximately sigmoidally , connecting its values of 0 . 15 and 0 . 45 in the disordered and ordered phases , respectively . The shape of the profile suggests the formation of an order–disorder interface ( Rowlinson and Widom , 1982 ) . Further , the increase in the spatial extent of the disordered region with the increasing size of the protein , Figure 2D , is indicative of length scale dependent broadening effects brought about by capillary fluctuations . These impressions can be quantified by analyzing fluctuations of the instantaneous interface , which we turn to now . Figure 3A shows a configuration of the instantaneous interface that forms around the orderphobic protein shown in Figure 2B . The interface is identified as described above . A video of its dynamics is provided as Video 1 . As is common in crystal–liquid interfaces , the interface nucleated by an orderphobic protein may exhibit hexagonal faceting ( Nozières , 1992 ) , remnants of which can be observed in Figure 3A . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13150 . 005Figure 3 .

Far away from the protein , the tail-end particles show hexagonal-like packing and are in the ordered state . Proximal to the protein , it can be seen that the tail-end particles are randomly arranged , and resemble the disordered phase . The line connected by the black points denotes the instantaneous order–disorder interface .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13150 . 006 The mean interface is a circle of radius ℛ0 . Fourier analysis of fluctuations about that circle yields a spectrum of components . To the extent that these fluctuations obey statistics of capillary wave theory for a circular interface , the mean-square fluctuation for the kth component is ⟨|δℛk|2⟩=kBT/2πγk2ℛ0 , where k=m/ℛ0 and m=±1 , ±2 , ⋯ , and γ is the order–disorder interfacial stiffness , neglecting the dependence on the angle between the interface and the lattice . The discrete values of k reflect periodic boundary conditions going full circle around the model protein . In Figure 3B , we use the interfacial stiffness from the free interface ( γ=11 . 5 pN ) separating coexisting ordered and disordered phases with the capillary theory expression , and its corresponding spectrum , to compare with the spectrum of the protein-induced interface . The agreement between the theory , the free interface and the protein-induced interface is good , and it improves as the radius of the orderphobic protein increases and the wave vector k decreases . This agreement indicates that the orderphobic protein does indeed nucleate an interface manifesting the order–disorder transition . The deviations of the fluctuations of the free interface from capillary wave theory occur for k≳0 . 8 nm−1 , corresponding to wavelengths 2π/k≲7 nm , and a mean interface radius ℛ0≲1 nm . Indeed , Figure 2 suggests that even a small protein of radius 0 . 5 nm , which supports an interface of radius ℛ0≈1 . 2 nm , is sufficient to induce an order–disorder interface with fluctuations consistent with capillary theory . Figure 4 shows three snapshots from a typical trajectory initiated with two orderphobic proteins of radius 1 . 5 nm separated by a distance of 14 nm . Each induces a disordered region in its vicinity , with soft interfaces separating the ordered and disordered regions . The free energy of the separated state is approximately γ ( P1+P2 ) , where Pi is the perimeter of the order–disorder interface around protein i . On average , ⟨Pi⟩=2πℛ0 . After a few hundred nanoseconds , a fluctuation occurs where the two interfaces combine . While the single large interface remains intact , the finite tension of the interface pulls the two proteins together . Eventually , the tension pulls the two proteins together with a final perimeter , Pf , that is typically much smaller than P1+P2 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13150 . 008 After the separated interfaces join , the assembly process occurs on the time scale of microseconds . This time is required for the proteins to push away lipids that lie in the path of the assembling proteins . Given this time scale , a reversible work calculation of the binding free energy would best control both the distance and the number of lipids between the proteins . Moreover , the evident role of interfacial fluctuations indicates that the transition state ensemble for assembly must involve an interplay between inter-protein separations and lipid ordering as well as lipid concentration . While we leave the study of reversible work surfaces and transition state ensembles to future work , it seems already clear that the net driving force for assembly is large compared to thermal energies . For example , with a model orderphobic protein radius of 1 . 5 nm , we find γ ( ⟨Pf⟩−2⟨P1⟩ ) ≈−30kBT . The range over which the force acts is given by the average radius of the two interfaces , 2ℛ0 . This range is further amplified by the width of the interface , which is of 𝒪 ( ℛ0 ) for one-dimensional interfaces in two-dimensional systems ( Kardar , 2007 ) . The typical range is ≈10 to 30 nm . In comparison , given the elastic moduli of the membranes we consider , elastic responses will generate attractive forces between transmembrane proteins that are much smaller in strength and range , typically −5kBT and 1 nm , respectively ( Haselwandter and Phillips , 2013; de Meyer et al . , 2008 ) . Moreover , similarly weak and short ranged forces are found from solvation theory that accounts for linear response in microscopic detail while not accounting for the possibility of an underlying phase transition ( Lagüe et al . , 1998 ) . As in the hydrophobic effect ( Chandler , 2005 ) , the strength and range of the orderphobic force leverages the power of a phase transition , depending in this case on the ability of the orderphobic protein to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity . This ability depends upon the proximity to the membrane’s phase transition , and , for the simple protein models considered in this paper , it depends upon the protein’s radius and hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane . The spatial extent of the disordered region increases with proximity to phase coexistence as shown in Figure 5A . 10 . 7554/eLife . 13150 . 009Figure 5 . Strength of the orderphobic force . ( A ) Radial variation of the order parameter showing the extent of the disordered region as a function of temperature , for a protein of radius 1 . 9 nm and hydrophobic thickness 2 . 3 nm .

( B ) Comparison of the radial variation of the order parameter for different hydrophobic mismatches . Proteins with no mismatch do not create any disordered region . ( C ) Arrangement of lipids around a protein with negative mismatch . ( D ) Arrangement of lipids around a protein with zero mismatch . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 13150 . 009 Furthermore , Figure 5B shows that the strength of the effect is maximal for a hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase , and it decreases as the hydrophobic thickness approaches that of the ordered phase . In the case of zero mismatch ( i . e . , ℓ=𝒟o ) the value of the order parameter in the vicinity of the protein is consistent with that of a pure bilayer in the ordered state . Therefore , the model proteins with zero mismatch do not induce a disordered region , and the orderphobic effect vanishes . See Figure 5B and D . Figure 4 also shows that the orderphobic effect produces excess mobility , by proteins melting order in a surrounding microscopic layer and by facilitating the motions of neighboring proteins . This finding explains how protein mobility and reorganization can be relatively facile in the so-called 'gel' phases of membranes . Further information on this phenomenon is provided in Appendix . Our prediction of enhanced lipid mobility surrounding orderphobic proteins may be amenable to experimental tests by single molecule tracking techniques ( Eggeling et al . , 2009 ) . Biological membranes and transmembrane proteins are far more complicated than the models considered in this paper . Part of the complexity is associated with multiple components , which allow for more than one order–disorder transition . For example , with a membrane composed of three components , coexistence can be established between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases ( Veatch and Keller , 2005 ) , and both of these phases exist in bio-membranes ( Swamy et al . , 2006; Owen et al . , 2012; Polozov et al . , 2008 ) . The fact that liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases can coexist with finite line tension ( Veatch and Keller , 2005 ) implies the existence of a first-order transition between them ( Chandler , 1987 ) and thus the relevance of the orderphobic effect . This effect is much wider in applicability than the Casimir effect ( Machta et al . , 2012 ) , which applies only within the much smaller range of conditions where the first-order transition reaches its limiting case of criticality . A director density for hydrophobic chains serves as the order parameter distinguishing liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases . The strength and range of orderphobic effects that will arise from this order–disorder transition merit future investigation . Modeling might build from recent numerical work on the liquid-ordered phase ( Risselada and Marrink , 2008 ) . Bear in mind that the strength and range of the orderphobic effect depends upon the proximity of the order–disorder transition . This proximity can be changed by changing temperature , as illustrated in Figure 5A . With many components in play , the proximity can also be changed by varying membrane composition . One can therefore anticipate that the strength and range of orderphobic effects will depend upon , for example , cholesterol concentrations . It will also depend upon the presence of additional proteins , and the domains formed with those proteins themselves depend upon the orderphobic effect . Another source of complexity is the side-chain structure of transmembrane proteins . These side chains can affect the packing of lipid chains . To the extent that lipid packing is disrupted , even small α-helix proteins can be orderphobic . Evidence for this assessment is provided in Appendix . Thus , the orderphobic effect can lead to clustering of transmembrane α-helices . Moreover , just as the strength and range of the orderphobic effect can be modified by changing the radius and mismatch of our model proteins , the strength and range of the orderphobic effect will also be affected by the structure of protein side chains . Further , an obvious consequence of the orderphobic effect is the existence of a driving force that will move orderphobic proteins from an ordered phase to a disordered phase , and the creation of large disordered domains as a result of clustering orderphobic proteins . Both of these effects have been noted in simulations of disordering α-helix proteins in a membrane exhibiting coexisting liquid-ordered and liquid disordered domains ( Schäfer et al . , 2011; Domański et al . , 1818 ) . Further , there is a dual to the orderphobic effect: a transmembrane protein in the disordered phase that favors the ordered phase can nucleate an ordered region and order–disorder interface . For example , one of our model proteins with a positive mismatch ( ℓ=𝒟o ) would induce order in its vicinity . This effect is illustrated in the Appendix . Interfaces separating the ordered and disordered regions will again provide a force for assembly . This case corresponds to the situation of lipid rafts ( Simons and Ikonen , 1997 ) , which consists of ordered domains floating in otherwise disordered membranes . The stable interface separating domains then serves as a concrete geometrical definition of the raft . This orderphilic effect will depend upon the extent to which the surface of the transmembrane protein is commensurate with the ordered phase structure . Hydrophobic mismatch is but one possibility . β-sheets that align neighboring lipids are others . The fact that the orderphilic effect is a pre-transition effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases implies it should occur in disordered membranes that are thermodynamically close to coexistence between liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases . The orderphobic effect may also be of direct relevance in understanding the behavior of lung-surfactant monolayers . The primary component of these monolayers is the lipid DPPC , with melting temperature higher than physiological temperature ( 41°C ) , and a small proportion of cholesterol , and proteins . These monolayers undergo cyclic surface tension mediated phase transitions between the ordered and disordered phases ( Nag et al . , 1998 ) . The results of this paper are also applicable to lipid monolayers and could govern the diffusion and assembly of proteins embedded within the relatively rigid ordered phases . Finally , we speculate that the orderphobic effect plays important roles in membrane fusion , budding , and cell signaling ( Fratti et al . , 2004; Zick et al . , 2014; Qi et al . , 2001; James and Vale , 2012; Różycki et al . , 2012 ) . In the case of fusion , it would appear that one important role is to promote fluctuations in an otherwise stable membrane . Otherwise , it is difficult to conceive of a mechanism by which thermal agitation would be sufficient to destabilize microscopic sections of membranes . Such destabilization seems necessary for initiating and facilitating membrane fusion . Many proteins are involved in such processes ( Fratti et al . , 2004; Fasshauer et al . , 1998; Wickner and Schekman , 2008 ) , but it may not be a coincidence that the hydrophobic thicknesses of SNARE proteins are 25% smaller than that of the ordered membrane states ( Milovanovic et al . , 2015; Stein et al . , 2015 ) . 
 We simulate the MARTINI coarse-grained force field using the GROMACS molecular dynamics package ( Marrink et al . , 2007; Pronk et al . , 2013 ) . ‘Antifreeze’ particles are added to the solvent to ensure that the solvent does not freeze over the temperature range considered in the simulations as in Marrink et al . ( 2007 ) . Thermostats and barostats control temperature and pressure , and checks were performed to assure that different thermostats and barostats yielded similar results ( Frenkel and Smit , 2001 ) . The hydrophobic cores of our idealized proteins are constructed using the same coarse-grained beads as the lipid tails ( particle C1 in the MARTINI topology Marrink et al . ( 2007 ) ) . Similarly , the hydrophilic caps are constructed using the first bead of the DPPC head group ( Q0 , in the MARTINI topology ) . The protein beads also have bonded interactions where the bond length is 0 . 45 nm and the bond angle is set to 180° . The associated harmonic force constants for the bond lengths and angles are 1250 kJmol−1nm−2 and 25 kJmol−1rad−2 . Based on the hydrophobic mismatch with the bilayers , the proteins are classified into three categories: ( i ) positive mismatch ( ℓ>𝒟o ) ( ii ) negative mismatch ( ℓ≤𝒟d ) and ( iii ) no mismatch ( ℓ≈𝒟o ) . To create different mismatches , we alter the number of beads in the protein core . These idealized proteins do not contain charges . Proteins are embedded in the equilibrated bilayer at 279 K . The resulting system is then heated to the required temperature and equilibrated for another 1 . 2 µs . All the subsequent averages are performed using 10 independent trajectories each 600 ns long . The assembly of proteins is also performed using the same DPPC bilayer system with 3200 lipids and 50000 water beads . In this case , two proteins are inserted in this bilayer with centers at a distance of 14 nm and the simulation is carried out at 309 K . The flat interface is stabilized by juxtaposing an ordered bilayer equilibrated at 285 K and zero lateral pressure with a disordered bilayer equilibrated at the same conditions corresponding to the cooling and heating curves of the hysteresis loop in Appendix 1—figure 1 , respectively . The system thus constructed is equilibrated in the ensemble with fixed temperature , volume , and numbers of particles . This ensemble allows for maintaining an area per lipid intermediate between the two phases , thus stabilizing the interface . For the purpose of obtaining a smooth and continuous interface , ϕ ( r ) is coarse grained by replacing Dirac’s delta function with a finite-width Gaussian , ( 1/2πξ2 ) exp⁡ ( −|r|2/2ξ2 ) . The replacement changes ϕ ( r ) to ϕ¯ ( r ) . The coarse-graining width , ξ , is chosen to be the average separation between tail-end particles l and j when ⟨ ( ϕl−⟨ϕl⟩ ) ( ϕj−⟨ϕj⟩ ) ⟩/⟨ ( ϕl−⟨ϕl⟩ ) 2⟩ in the ordered phase is 1/10 . This choice yields a value of ξ=1 . 5 nm . The instantaneous order–disorder interface is the set of points s satisfying ϕ¯ ( s , t ) = ( ϕd+ϕo ) /2 . Here , ϕd and ϕo are ⟨ϕ ( r ) ⟩ evaluated in the disordered and ordered phases , respectively . At zero lateral pressure and 294 K , we find ϕd=0 . 4 ± 0 . 02 nm−2 and ϕo=2 . 15±0 . 2 nm−2 . For numerics , a square lattice tiles the average plane of the bilayer , and the coarse-grained field ϕ¯ ( r ) is evaluated at each lattice node . Values between are determined by interpolation . For convenience , the Gaussian function is truncated and shifted to zero at 3ξ . Any value of ξ within the range , 1 nm <ξ< 2 nm gives nearly identical ϕ¯ ( r ) . Outside that range , larger values obscure detail by excessive smoothing , and smaller values obscure detail by capturing a high density of short-lived bubbles of disorder .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Materials and methods']",['structural biology and molecular biophysics'],elife-13150-v2,139,5486,5347,39.46762589928058

Studying the spiking patterns of neurons in the brain is essential to understand perception , memory , thought , and behaviour . One way to do that is by recording electrical activity with microelectrodes . Another way to study neuronal activity is by using molecules that change how they interact with light when calcium binds to them , since changes in calcium concentration can be indicative of neuronal spiking . That change can be observed with specialized microscopes know as two-photon fluorescence microscopes . Using calcium indicators , it is possible to simultaneously record hundreds or even thousands of neurons . However , calcium fluorescence and spikes do not translate one-to-one . In order to interpret fluorescence data , it is important to understand the relationship between the fluorescence signals and the spikes associated with individual neurons . The only way to directly measure this relationship is by using calcium imaging and electrical recording simultaneously to record activity from the same neuron . However , this is extremely challenging experimentally , so this type of data is rare . To shed some light on this , Huang , Ledochowitsch et al . used mice that had been genetically modified to produce a calcium indicator in neurons of the visual cortex and simultaneously obtained both fluorescence measurements and electrical recordings from these neurons . These experiments revealed that , while the majority of time periods containing multi-spike neural activity could be identified using calcium imaging microscopy , on average , less than 10% of isolated single spikes were detectable . This is an important caveat that researchers need to take into consideration when interpreting calcium imaging results . These findings are intended to serve as a guide for interpreting calcium imaging studies that look at neurons in the mammalian brain at the population level . In addition , the data provided will be useful as a reference for the development of activity sensors , and to benchmark and improve computational approaches for detecting and predicting spikes .","Fluorescent calcium indicators are often used to investigate neural dynamics , but the relationship between fluorescence and action potentials ( APs ) remains unclear . Most APs can be detected when the soma almost fills the microscope’s field of view , but calcium indicators are used to image populations of neurons , necessitating a large field of view , generating fewer photons per neuron , and compromising AP detection . Here , we characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer function in vivo for 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex , with simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f . While most APs were detected under optimal conditions , under conditions typical of population imaging studies , only a minority of 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected ( often <10% and ~20–30% , respectively ) , emphasizing the limits of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions . 
 Genetically encoded calcium indicators ( GECIs ) are widely used with two-photon laser scanning microscopy to report neuronal activity within local populations in vivo ( Luo et al . , 2018 ) . This optical approach is minimally invasive and enables simultaneous measurement of activity from hundreds or even thousands of neurons at single-cell resolution , over multiple sessions . Using a contemporary GECI such as GCaMP6s , fluorescence changes associated with isolated spikes ( action potentials , APs ) in vivo can be detected when imaged at sufficiently high spatiotemporal resolution ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) ( http://dx . doi . org/10 . 6080/K02R3PMN ) . Yet undetected APs are common in population imaging experiments ( Theis et al . , 2016; Berens et al . , 2018 ) . Inferring the underlying AP train or firing rate from calcium imaging remains challenging for several reasons . First , population imaging studies necessarily employ a large field of view containing many neurons . In contrast , the AP to calcium-dependent fluorescence transfer function is typically characterized with a soma filling the field of view of the microscope , to maximize photon flux from the soma and thereby signal-to-noise ratio . Second , there is no ground truth spiking information available for most neurons in a population . Spiking information , often from a cell-attached recording , can be used to refine the spike inference model and thereby optimize AP detection . Third , the AP to calcium-dependent fluorescence transfer function may be different for each neuron due to various intrinsic and extrinsic factors , such as neuron-to-neuron differences in indicator expression . Compared to viral expression , transgenic mouse lines offer convenience ( e . g . bypassing virus injection and associated procedures ) and achieve more uniform GECI expression in genetically defined neuronal populations ( Madisen et al . , 2015; Daigle et al . , 2018 ) . Using our intersectional transgenic mouse lines that enable Cre recombinase-dependent expression of GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f , we simultaneously characterized the spiking activity and fluorescence of individual GECI-expressing pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex ( V1 ) . We then tested the performance of several spike inference models , detecting APs under optimal conditions ( models refined using the spiking information , with the soma filling the field of view ) and under the less optimal conditions typical of population imaging experiments . Our results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals and will aid the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging datasets . 
 Fluorescence measured from the soma is contaminated with fluorescence from the surrounding neuropil , due to the extended nature of the microscope point spread function . Neuropil contamination is often removed by subtracting a scaled version of the neuropil fluorescence from the somatic fluorescence , with the scale factor referred to as the r value ( Kerlin et al . , 2010; Akerboom et al . , 2012 ) . The r value can affect AP detection , with under-subtraction of neuropil leading to false positives ( events detected when there was activity in the neuropil but not the soma ) and over-subtraction leading to false negatives ( failure to detect somatic activity ) . We examined the effects of r on detection of 1 AP events , with electrical recordings providing ground truth ( Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . For many GCaMP6s neurons , the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve changed little with r ( Figure 2A ) , indicating that APs were detected with few false positives with little effect of neuropil subtraction . Neuropil subtraction exerted a stronger influence on event detection in GCaMP6f neurons , where the ROC curve changed with r ( Figure 2A ) , permitting identification of the optimal r as that which maximized the area under the ROC curve and , thereby , the true/false event detection ratio . Optimal r for Emx1-f and Cux2-f neurons was approximately normally distributed with mean ± SEM of 0 . 82 ± 0 . 07 ( 20 neurons , Figure 2B ) . Our results indicate that the value of r has a modest effect on event detection in GCaMP6f neurons in mouse V1 . The effect of neuropil subtraction may be greater during coordinated activity across the whole network , such as during strong sensory stimuli . After neuropil subtraction ( see 'Materials and methods' ) , we averaged trials by number of APs , fit a sum of exponentials to estimate rise and decay time constants and calculated peak ΔF/F ( mean fluorescence over 100 ms around the maximum within 300 ms for GCaMP6f and 500 ms for GCaMP6s ) for events with 1–5 APs ( Figure 3 ) . 28–55% of detected APs were in events with 1–5 APs ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) and >70% of these analyzed APs were in multi-AP events . As expected , peak ΔF/F increased approximately linearly with 1–5 APs , and peak ΔF/F and decay time constant were greater with GCaMP6s than GCaMP6f ( Figure 3C ) . Peak ΔF/F was comparable to or slightly greater than in previous studies with GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f , possibly because we subtracted more of the neuropil fluorescence with a slightly greater r value ( r = 0 . 8 vs . 0 . 7; Chen et al . , 2013 ) . As expected , photon shot noise was the dominant noise source in images from all mouse lines . The pixelwise slope of the least squares fit between the variance and mean of the photon flux was 1 . 04 ± 0 . 01 ( mean ± SEM ) , consistent with the noise following a Poisson process ( intercept −0 . 08 ± 0 . 2 , 48 neurons ) . Trial-to-trial variability in the amplitude of the 1 AP-evoked fluorescence was substantial and exceeded photon shot noise in most neurons ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . The sources of non-Poisson variability in our results are unclear , but negligible motion was visible in the movies after motion correction . Likely the variability results primarily from trial-to-trial differences in the AP-evoked calcium concentration , assuming GCaMP6f and GCaMP6s are expressed at sufficient concentrations to report resting changes in calcium concentration in all four mouse lines . GCaMP6 indicators have been widely adopted because they exhibit greater AP-evoked ΔF/F than previous GCaMP indicators , but still some APs may go undetected ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) . Under ideal conditions , almost all APs can be detected ( with probability close to 1 at a false positive probability of 1%; Chen et al . , 2013 ) . However , many imaging experiments are performed with a field of view of hundreds of micrometers and this large field of view limits the dwell time per soma and thereby the photon flux per soma and signal-to-noise ratio . What event detection rate might be expected when imaging a large field of view , sufficient to include hundreds of somata ? How much does field of view affect event detection ? We calculated detection probability for 1 AP and 2 AP events , using AP times from electrophysiology recordings to optimize event detection for each neuron ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) . In high spatial and temporal resolution images , the probability of 1 AP event detected spanned a wide range ( probability 0 . 07–1 and 0 . 11–0 . 95 for GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f , at 1% false positive probability , Figure 4A-C ) . As expected ( Dana et al . , 2014; Wei et al . , 2019 ) , most 1 AP events were detected in GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f neurons , but with lower average probability in GCaMP6f neurons ( 1 AP detection probability 0 . 70 ± 0 . 06 for 18 Emx1-s neurons , 0 . 80 ± 0 . 03 for three tetO-s neurons , 0 . 40 ± 0 . 08 for nine Cux2-f neurons , 0 . 60 ± 0 . 08 for 11 Emx1-f neurons , mean ± SEM at 1% false positive probability ) . 2 AP events were reliably detected in all four mouse lines ( Figure 4C; detection probability 0 . 90 ± 0 . 06 for Emx1-s , 1 . 0 ± 0 . 0 for tetO-s , 0 . 66 ± 0 . 07 for Cux2-f , 0 . 80 ± 0 . 05 for Emx1-f , at 1% false positive probability ) . In high spatial and temporal resolution images , in all four mouse lines , it was possible to detect most but by no means all 1 AP and 2 AP events with a false positive probability of only 1% . In these transgenic mice , 1 AP detection probabilities were lower than in previously reported neurons with virally expressed GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f ( 0 . 99 and 0 . 84 at 1% false positive probability in Chen et al . , 2013 ) . There are several possible reasons for this difference . In the transgenic mice used here , GCaMP expression is widespread throughout neocortex , which may result in labeling of greater numbers of axons and dendrites that contribute to the neuropil signal . Furthermore , GCaMP6 expression may be weaker in the four TIGRE1 . 0 mouse line crosses examined here than with strong promoter-driven adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) vectors as used in Chen et al . , 2013 . The newer TIGRE2 . 0 reporter lines drive GCaMP expression that is comparable to that from strong promoter-driven AAVs ( Daigle et al . , 2018 ) , likely enabling 1 AP and 2 AP detection rates in transgenic mice that are comparable to those achieved with viral expression of GCaMP6 . Our recordings were obtained with a small field of view , at a high frame rate and centered on the soma ( ~19 . 3×19 . 3 µm , ~158 Hz , Figure 5A , B ) . In an attempt to simulate commonly used imaging conditions , we downsampled our images in space and time to mimic imaging with a 412 × 412 µm field of view at 30 . 3 Hz , as used in the Allen Brain Observatory ( Figure 5C , D ) . The baseline fluorescence noise from downsampled images was comparable to that in the Allen Brain Observatory ( Figure 5E ) and is presumably comparable to images in many two-photon datasets with populations of hundreds of neurons . As expected , event detection probabilities were lower for downsampled images than for the original , high-resolution images ( Figure 4D–F ) . 1 AP and 2 AP event detection probabilities were 0 . 32 ± 0 . 05 and 0 . 55 ± 0 . 08 for 18 Emx1-s neurons , 0 . 43 ± 0 . 07 and 0 . 89 ± 0 . 06 for three tetO-s neurons , 0 . 16 ± 0 . 04 and 0 . 24 ± 0 . 04 for 9 Cux2-f neurons , 0 . 21 ± 0 . 04 and 0 . 42 ± 0 . 09 for 11 Emx1-f neurons ( mean ± SEM at 1% false positive probability ) . Even for 2 AP events , detection probability is <0 . 5 when imaging with GCaMP6f and a field of view of several hundred micrometers . In summary , 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected with high probability when images were acquired with high spatial and temporal resolution and when analysis was performed with an event detection algorithm optimized for each neuron using known AP times . Even with known AP times to optimize detection for each neuron , event detection was severely impaired by a reduction in spatial and temporal resolution to mimic a typical two-photon population imaging experiment . In a typical two-photon population imaging experiment , no electrophysiology recording is available to optimize event detection . Often , the shape of the calcium transient is estimated from published indicator rise and decay times or derived from a representative sample of fluorescence transients . What are typical event detection and false positive probabilities under these sub-optimal conditions when the underlying AP times are unknown ? Is performance degraded equally for high and for low resolution images ? We compared event detection from high-resolution and downsampled images using three spike inference algorithms: unconstrained non-negative deconvolution ( NND; Friedrich et al . , 2017 ) , non-negative deconvolution with an L0 constraint to enforce event sparseness ( Exact L0; Jewell et al . , 2020 ) , and a biophysical model that explicitly accounts for intracellular calcium dynamics ( MLspike; Deneux et al . , 2016 ) . These three algorithms are among the highest performing spike inference algorithms ( Berens et al . , 2018 ) . For each neuron , the algorithms were deployed to estimate the number of APs in each image of the movie . All three algorithms estimated AP numbers that approximately recapitulated the number of APs measured with electrophysiology , but the number of APs per frame was typically not an integer due to imperfect spike inference ( Figure 6A , D ) . We characterized performance using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Matthews correlation coefficient , which compare measured and estimated AP number at each time point and the presence or absence of an event at each time point , respectively . Pearson correlation coefficients were ~0 . 4 when calculated with 33 ms time bins , increasing toward 0 . 7 as bin size was increased to 500 ms ( Figure 6—figure supplement 1 ) , comparable to published results ( Berens et al . , 2018 ) . Mean Pearson and Matthews correlation coefficients were similar across inference algorithms and mouse lines and differed little between high-resolution and downsampled images ( Figure 6B , E ) . We plot ROC curves to more directly examine the relationship between detected events and false positives . Since spike inference is generally useful only where false positive rates are low , we focused on false positive probabilities in the range of 0–0 . 05 . Performance differed greatly between neurons , but mean ROC curves were similar across mouse lines , with only modest differences between algorithms , between GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f lines , or between high-resolution and downsampled conditions ( Figure 6C , F ) . Naturally , detection probability increased with the number of APs per event . At a false positive probability of 0 . 01 , detection probability was commonly <0 . 1 for 1 AP events , increasing approximately linearly with AP number , often to ~0 . 8 for 5 AP events ( Figure 7A , B ) . With 1 AP events being the most common event type in all four mouse lines ( Figure 7C ) , it was possible to detect only a minority of events with a low false positive probability . Using these spike inference algorithms , although detection probabilities were commonly slightly lower for downsampled than for high-resolution images , the difference was modest , indicating that the decreased SNR of population imaging had little effect on event detection in our dataset . Using our dataset , we compared event detection with three algorithms: unpenalized NND , NND with L0 constraint and mathematically guaranteed globally optimal solution ( Exact L0 ) , and the biophysically inspired MLspike model . For NND , performance was poor at 30 Hz and considerably improved by upsampling to 150 Hz ( Figure 7—figure supplement 1 ) . Upsampling of low frame rate data , often to 100 Hz , is a common practice in the field ( Theis et al . , 2016; Berens et al . , 2018; Pachitariu et al . , 2018 ) . For MLspike , performance was poor without use of the autocalibration procedure to optimize the model for each neuron ( Figure 7—figure supplement 2 ) . MLspike thus contrasted with deconvolution-based algorithms , for which fixed parameters are more effective ( Pachitariu et al . , 2018 ) . For Exact L0 , neither upsampling nor optimization for each neuron was necessary for optimal mean performance across neurons . Pachitariu et al . , 2018 found that unpenalized NND matched and often exceeded the performance of algorithms with sparsifying constraints such as NND with an approximate L0 constraint ( no mathematical guarantee of globally optimal solution ) . Consistent with the conclusions of Pachitariu et al . , 2018 , Exact L0 lagged the performance of NND for some metrics and genotypes ( Figure 7 A , B ) but was indistinguishable or even superior for others ( Figure 6B , E ) . The performance of MLspike was broadly equivalent to that of NND , but the loss of performance due to downsampling was less with MLspike , resulting in outperformance of MLspike on downsampled images . Our results point to MLspike as a compelling choice for spike inference in population imaging experiments . Our results also suggest that there is ample room for improvement of spike inference models since event detection by the three spike inference models falls far short of the performance of the ground truth-optimized approach employed in Figure 4 ( Figure 7—figure supplement 3 ) . In summary , relative to small field-of-view imaging , population imaging conditions decreased the probability of spike event detection with an event detector optimized to each individual neuron using ground truth AP information ( Figure 4 ) . With blind spike inference , many events went undetected even under near-ideal imaging conditions with a small field of view , and event detection was not substantially worse under population imaging conditions ( Figure 6 , Figure 7 , Figure 7—figure supplement 3 ) . The results of Figures 6 and 7 are likely representative of event detection in many GCaMP6 imaging experiments , where ground truth AP information is not available and blind spike inference is employed . Our results indicate that even though GCaMP6 indicators are bright and sensitive enough to enable the detection of most 1 AP events in superficial cortical pyramidal neurons in vivo if the detection procedure is optimized using ground truth AP information , most events containing 1 , 2 , and sometimes greater numbers of APs go undetected in our ( and likely in many other ) imaging experiments with GCaMP6 . 
 Calcium imaging is widely used to report neuronal spiking activity in vivo . However , accurate spike inference from calcium imaging remains a challenge , and there are relatively few ground truth datasets with simultaneous calcium imaging and electrophysiology to aid the development of more accurate spike inference algorithms . In a recent challenge , ~40 algorithms were trained and tested on datasets consisting of 37 GCaMP6-expressing neurons , underscoring the need for additional GCaMP6 calibration data ( Berens et al . , 2018 ) . In addition to supporting efforts toward spike inference , an improved understanding of the relationship between spiking and observed fluorescence signals is necessary to further broaden the utility and impact of calcium imaging . To these ends , we contribute a ground truth dataset consisting of 48 V1 L2/3 excitatory neurons recorded at single-cell resolution ( available at https://portal . brain-map . org/explore/circuits/oephys ) and characterized their AP-to-calcium fluorescence transfer function . Complementing existing datasets with viral GECI expression ( Chen et al . , 2013; Theis et al . , 2016; Dana et al . , 2016 ) , our work facilitates interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging studies using mainstream transgenic mouse lines , such as the Allen Institute’s Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset ( http://observatory . brain-map . org/visualcoding ) ( de Vries et al . , 2020 ) . Previous studies have established that most APs can be detected with GCaMP6 indicators under near-optimal conditions ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) . Yet undetected APs are common in population imaging experiments ( Theis et al . , 2016; Berens et al . , 2018 ) . To investigate why APs are often missed during population imaging , we compared event detection in 250 ms time windows with a neuronal soma occupying most of the image , near-optimal conditions for AP event detection , and event detection when the soma occupies just a small percentage of the field of view , less ideal conditions that are common in population imaging studies . Importantly , we downsampled images to simulate population imaging conditions , enabling comparison for the same APs under different imaging conditions . Our results indicate that , in GCaMP6 transgenic mice , most APs can be detected under near-optimal conditions , while detection is less effective during population imaging . These conclusions are similar to those of previous studies with viral GCaMP6 expression , but our results also reveal two reasons for the difference in detection . Unsurprisingly , the reduced signal-to-noise ratio of population imaging , relative to single soma imaging , results in less effective event detection . However , a high signal-to-noise ratio , achieved by imaging one soma , was no guarantee of effective event detection . Effective detection also required optimization of detection for the neuron of interest , using known AP times to identify events with different AP numbers and so generate kernels of the appropriate amplitude and time course . Parameter tuning in the absence of known AP times , with the MLspike autocalibration routine , improved event detection but not to the high standard of ground truth-optimized detection . Unfortunately , measuring AP times for every neuron with electrophysiology is rarely feasible , severely limiting the percentage of events one might reasonably expect to detect with GCaMP6 in most imaging experiments . Our results point to several practices that might be adopted to maximize spike detection . First , minimize the field of view , hence maximizing photon flux per neuron . Second , tune the spike inference model for each neuron independently , where possible . Third , compare the results of several spike inference models . The three models employed here produced similar AP detection rates , whether applied to high-resolution or to downsampled images . Similarly , Pachitariu et al . , 2018 observed that the L0 constraint failed to improve performance of the NND model . Nonetheless , each model has strengths and weaknesses . For example , a model may detect more APs than another but at the cost of a greater false positive rate . As a result , model performance may diverge for some AP rates and patterns . In the worst case , comparing models provides some protection from errors in implementation . Fourth , ensure that traces are sampled ( or upsampled ) at a sufficiently high rate when employing NND and use autocalibration with MLspike; both make a substantial difference to model performance . Finally , exercise caution when interpreting the inferred spike rates . Commonly , many APs are not detected using even the most accurate spike inference models . In summary , in this study we present a ground truth dataset from anesthetized mice with simultaneous electrophysiology and calcium imaging . Analysis of this dataset revealed that only a small fraction of isolated APs were detected under typical population imaging conditions and with existing spike inference algorithms . By making our data freely available , we hope that it will serve the community as a further resource to better understand the quantitative link between calcium-evoked fluorescent imaging signals and spiking activity . 
 Two-photon-targeted electrophysiology and two-photon calcium imaging were conducted in 2- to 5-month-old male and female transgenic mice: five Emx1-IRES-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai94 ( Emx1-s ) mice , one Camk2a-tTA;tetO-GCaMP6s ( tetO-s ) mouse , three Emx1-IRES-Cre;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 ( Emx1-f ) mice , and four Cux2-CreERT2;Camk2a-tTA;Ai93 ( Cux2-f ) mice . All four lines drive GCaMP expression primarily in excitatory neurons . In Cux2-CreERT2 mice , Cre and GCaMP expression are enriched in layer 2/3 ( Franco et al . , 2012; Harris et al . , 2014 ) . In Emx1-IRES-Cre and Camk2a-tTA mice , GCaMP is expressed throughout cortical layers ( Gorski et al . , 2002; Wekselblatt et al . , 2016 ) . Images showing the pattern of Cre and GCaMP expression in these mouse lines are available via the Transgenic Characterization pages of the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas and Allen Brain Observatory: https://connectivity . brain-map . org/transgenic , http://observatory . brain-map . org/visualcoding/transgenic . Mice of some of the genotypes used here , most notably Emx1-f , can exhibit epileptiform activity ( Steinmetz et al . , 2017 ) , including overt seizures . Mice with seizures were excluded from the study . However , the spiking patterns of neurons from GCaMP6s and -f lines commonly differed , suggesting that one or more transgenes affected cell or circuit activity ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C ) . Mice were anesthetized with either isoflurane ( 0 . 75–1 . 5% in O2 ) or urethane ( 1 . 5 g/kg , 30% aqueous solution , intraperitoneal injection ) , then implanted with a metal head-post . A circular craniotomy was performed with skull thinning over the left V1 centering on 1 . 3 mm anterior and 2 . 6 mm lateral to the lambda . During surgery , the craniotomy was filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( ACSF ) containing ( in mM ) : NaCl 126 , KCl 2 . 5 , NaH2PO4 1 . 25 , MgCl2 1 , NaHCO3 26 , glucose 10 , CaCl2 2 , in ddH2O; 290 mOsm; pH was adjusted to 7 . 3 with NaOH to keep the exposed V1 region from overheating or drying . Durotomy was performed to expose V1 regions of interest ( ROIs ) that were free of major blood vessels to facilitate the penetration of recording micropipettes . A thin layer of low-melting-point agarose ( 1–1 . 3% in ACSF , Sigma-Aldrich ) was then applied to the craniotomy to control brain motion . The mouse body temperature was maintained at 37°C with a feedback-controlled animal heating pad ( Harvard Apparatus ) . Individual GCaMP6+ neurons ~100–300 µm below the pial surface of cortex were visualized under adequate anesthesia ( stage III-3 ) using a Bruker ( Prairie ) two-photon microscope and Chameleon Ultra II Ti:sapphire laser ( Coherent ) . Fluorescence excited at 920 nm wavelength , with <70 mW laser power measured after the objective , was collected in two spectral channels using green ( 510/42 nm ) and red ( 641/75 nm ) emission filters ( Semrock ) to visualize GCaMP6 and the Alexa Fluor 594-containing micropipette , respectively . Fluorescence images of 96–136 × 96–107 pixels and a 19 . 3–27 . 3 × 19 . 3–21 . 5 µm field of view were acquired at 141 . 3–158 frames per second through a 16× water immersion objective lens ( Nikon , NA 0 . 8 ) . Recordings included periods with and without visual stimuli . Mean ± SEM number of pixels per neuron was 1136 ± 46 . Two-photon-targeted cell-attached recording was performed following established protocols ( Margrie et al . , 2003; Kitamura et al . , 2008; Knoblich et al . , 2019 ) . Long-shank borosilicate ( KG-33 , King Precision Glass ) micropipettes ( 5–10 MΩ ) were pulled with a P-97 puller ( Sutter ) and filled with ACSF and Alexa Fluor 594 to perform cell-attached recordings on GCaMP6+ neurons . Micropipettes were installed on a MultiClamp 700B headstage ( Molecular Devices ) , which was mounted onto a Patchstar micromanipulator ( Scientifica ) with an approaching angle of 31° from horizontal plane . Minimal seal resistance was 20 MΩ . Data were acquired under ‘I = 0’ mode ( zero current injection ) with a Multiclamp 700B , recorded at 40 kHz using Multifunction I/O Devices ( National Instruments ) and custom software written in LabVIEW ( National Instruments ) and MATLAB ( MathWorks ) . Isoflurane level was intentionally adjusted during recording sessions to keep the anesthesia depth as light as possible , resulting in fluctuation of the firing rates of recorded neurons . Whole-screen sinusoidal static and drifting gratings were presented on a calibrated LCD monitor spanning 60° in elevation and 130° in azimuth to the contralateral eye . The mouse’s eye was positioned ~22 cm away from the center of the monitor . For static gratings , the stimulus consisted of four orientations ( 45° increment ) , four spatial frequencies ( 0 . 02 , 0 . 04 , 0 . 08 , and 0 . 16 cycles per degree ) , and four phases ( 0 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 ) at 80% contrast in a random sequence with 10 repetitions . Each static grating was presented for 0 . 25 s , with no inter-stimulus interval . A gray screen at mean illuminance was presented randomly a total of 60 times . For drifting gratings , the stimulus consisted of eight orientations ( 45° increment ) , four spatial frequency ( 0 . 02 , 0 . 04 , 0 . 08 , and 0 . 16 cycles per degree ) , and one temporal frequency ( 2 Hz ) , at 80% contrast in a random sequence with up to five repetitions . Each drifting grating lasted for 2 s with an inter-stimulus interval of 2 s . A gray screen at mean illuminance was presented randomly for up to 15 times . We obtained recordings from 213 neurons and developed a numerical routine to exclude neurons with questionable electrophysiology or fluorescence movies , such as abrupt changes in baseline voltage or AP waveform or image artifacts such as those due to motion , photobleaching , or other slow baseline changes . Neurons were accepted for analysis if they passed both electrophysiology and image quality control criteria . Electrophysiology quality control is described in the next section and imaging quality control in the ‘Image downsampling’ section; 145 and 10 neurons were eliminated in the electrophysiology and image quality control steps , leaving 58 neurons . Of these , 10 were excluded from further analysis: red indicator had entered the soma from the pipette in seven instances , two neurons segmented poorly during image analysis , and one had a truncated electrophysiology recording . The final dataset consisted of 48 neurons . Electrophysiology traces were first baseline-subtracted to remove slow drift ( third-order Savitzky-Golay filter over 20 , 001 samples using MATLAB sgolayfilt ) . APs were detected as peaks of amplitude more than 10 times the Quiroga threshold ( QT ) , the median ( |V ( t ) |/0 . 6745 ) . To develop a numerical routine , a group of human annotators identified 48 ‘high-quality’ electrophysiology recordings . We then compiled a large set of descriptive statistics , listed below , and calculated the distribution of each of these statistics in the reference dataset , thereby defining an acceptable range expected of high-quality recordings . Each descriptive statistic was subsequently computed for recordings from all 213 neurons . Each recording was passed for further analysis if for all metrics it fell within the range spanned by the manually selected dataset of 48 recordings . For each electrophysiology recording , we calculated 35 descriptive statistics . Metrics computed on continuous electrophysiological data: ( 1 ) Median relative deviation of the membrane potential ( MRDM ) , the ratio between the median absolute deviation ( MAD ) and the median: MRDM = MAD ( Vm ) /median ( Vm ) . ( 2 ) Mean of the baseline ( BL ) . ( 3 ) Coefficient of variation of the baseline: std ( BL ) /mean ( BL ) . ( 4 ) Mean of the baseline noise , approximated by the QT ( Jewell et al . , 2020 ) . ( 5 ) Stability of the QT: thousand 10 s intervals were uniformly sampled from each recording , and the QT was computed on each sample . Quiroga noise stability ( QNS ) was defined as the coefficient of variation over the 1000 QT samples . ( 6 ) r2 of linear regression ( MATLAB regression function ) of the 1000 QT samples against the start times of the 10 s segments on which the QT was computed . ( 7 ) Slope of linear regression ( MATLAB regression function ) of the 1000 QT samples against the start times of the 10 s segments on which the QT was computed . ( 8 ) r2 of linear regression ( MATLAB regression function ) of the baseline against time . ( 9 ) Slope of linear regression ( MATLAB regression function ) of the baseline against time . ( 10 ) The number of samples for which the baseline-subtracted trace exceeds the QT divided by the number of samples for which it dips below the negative of the QT . Metrics computed on the AP time series . Only recordings with >3 APs were included: ( 11 ) Number of APs . ( 12 ) Maximum likelihood inter-AP interval ( MATLAB lognfit function ) . ( 13 ) Mean AP amplitude . ( 14 ) AP amplitude coefficient of variation . ( 15 ) AP amplitude median relative deviation . ( 16 ) Relative AP amplitude range: ( max[amplitude] – min[amplitude] ) /median ( amplitude ) . ( 17 ) AP amplitude max/min ratio: max ( amplitude ) /min ( amplitude ) . ( 18 ) Signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) , median ( amplitude ) /QT . Metrics computed on 2-ms-long AP waveforms , AP time ±1 ms smoothed with MATLAB smooth function with sgolay option: ( 19 ) 'Left' width-half-max ( LWHM ) , the mean width at half the amplitude before the detected AP time . ( 20 ) 'Right' width-half-max ( RWHM ) , the mean width at half the amplitude after the detected AP time . ( 21 ) Full width at half amplitude ( FWHM ) . FWHM = LWHM + RWHM . ( 22 ) Coefficient of variation of LWHM . ( 23 ) Coefficient of variation of RWHM . ( 24 ) Coefficient of variation of FWHM . ( 25 ) r2 of linear regression ( MATLAB regression function ) of AP amplitude against AP time . ( 26 ) Slope of linear regression ( MATLAB regression function ) of AP amplitude against AP time . ( 27 ) r2 of linear regression ( MATLAB regression function ) of AP FWHM against AP time . ( 28 ) Slope of linear regression ( MATLAB regression function ) of AP FWHM against AP time . Firing rate-based metrics . Firing rate was estimated by convolution of the AP train with a 1-s-long box-car window ( MATLAB conv function ) : ( 29 ) Mean firing rate ( FR ) . ( 30 ) Coefficient of variation of FR . ( 31 ) r2 of linear regression ( MATLAB regression function ) of firing rate against time . ( 32 ) Slope of linear regression ( MATLAB regression function ) of firing rate against time . ( 33 ) Pearson correlation ( MATLAB corrcoef function ) of BL vs . FR . ( 34 ) Pearson correlation ( MATLAB corrcoef function ) between the baseline at AP time points and AP amplitude . ( 35 ) Pearson correlation ( MATLAB corrcoef function ) between the baseline at AP times and the AP FWHM . To approximate somatic fluorescence ( Fcell_true ) without neuropil contamination , a scale version of the neuropil fluorescence ( Fneuropil ) was subtracted from each somatic fluorescence trace , after ( Akerboom et al . , 2012 ) : Fcell_true ( t ) = Fcell_measured ( t ) – r * Fneuropil ( t ) . We determined the optimal scale factor ( r ) for neurons with GCaMP6f to be 0 . 82 ( see 'Results' section ) . We therefore used r = 0 . 8 as our default scale factor . For some neurons , Fneuropil was large enough relative to Fcell_measured that r = 0 . 8 resulted in negative fluorescence . For these neurons , we set r to 0 . 7 , 0 . 6 , or 0 . 5 . For our dataset of 48 GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f neurons , we set r to 0 . 8 for 40 neurons , to 0 . 7 for four neurons , to 0 . 6 for three neurons , and to 0 . 5 for one neuron . Neuropil subtraction was performed as described for the Allen Brain Observatory ( de Vries et al . , 2020 ) . Electrophysiology and calcium imaging data were analyzed using custom MATLAB and Python scripts . For electrophysiology , Vm was filtered between 250 Hz and 5 kHz , and automated AP detection was performed using a threshold criterion ( 5×std of Vm ) . For calcium imaging , in-plane motion artifacts were corrected ( Dombeck et al . , 2007 ) , and neuron/ROI selection was performed using a semi-automatic algorithm ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) ( kindly provided by Karel Svoboda , Janelia Research Campus ) . Ring-shaped ROIs were used to select GCaMP6-positive excitatory neurons , with GCaMP6 expression typically excluded from the nucleus and restricted to the cytoplasm . To construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves , we first identified all isolated AP events . For GCaMP6s , isolated events were separated from previous and subsequent events by ≥1000 and ≥500 ms , respectively . For GCaMP6f , isolated events were separated from previous and subsequent events by ≥300 ms . One result of finding isolated events is that only a minority of APs were used to construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves . Within each event , APs were summed over 250 ms . Fluorescence traces were aligned to the first AP in each event , with t = 0 preceding the AP by <1 frame ( 6 . 3 ms at 158 Hz ) . For each event , ΔF/F = ( F-F0 , local ) /F0 , global , where F0 , local was the mean fluorescence over 100 ms before the first AP , and F0 , global was the minimum F0 , local across trials . For GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f , peak ΔF/F was calculated by first finding tmax , the time of the maximum ΔF/F ≤ 500 ms and 300 ms after the first AP , respectively . Peak ΔF/F was the mean ΔF/F from tmax - 50 ms to tmax + 50 ms . Bursts of >5 APs were excluded from analysis due to the low frequency of such events . Mean and variance of the fluorescence , calculated pixelwise for each image , were linearly related , consistent with shot noise-limited imaging . The resulting slope and offset of the least squares fit were used to convert fluorescence to number of photons: photons = ( F – [–offset/slope] ) /slope ( http://github . com/AllenInstitute/QC_2P ) . To account for different pixel dwell times along the resonant scanning axis , photon gain and offset were computed pixel-by-pixel along the resonant axis . For each neuron , fluorescence was summed over all somatic pixels and converted to photons . For each 1 AP event , mean photon count 0 . 1–0 s before the AP was subtracted . tmax , the time of the maximum photon count , was calculated from the mean 1 AP trace . Photon count in each trial was determined at tmax , and the 95% confidence interval was calculated as mean ( across trials ) ±1 . 96 * mean peak . The percentage of trials with peak fluorescence outside the 95% confidence interval was used as a measure of trial-to-trial variability . We compared fluorescence traces of the response ( 1 AP or 2 AP events ) to that of 0 AP events ( Chen et al . , 2013 ) . For each recording , the mean response trace was used as the template vector . The template vector was normalized after subtracting the mean to create the unit vector , and the scalar results of projecting the response and noise traces on the unit vector were computed: ri and ni for response and noise scalars , respectively . The detection threshold was defined as the xth percentile of ni values , where 1–x represented the false positive probability ( e . g . x = 95 for 95th percentile or 5% false positive probability ) , and the detection probability ( true positive probability ) was the fraction of ri values above the detection threshold . Fluorescence movies were sub-sampled by a factor of 4 in space and 5 in time ( to pixel size 0 . 80 µm and frame rate 30 . 3 Hz ) to match the sampling rate and approximate number of pixels per soma of the Allen Brain Observatory ( de Vries et al . , 2020 ) . To assess the effect of downsampling on subsequent processing , 20 different approaches were tried in parallel ( downsampling starting with the 1st , 2nd , … , 4th pixel × 1st , 2nd , … , 5th frame , respectively ) . 4 × 5 internally identical blocks , one block for each downsampling strategy , were tiled for a total of 400 almost identical ROIs per recording . Segmentation to find somatic ROIs , demixing of traces from nearby somata , neuropil subtraction , and the calculation of ΔF/F were performed as described for the Allen Brain Observatory ( de Vries et al . , 2020 ) . In cases where only the neuron of interest was found during segmentation , trace extraction would yield a family of 400 self-similar traces and the median was used for subsequent analysis . To catch cases where segmentation yielded additional objects that were not part of the neuron of interest , additional QC steps were required . The traces were first clustered using DBSCAN ( Ester et al . , 1996; Schubert et al . , 2017 ) , and each cluster median was compared against white noise of the same mean and standard deviation ( KS test ) and rejected as artifact if it was not significantly different ( p<0 . 05 ) . In cases where multiple clusters were significantly different from noise , this was either due to multiple neurons being present in the field of view or due to residual motion artifacts resulting in multiple translated copies of the same neuron . To disambiguate these two possibilities , the top three clusters were merged: sums were computed for all six possible combinations ( sampled without replacement ) of ( up to ) three most distinct cluster medians , and the combination most significantly correlated with the measured electrophysiological AP train was selected for subsequent analysis . Correlation significance was determined by building a null distribution of correlations between the cluster medians and 1000 random Poisson trains with a rate matching that of the recorded AP train . If there was no more significant correlation between any cluster median ( or sum thereof ) and the measured AP train than the 0 . 5th percentile of the null distribution ( i . e . p>0 . 005 ) , the recording was failed . Finally , we eliminated from further analysis <10 neurons with an abrupt and sustained ( seconds ) rise in spike rate and subsequent loss spiking activity out of concern that this activity pattern might indicate a breached plasma membrane . To compare the noise characteristics of the downsampled images to the Allen Brain Observatory , we computed the robust standard deviation , a median-based method with outlier removal ( de Vries et al . , 2020 ) . For the Allen Brain Observatory , we analyzed fluorescence over periods in which there were no apparent AP-evoked changes in fluorescence .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['tools and resources', 'neuroscience']",elife-51675-v3,152,7603,7451,50.01973684210526
144," Summary of Findings and Implications  This research describes the functional switching valve within the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla. The valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. Females have a penis-like intromittent organ to coercisively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule, whose formation is initiated by seminal injection. The valve complex has two slots for insemination, allowing Neotrogla to continue mating while the first slot is occupied.  Key Findings:   The switching valve mechanism is located at the spermathecal plate.  The valve allows females to control the direction of seminal flow.  The presence of the spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow may further refine our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus.  The switching valve system reported here likely represents an adaptation for direct benefits rather than for genetic benefits.  Implications:   The evolution of the switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla.  The switching valve allows females to obtain more nutrition from a male.  The switching valve could be a valuable tool for understanding the evolution of female reproductive organs and the mechanisms underlying sex-role reversal.  Overall, this research provides a detailed description of the functional switching valve within the female genitalia of Neotrogla, highlighting its significance in the evolution of the genus and its potential for further scientific investigation.","In dry caves of southeastern Brazil , live a group of insects named Neotrogla that are perhaps best known because the egg-producing females have penises while the sperm-producing males have vaginas . The sex roles of these Brazilian cave insects are also reversed: females compete over the males , who in turn are selective of their female partners . This sex role reversal likely evolved within Neotrogla because the males’ semen represents a rich and reliable source of energy within a nutrient-poor cave environment . When females are not using semen to fertilize their eggs , they consume it . Yet , while other animals show sex role reversal , Neotrogla species alone have reversed sexual organs . Neotrogla penises are spiky and may have evolved so that females can anchor themselves to males and then mate for prolonged periods . This would allow the females to stock up on the nutritious semen . Compared to their closest relatives , Neotrogla species can hold twice as much semen within their sperm storage organs . Scientists have speculated that a valve-like structure within this organ enables this extra storage by allowing the female to redirect semen into two separate chambers . But the organ’s small size has made it difficult to determine its inner workings , and scientists have yet to discover a switching valve that serves such a purpose within the animal kingdom . Yoshizawa et al . examined three Neotrogla species using advanced imaging technology and detected the first example of a biological switching valve . Neotrogla females can control this valve , switching the flow of semen between two slots . In this way , females can store two batches of semen at once . Seemingly exploiting this adaptation , the females’ spiky penises help them restrain males until they have received multiple semen injections . Yoshizawa et al . therefore suggest the emergence of this valve within the sperm storage organ may have promoted the evolution of the female penis . Along with giving insight into the lives of cave insects , these findings are of interest to engineers , who face challenges when constructing valves on a microscopic scale . The unique switching valve of female Neotrogla may one day inspire new man-made machinery that could advance a range of industries .","We report a functional switching valve within the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla .

The valve complex has two slots for insemination so that Neotrogla can continue mating while the first slot is occupied . In conjunction with the female penis , this switching valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections . The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla . 
 Many man-made engineering solutions have evolved already in insects . Such examples include hinges ( flapping flight enabled by the wing base: Brodsky , 1994 ) , on-off valves ( spiracle openings to regulate airflow: Chapman , 1998 ) , backflow valves ( the bombardier beetle's defensive spray: Arndt et al . , 2015 ) , coiling mechanisms ( genital tubes: Matsumura et al . , 2017a ) or catapult-like mechanisms ( the legs of many jumping insects: Burrows , 2013 ) . Some mechanisms that were formerly thought to be unique to human engineering have been discovered recently in insects: biological screws have been found in a beetle's leg ( van de Kamp et al . , 2011 ) , and interacting gears were found in the jumping legs of planthoppers ( Burrows and Sutton , 2013 ) . The design and construction of such mechanisms on a micrometer scale is a challenging task in engineering ( Feinberg et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , studies of micron-scale biological structures can be rewarding as they illuminate construction principles in insects that could be applied to technical solutions in engineering ( Matsumura et al . , 2017b ) . The genus Neotrogla ( family Prionoglarididae ) is a minute Brazilian cave insect belonging to the order Psocodea ( booklice , barklice , and parasitic lice ) . This genus is of special evolutionary and morphological interest because of the reversal in its genital structures ( Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . The females of Neotrogla have a penis-like intromittent organ ( gynosome: Figure 1A ) , which is inserted to a male vagina-like genital cavity for copulation . During mating , the male injects liquid semen into the female’s sperm storage organ ( spermatheca ) through the opening of the spermathcal duct at the tip of the female penis . Within the spermatheca , the injected semen then induces the formation of a hard capsule shell around itself ( Figure 1A , B: Wearing-Wilde ( 1995 ) ; Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . Although there is only a single inlet spermathecal duct present , occasionally two seminal capsules are attached simultaneously to a plate-like structure on the spermatheca ( termed ‘spermathecal plate’: [Lienhard et al . , 1893; Yoshizawa et al . , 2014] ) . The semen within the capsule is used not only for fertilization but is also consumed by the female as nutrition . To compete for nutritious semen , the direction of sexual selection is reversed in Neotrogla ( sex-role reversal: Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . Each seminal capsule is voluminous ( ~0 . 05 mm3 , corresponding to ~300 ml scaled up to humans ) , and the duration of the copulation is very long ( for 40 to 70 hr ) . In a closely related species lacking reversal of genital structure ( Lepinotus patruelis , Trogiidae ) , the seminal transfer for forming a similarly voluminous seminal capsule is known to complete in 50 min ( Wearing-Wilde , 1995 ) . The female penis of Neotrogla bears a lot of spines , by which females anchor a male coercively during copulation . Therefore , females are obviously responsible for this very long copulation , probably to obtain more semen from a male ( Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . After consumption of the semen , the empty capsule is detached from the plate , which is kept within the spermatheca . Because females frequently have empty capsules within the spermathecal pouch ( in an extreme case , up to nine empty capsules and two filled ones attached to the plate were observed: Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) , female Neotrogla can be considered polyandrous , which is apparently controlled actively by the female . Although several examples of sex-role reversed animals induced by seminal gifting have been reported , Neotrogla so far is the only example with a morphological reversal of its intromittent organs ( Kamimura and Yoshizawa , 2017 ) . This morphological reversal seems to require further upstream modifications of the genital system , such as the formation of the spermathecal plate , which was reported as an additional novelty tightly associated with the seminal gifting ( Lienhard et al . , 1893; Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . However , the detailed morphology and function of this spermathecal plate , which presumably plays an important role in the evolution of the female penis , remained unclear due to the extremely small size of the involved subcomponents and their fragile spatial composition . In this study , we investigated the structure of the spermathecal plate by using a combination of confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) and high-resolution synchrotron microcomputed tomography ( HR-µCT ) to assess the functional morphology of sperm storage and control of seminal flow . We examined three species of Neotrogla ( N . brasiliensis , N . aurora and N . truncata ) , the spermathecal morphology of which is practically identical ( Lienhard et al . , 1893 ) . Based on the results , we discuss the evolutionary significance of this plate during the evolution of the reversed intromittent organs in Neotrogla . 
 The spermatheca of Neotrogla is in principle composed of an extensible pouch for storage of the seminal capsule , a spermathecal plate divided into two interconnected sclerites ( body sclerites 1 and 2: Sc1 and 2 hereafter ) , and the spermathecal duct , which discharges into the spermathecal plate ( Figure 1CD , Video 1 ) . The terminology used for the following description is summarized in Table 1 . The switching valve mechanism is located at the spermathecal plate . Sc 2 is a bowl-shaped chitinous structure harboring a fan-like muscle ( the actuator ) , which originates at its ventral part and attaches to a thumb-shaped controller/closure element ( CE: Figures 1CD and 2A–D ) . Given their attachment area , the force range of each muscle bundle is between 0 . 0758–0 . 6562 mN ( assuming a standard intrinsic muscle force of 33 N/cm²: David et al . , 2016 ) . The CE is located at the dorsal connection of Sc1 and 2 , where the spermathecal duct opens into the pouch ( Figure 2A–D ) . In the virgin female , Sc 2 is connected to Sc 1 laterally through an interlock-like structure composed of several ridges on both sides that fit into each other ( Figure 1F ) . This is the location where seminal capsules are formed during copulation ( Figure 1G ) . Both Sc1 and Sc2 possess a system of patches of resilin , a rubber-like protein found in arthropod cuticles wherever potential energy is stored for spring-like motions or bending of structures . The region surrounding the CE contains extensive resilin patches ( Figures 1CD and 2 ) . Two larger patches are located where the seminal capsules are attached so that this region can expand to harbor the base of the seminal capsule ( Figure 1DF ) . Another resilin-rich region is located around the valve mechanism ( Figures 1CD and 2 ) , where the resilin serves to passively keep the valve opening in the closed position . Opening of the valve can only occur through activation of the actuator muscle bundle . In the fixed material analyzed , the muscle bundles are contracted due to the fixation process . Therefore , the switching valve is in an opened position in Figures 1–2 . The seminal fluid entering the main lumen of the duct can be directed into the left or right channel depending on the position of the CE . If the left part of the actuator muscle is activated , the CE is moved to the left , so that a channel on the right side opens , which then allows for seminal flow into the right capsule ( Figure 2E ) . A small lateral extension at the distal end of the CE serves to close the opposite channel during the opening of the other channel ( Figure 2DE ) . If the right part of the actuator is activated , the process is executed in reverse . In a female fixed during copula , seminal flow from the duct opening lumen toward one of two seminal capsules was clearly observed ( Figure 1E ) . Seminal flow can thus be directed by the female through differential muscle activation that moves the CE . Measurements of each structure and the estimated power produced by the discernible muscle bundles mentioned above are summarized in Table 2 . 
 The present analyses show that females of Neotrogla use a special mechanism to actively control the direction of seminal flow ( Figures 1E and 2A–D ) . This biological switching valve allows females to receive two seminal packages ( i . e . , more nutrition ) from the same or different males within a short time span . In particular , the switching valve allows to receive a second seminal capsule while the first one is consumed . A similar but less sclerotized structure can be observed in close relatives of Neotrogla ( Sensitibilla and Afrotrogla , all belonging to the tribe Sensitibillini ) , suggesting that the structure probably originated in their common ancestor ( Lienhard , 1893; Lienhard et al . , 1893 ) . Neotrogla is distributed in South America , whereas Sensitibilla and Afrotrogla are distributed in southern Africa . Therefore , the origin of this switching valve dates to at least the break-up of the two continents , over 100 million years ago ( Seton et al . , 2012 ) . In other psocodeans , no sclerite or muscle corresponding to those of the spermathecal plate elements have been observed ( Badonnel , 1934; Klier , 1956; Wearing-Wilde , 1995 ) . The spermathecal plate thus clearly represents an evolutionary novelty ( Müller and Wagner , 2003 ) . The mechanism of flow control and redirection within this biological switching valve is fundamentally different from that in man-made switching valves , which are used , for example in the oil and gas industry . Technical switching valves use the active rotation of tube or ball elements with various openings to redirect the flow and both closing as well as opening involve an active movement of the valve . In contrast , the observed biological switching valve involves a passive movement component . The seminal flow injected by a male is redirected by a differential inclination of the CE ( Figure 2E ) . This inclination is due to the fan-like geometry of the actuator muscle whose parts can pull the CE in the preferred direction to work against the passive closing forces generated by the resilin patches around the valve complex . This muscle-closure element configuration could be advantageous since each muscle bundle pulls in an optimal direction to incline the CE into one of the two opening positions . Additionally , there is no need for lubrication since the moveable parts do not move against each other . Compared to technical switching valves , this design is advantageous to some extent because the muscle forces are not redirected via a lever arm . The presence of a spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow may further refine our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus . Female-female competition for males ( sex-role reversal ) to receive nutritious seminal substances is considered as the most important factor driving the evolution of the female penis ( Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . Among all animals with known sex-role reversal , Neotrogla is the only example in which a female penis evolved ( Kamimura and Yoshizawa , 2017 ) . In a close relative of Neotrogla , the barklouse species Lepinotus patruelis ( Wearing-Wilde , 1996 ) , the sex-roles are also reversed , but the species possesses normal genital structures . Therefore , it is very likely that , in addition to the sex-role reversal , there is at least one other key factor that enabled the evolution of a female penis . Although females of all three known genera of Sensitibillini possess a spermathecal plate , females of Sensitibilla do not have a penis-like organ ( Lienhard , 1893; Lienhard et al . , 1893 ) . This strongly suggests that the evolution of the spermathecal plate , possibly including a switching valve , preceded the evolution of the female penis . The spermathcal plate has two slots available for insemination ( Figure 1E ) . In Neotrogla and the related species ( Lepinotus ) , content of the capsule is digested as nutrition during the seminal capsule being attached to the spermathecal plate ( the transparent capsule shown in Figure 1B is a digested and empty one: Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , if there is only one slot for insemination , as in the spermatheca of Lepinotus , females cannot receive another capsule while digesting one . With the switching valve , the female Neotrogla ( and possibly Sensitibilla and Afrotrogla ) can selectively use one of two slots for insemination , with leaving the other slot empty . This enables the females to immediately receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males by using the empty slot . Males are predicted to prudently allocate limited resources , such as nutritious seminal gifts and sperm , to multiple females , especially when operational sex ratio is biased to females , rendering female-female competition for male-derived nuptial gifts ( i . e , propensity for multiple mating ) more intense ( Abe and Kamimura , 2015 ) . The male-holding organ ( spiny female penis ) and female-induced long copulation durations of 40 – 70 hr ( compared to just ~50 min for formation of one seminal capsule in close relatives ) in Neotrogla ( Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) thus can be considered as exaggerated adaptations for such escalated competition for nuptial gifts in this group of insects inhabiting highly oligotrophic cave habitats ( Lienhard and Ferreira , 2013; Lienhard and Ferreira , 2015; Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . The condition of having two freshly deposited spermatophores at once is comparable to that in multiple sperm storage organs reported for females of some animal groups , such as dung flies , Drosophila , or tephritid fruit flies ( Ward , 1993; Pitnick et al . , 1999; Twig and Yuval , 2005 ) . Although theory predicts that having multiple sperm stores can be a powerful mechanism for choosing sperm ( Hellriegel and Ward , 1998 ) , evidence is scarce for a gain in fitness by actively selecting for particular sperm from among multiple mates ( e . g . , Demont et al . , 2012; Schäfer et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , in the case of Neotrogla and related barklice ( Lepinotus patruelis ) , the content of the seminal capsule is digested quite rapidly if not used for fertilization ( Wearing-Wilde , 1995; Yoshizawa et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , the switching valve system reported here likely represents an adaptation for direct benefits ( i . e . , for obtaining more nutrients ) rather than for genetic benefits ( i . e . , for choosing sperm from high-quality males ) . 
 Three species of Neotrogla were examined . We detected little interspecific variation in the basic mechanism of the spermathecal plate . A virgin female of Neotrogla brasiliensis ( Caboclo Cave , Januária , Minas Gerais , Brazil , 12 . iii . 2016: Figures 1DF and 2A–C: voucher ID S8KY03 ) and a copulating pair of N . truncata ( Toca dos Ossos Cave , Ourolândia , Bahia , Brazil , 14 . i . 2013: Figure 1EG: voucher ID S8KY69: full shape data provided as Video 1 ) were used for µCT examination ( http://dx . doi . org/10 . 6084/m9 . figshare . 6741857 ) . Neotrogla brasiliensis was fixed with FAA solution ( formaldehyde-acetic acid-alcohol ) and N . truncata was fixed with 80% ethanol . Both samples were then stored in 80% ethanol . Dehydration was conducted in ascending order with 80 – 100% ethanol before drying them at the critical point ( EM CPD300 , Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) to remove water without serious organ shrinkage . Samples were then scanned using synchrotron microcomputed tomography at the BL47XU ( Uesugi and Hoshino , 2012 ) beamline of the Super Photon ring-8 GeV ( SPring-8; Hyogo , Japan ) using a stable beam energy of 8 keV in absorption-contrast mode . The tomography system consists of a full-field X-ray microscope with Fresnel zone plate optics ( Uesugi et al . , 2017 ) . The FOV and effective pixel size are 0 . 11 mm² and 0 . 0826 μm² , respectively . We used semiautomatic segmentation algorithms based on gray-value differences in the software ITK-SNAP ( Yushkevich et al . , 2006 ) to obtain 3D representations of the genitalia of Neotrogla . Rendering of the mesh objects was carried out using the software BLENDER ( blender . org ) . Objects were imported as stl files , surface meshes were slightly smoothed , and the number of vertices were reduced without altering the 3D geometry . No further processing was applied . All measurements were carried out in BLENDER . A virgin female of N . brasiliensis ( Figures 1C and 2D: voucher ID: CLKY1 ) was also used for confocal laser scanning microscope ( CLSM ) observation ( Leica TCS SP5 , Wetzlar , Germany ) . The spermathecal plate was removed and mounted on a glass slide with glycerol . We used an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 – 680 nm , detected using two channels and visualized separately with two pseudocolors ( 510 – 580 nm = green; 580 – 680 nm = red ) . To visualize resilin , we used an excitation wavelength of 405 nm and an emission wavelength of 420 – 480 nm , detected on one channel and represented with a blue pseudocolor . A virgin female of N . aurora ( Gruta Couve-Flor cave; Aurora do Tocantins , Tocantins , Brazil , 7 . i . 2009 ) was used to take the whole-abdomen photo shown in Figure 1A . The abdomen was removed from a fixed specimen and soaked in Proteinase K at 45°C overnight and stored in glycerol . Photographs were taken with an Olympus E-M5 digital camera attached to an Olympus SZX16 binocular microscope ( Tokyo , Japan ) . Partially focused pictures were combined using Helicon Focus ( Helicon Soft Ltd . , http://www . heliconsoft . com ) to obtain images with a high depth of field . The holotype female of N . truncata ( Lienhard et al . , 1893 ) was used for photographing the spermathecal plate shown in Figure 1B . Photographs were taken with an Olympus E-M5 attached to a Zeiss Axiophot compound light microscope ( Oberkochen , Germany ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']",['evolutionary biology'],elife-39563-v2,246,3408,3162,13.853658536585366

For instance , species in the crucifer family – which includes mustard , cabbages and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana – can defend themselves with camalexin , a compound produced soon after the plant receives signals from its attacker . What controls this precise timing , however , is still unclear . For the genes that rule the production of camalexin to be ‘read’ , interpreted , and ultimately converted into proteins , their DNA sequences first need to be physically accessible to the cell . This availability is controlled , in part , by adding or removing chemical groups onto histones , the spool-like structures which DNA wraps around . These precisely controlled modifications ultimately help to activate or repress a gene . Sometimes , activating and inhibiting chemical groups can be present in the same location , creating what is known as a bivalent chromatin domain . Zhao et al . investigated whether histone modifications regulate when A . thaliana produces camalexin in response to an attack . A combination of bioinformatics and experimental approaches highlighted two chemical modifications ( one repressive , the other activating ) which were present on the same histone , forming a previously unknown bivalent chromatin domain . Mutant plants which did not carry these modifications could not produce camalexin at the right time . Further experiments showed that under normal conditions , both histone modifications were present . However , when the plant was under attack , the level of repressive and activating modifications respectively decreased and increased , leading to gene activation . Together , the results by Zhao et al . suggest that both histone modifications are required for camalexin genes to respond appropriately to signals from a harmful agent . A deeper understanding of this new mechanism could , in turn , allow scientists to engineer crops that are better at resisting disease .","Temporal dynamics of gene expression underpin responses to internal and environmental stimuli . In eukaryotes , regulation of gene induction includes changing chromatin states at target genes and recruiting the transcriptional machinery that includes transcription factors . As one of the most potent defense compounds in Arabidopsis thaliana , camalexin can be rapidly induced by bacterial and fungal infections . Though several transcription factors controlling camalexin biosynthesis genes have been characterized , how the rapid activation of genes in this pathway upon a pathogen signal is enabled remains unknown . By combining publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin modification mapping , we found that camalexin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications with opposite effects on gene expression , trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 ( H3K27me3 ) ( repression ) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 ( H3K18ac ) ( activation ) , to form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin . Mutants with reduced H3K27me3 or H3K18ac suggested that both modifications were required to determine the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of the stress response . Our study indicates that the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin , which we name as kairostat , plays an important role in controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stress stimuli in plants . 
 Plants produce many metabolites that are essential for responding to environmental cues , the expression of which requires tight temporal control ( Barco and Clay , 2019; Grotewold , 2005; Martin et al . , 2010 ) . One of the most prominent defense metabolites from Arabidopsis thaliana is camalexin . Camalexin is an indole alkaloid derived from tryptophan and can be induced rapidly by various biotic and abiotic stimuli in Arabidopsis ( Stotz et al . , 2011 ) . Essential biosynthetic enzymes belong to the cytochrome P450 family , including CYP79B2/3 , CYP71A12/13 , and PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT 3 ( PAD3 ) ( Klein et al . , 2013; Schuhegger et al . , 2006 ) . The expression of these enzymatic genes can be rapidly induced by various abiotic and biotic stresses , and pathogen-derived substances such as flagellin 22 ( FLG22 ) and oligogalacturonides ( Denoux et al . , 2008 ) . Previous studies revealed complex transcriptional and translational control of camalexin biosynthesis genes ( Frerigmann et al . , 2016; Stahl et al . , 2016; Zhou et al . , 2020; Birkenbihl et al . , 2012; Frerigmann et al . , 2015; Mao et al . , 2011 ) . At the transcriptional regulation level , transcription factors from the MYB family , including MYB34 , MYB51 , and MYB122 , promote camalexin biosynthesis in response to Pseudomonas syringae infection ( Stahl et al . , 2016; Frerigmann et al . , 2015 ) . WRKY33 functions as an activator and directly binds to the promoters of camalexin biosynthesis genes ( Birkenbihl et al . , 2012 ) . Besides transcription factors , CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE ( CPK ) 5/6 and MAPK3/6 can phosphorylate WRKY33 to enhance promoter binding and transactivation ( Zhou et al . , 2020; Mao et al . , 2011 ) . At the translational level , ribosome footprinting showed that genes involved in camalexin biosynthesis , CYP79B2 and CYP79B3 , also increased translational efficiency under pattern triggered immunity ( Xu et al . , 2017; Yoo et al . , 2020 ) . Despite the rich knowledge of these upstream regulators of the camalexin biosynthetic pathway , it remains unknown how the rapid induction upon a pathogen signal is enabled . The accessibility of target gene regions to transcription factors is determined by the dynamics of chromatin states in eukaryotic cells ( Stricker et al . , 2017 ) . Chromatin states are controlled by epigenetic modifications that influence nucleosome accessibility ( Vihervaara et al . , 2018 ) . Epigenetic modifications constitute various covalent decoration of chemical groups to histones and DNA , which are associated with promoting or repressing gene expression by altering chromatin accessibility to transcription factors ( Stricker et al . , 2017; Henikoff and Greally , 2016; Venkatesh and Workman , 2015 ) . For example , trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 ( H3K27me3 ) , established by the polycomb repressive complex 2 , is associated with repressing gene expression ( Carter et al . , 2018 ) . H3K27me3 represses gene expression by increasing chromatin condensation and limiting the recruitment of transcription factors and other components of the transcriptional machinery ( Aranda et al . , 2015 ) . Trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone 3 ( H3K4me3 ) is marked at actively transcribed genes ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) , which activates gene expression by promoting the recruitment of transcription initiation factors to promoters of target genes ( Lauberth et al . , 2013 ) . Epigenetic marks that play opposite roles on gene expression can co-localize at the same gene regions to form bivalent chromatins ( Bernstein et al . , 2006; Voigt et al . , 2013 ) . Bivalent chromatins were initially observed to be associated with genes involved in cell differentiation in human embryonic stem cells and the most reported variant is formed by H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 ( Bernstein et al . , 2006; Dattani et al . , 2018; Sachs et al . , 2013 ) . Bivalent chromatins also exist in other mammalian cell types and can be formed by other epigenetic marks , including additional activating ( H3K4me1 , H3K4me2 , H3K36me3 , H3K9ac , H3K27ac , H3K14ac , H4K18ac ) and repressive ( H3K9me2 , H3K9me3 , H4K20me3 , 5Mc ) marks ( van der Velde et al . , 2021; Xu and Kidder , 2018; Charlet et al . , 2016; Matsumura et al . , 2015; Roy and Sridharan , 2017 ) . In plants , the H3K27m3-H3K4me3 bivalent chromatin has been observed at FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ) ( Jiang et al . , 2008 ) in A . thaliana and genes associated with cold stress in potato tuber ( Zeng et al . , 2019 ) . Recently , a novel bivalent chromatin formed by H3K27me3 and H3K4me1 was identified in Brassica napus ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Therefore , bivalent chromatins can be formed by different pairs of epigenetic marks . Despite many reports on the existence of bivalent chromatins , much less is known about their biological roles . The only function that has been proposed for a bivalent chromatin is to poise the expression of developmental genes in stem cells for rapid activation into differentiation ( Bernstein et al . , 2006 ) . This hypothesis has been tested and supported by studies only on mammalian embryonic stem cells or cancer cells ( Deng et al . , 2013; Lima-Fernandes et al . , 2019; Jia et al . , 2012 ) . The ‘poise genes for transcriptional activation’ role of bivalent chromatin has not yet been tested on a whole organism . And , to our knowledge , no other role has been implicated for bivalent chromatins . Here , by integrating epigenomic profiles with a genome-wide metabolic network in Arabidopsis , we found that two epigenetic marks playing opposite roles on gene expression , H3K27me3 and H3K18ac , were enriched at camalexin biosynthesis and several other specialized metabolic pathways . Focusing on the camalexin biosynthesis pathway in this study , sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation ( SeqChIP ) -PCR confirmed that these two marks were co-localized in vivo and formed a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin . Mutants defective in H3K27m3 and H3K18ac suggested that both modifications were required to determine the timely induction of camalexin biosynthetic gene expression and camalexin accumulation under FLG22 treatment . This study revealed a new type of bivalent chromatin whose function may be to determine the timely induction of defense-compound biosynthesis in response to a pathogen signal . 
 Camalexin biosynthesis pathway is one of the best characterized pathways associated with specialized metabolism in Arabidopsis ( Stotz et al . , 2011; Frerigmann et al . , 2016 ) . We identified epigenetic marks enriched in the camalexin biosynthesis pathway using an omics data-driven approach by integrating 16 publicly available epigenomic profiles with Arabidopsis genome-scale metabolic network annotation . High-resolution epigenomic profiles including histone variants , DNA methylation and histone modifications were obtained from seedlings grown under similar conditions ( Wang et al . , 2015; Luo et al . , 2013; Roudier et al . , 2011 ) . To map these epigenetic marks on metabolic domains , pathways , and genes , we used genome-wide functional annotations of metabolism ( Schläpfer et al . , 2017 ) . Enrichment analysis at the metabolic domain level revealed distinct patterns , including specialized metabolism being enriched with both a repression mark H3K27me3 and an activation mark H3K18ac ( Figure 1A ) . Correlation of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac marks on the Arabidopsis genome had been reported previously ( Luo et al . , 2013 ) , which we also observed using total metabolic genes ( Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0 . 36 , t-test p-value 4 . 6E-11 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A ) . To determine if specialized metabolic genes drove the correlation of these two marks on metabolic genes , we removed specialized metabolic genes from the total metabolic genes and reanalyzed the correlation patterns . We observed decreased correlation between H3K27me3 and H3K18ac , indicating that specialized metabolic genes substantially contributed to the correlation of these two marks on metabolic genes ( Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0 . 11 , t-test p-value 3 . 5E-02 ) ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1B ) . To determine how prevalent the H3K27me3-H3K18ac association was for specialized metabolic genes , we counted the number of genes marked by both modifications . We found that 37% ( 324 out of 887 ) of specialized metabolic genes were marked by both H3K27me3 and H3K81ac ( Figure 1B ) . We then asked in which specialized metabolic pathways these two marks were significantly enriched by selecting the pathways that were annotated to specialized metabolism based on the Plant Metabolic Network database . To increase the statistical power , we only included the specialized metabolic pathways containing at least 10 genes , which resulted in 42 pathways . Among them , we found several pathways , including camalexin and glucosinolate biosynthesis pathways , to be significantly enriched with both epigenetic marks ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2 , Supplementary file 1 ) . To decipher the nature and function of the H3K27me3-H3K18ac dual association on controlling gene expression , we focused our investigation on the camalexin biosynthetic genes . We developed two mutually non-exclusive hypotheses about the role of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on the expression of camalexin biosynthesis genes: ( 1 ) H3K27me3 and H3K18ac are co-localized on the same genes in the same cell and control their gene expression induction; or ( 2 ) H3K27me3 and H3K18ac are associated with the same genes but in different cells , which may contribute to determining cell-type specificity of this pathway . To distinguish between the two possibilities , we examined in vivo co-localization of the two modifications using SeqChIP-qPCR , which requires a two-step , serial chromatin pull-down with antibodies against these two modifications . Though more than 10 genes were annotated to camalexin biosynthesis pathway in the Plant Metabolic Network database , we focused on the three experimentally validated genes that are essential in synthesizing camalexin , CYP79B2 , CYP71A13 , and Phytoalexin Deficient 3 ( PAD3 ) ( Klein et al . , 2013; Schuhegger et al . , 2006Figure 2A ) . To assess the antibodies’ specificity and efficiency , we included several negative and positive controls , including a transcription factor-encoding gene called Golden-2-Like 1 ( GLK ) that was previously observed to be associated with both H3K27me3 and H3K18ac ( Luo et al . , 2013 ) . All three camalexin biosynthesis genes showed significantly higher signals when pulled down with both antibodies against H3K27me3 and H3K18ac than without any antibody in the second pull-down ( Figure 2B ) . We observed comparable pull-down efficiency for GLK between this study and the previous publication ( Zeng et al . , 2019 ) . Altering the order of the two antibodies for H3K27me3 and H3K18ac in the pull-down showed similar patterns ( Figure 2C ) . These results indicated that H3K27me3 and H3K18ac are co-localized at the camalexin biosynthesis genes in planta to form a bivalent chromatin . The biological function of bivalent chromatins has long been hypothesized to poise gene expression for rapid activation upon signal perception . To date , this model has been tested only in mammalian stem cells and cancer cells ( Zeng et al . , 2019; Zhang et al . , 2021; Deng et al . , 2013 ) , and no direct evidence is available in a whole organism context . As a first step to understand the role of the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin on camalexin genes , we examined the transcriptional kinetics of camalexin biosynthesis genes under FLG22 induction in wild type and mutant lines with defective deposition of H3K27me3 or H3K18ac . We selected chromatin remodeler pickle ( pkl-1 ) ( Carter et al . , 2018 ) and histone methyltransferase curly leaf 28 ( clf28 ) ( Doyle and Amasino , 2009 ) to study the function of H3K27me3 on gene expression . The protein complex involved in establishing H3K18ac has not been well characterized in Arabidopsis , which limits the genetic resources that can be utilized to study the function of this epigenetic modification . The available mutant lines associated with establishing H3K18ac are increased DNA methylation 1 and 2 ( idm1 and idm2 ) ( Qian et al . , 2014; Qian et al . , 2012 ) . IDM1 is a histone acetyltransferase and IDM2 is a heat shock protein that functions in the same protein complex as IDM1 ( Qian et al . , 2014; Qian et al . , 2012 ) . In wild-type plants , CYP71A13 and PAD3 were significantly induced within 30 min after FLG22 treatment and CYP79B2 was significantly induced within 1 hr after the treatment ( Figure 3A-C , Supplementary file 3 to 5 ) . In mutants with reduced deposition of H3K27me3 or H3K18ac , the induction patterns of the camalexin biosynthetic genes were disrupted . For pkl-1 and clf28 ( reduced H3K27me3 marks ) , all three camalexin biosynthesis genes showed a significant induction of expression much faster than the wild type , within 5 min of FLG22 treatment , and the degree of induction was much higher than that in wild-type plants at 6 hr of the treatment ( Figure 3A to C , Supplementary file 3 to 5 ) . In contrast , in the lines with reduced H3K18ac marks , idm1 and idm2 , genes were induced much later than the wild type . CYP71A13 and PAD3 were significantly induced within 1 hr after the treatment and CYP79B2 was induced within 3 hr after the treatment ( Figure 3A to C , Supplementary file 3 to 5 ) . To better understand the effect of genotype , FLG22 treatment , and duration of treatment on gene expression , we conducted a three-way ANOVA using raw transcripts of camalexin genes . Genotype , treatment , duration of treatment , and their interactions significantly contribute to the expression changes of CYP71A13 and PAD3 ( Supplementary file 5 ) . For CYP79B2 , all experimental variables contributed significantly to its expression patterns except the genotype × treatment × duration of treatment ( Supplementary file 5 ) . These data generally support the idea that disrupting H3K27me3 and H3K18ac affects the temporal induction patterns of camalexin genes in response to FLG22 treatment . To test whether the changes in gene expression would lead to changes in metabolite accumulation , we measured camalexin content using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) . For wild-type plants , camalexin accumulation significantly increased 3 hr after FLG22 treatment and continued to increase 6 hr after the treatment ( Figure 3D , Supplementary file 6 ) . Plants with reduced H3K27me3 marks , clf28 and pkl-1 , started to accumulate more camalexin earlier , 1 and 3 hr after FLG22 treatment , and continued to increase at later time points . On the other hand , for mutants with reduced H3K18ac marks , idm1 and idm2 , camalexin accumulated much later , at 6 hr after the treatment ( Figure 3D , Supplementary file 6 ) . We examined the effect of genotype , FLG22 treatment , and duration of the treatment on camalexin accumulation using three-way ANOVA ( Supplementary file 6 ) . Each of the three factors affected camalexin content significantly ( p-values = 1 . 57E-05 , 7 . 71E-09 , 2 . 00E-16 ) . However , the interaction between genotype and treatment and the three-way interaction , genotype × FLG22 × duration of treatment , were not significant ( p-values = 6 . 20E-02 and 9 . 50E-01 ) . One possibility is that the kinetics of metabolite changes might be different from transcripts since significant accumulation of camalexin was detected at later time points . Another possibility is metabolite data being noisier than gene expression data . In summary , the transcriptional kinetics analysis suggests that H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin might control the timing of camalexin production in response to FLG22 , which is partially corroborated with metabolite accumulation patterns . We next asked whether FLG22 treatment changed the relative amount of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac marks on the camalexin biosynthetic genes . To address this question , we quantified the abundance of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on the camalexin biosynthetic genes with or without FLG22 treatment using ChIP-qPCR . For each gene tested , primers were designed to cover a genomic region that included 1 kb upstream and the entire transcribed region ( Supplementary file 2 ) . In plants treated with FLG22 , the abundance of H3K18ac was significantly higher in the gene regions of CYP71A13 , CYP79B2 , and PAD3 compared to the mock-treated plants ( Figure 3E ) . Moreover , the abundance of H3K27me3 modification was significantly lower in the regions of these genes in response to FLG22 ( Figure 3F ) . These results suggest that the FLG22-induced changes of camalexin biosynthetic gene expression involve remodeling of the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin . Taken together , this study demonstrates that a novel bivalent chromatin formed by H3K27me3 and H3K18ac controls the timing of induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes upon stress , with H3K18ac expediting and H3K27me3 attenuating expression to hit the presumed ‘sweet spot’ ( Figure 3G ) . We have named this type of bivalent chromatin regulator a kairostat , inspired by the ancient Greek word ‘kairos’ meaning the right moment and ‘stat’ meaning regulating device . 
 Plant specialized metabolites are integral for plant-environmental interactions and defense against herbivores and pathogens . Camalexin is a prominent phytoalexin in Arabidopsis and genes associated with its biosynthesis are induced rapidly upon pathogen signals such as FLG22 ( Denoux et al . , 2008; Stahl et al . , 2016; Zipfel et al . , 2004 ) . In this study , we found that H3K27me3 and H3K18ac co-localized on camalexin biosynthesis genes forming a previously uncharacterized form of bivalent chromatin . We examined the role of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin on the induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes by combining publicly available epigenomics data with genetics , molecular biology , and biochemistry . In wild-type ( Col-0 ) plants , camalexin biosynthesis genes were activated at 30 min to 1 hr of FLG22 treatment and continued to increase their expression at later time points of the treatment . This is consistent with the previous study on induction kinetics of defense pathways , including camalexin , under FLG22 treatment ( Denoux et al . , 2008 ) . In mutants with defective deposition of H3K27me3 or H3K18ac , the induction kinetics of camalexin biosynthesis genes and metabolite accumulation was accelerated or delayed , respectively . Our results provide new evidence for how chemical defense mediated by camalexin may be regulated at the epigenetic level . However , we cannot rule out the possibility that other known mechanisms regulating camalexin genes may also affect transcriptional kinetics and metabolite accumulation . For example , H3K27me3 affects gene expression by altering chromatin accessibility to transcription factors ( Aranda et al . , 2015 ) . Removing this repression mark may create a permissive environment and facilitate transcription factors , such as WRKY33 , to bind to promoters of camalexin genes . At the translational level , camalexin biosynthesis genes can alter translational efficiency controlled by a highly enriched messenger RNA consensus sequence , R-motif , during pattern triggered immunity ( Xu et al . , 2017; Yoo et al . , 2020 ) . Additional studies are needed to unravel how different regulatory machineries work together to enable the rapid induction of camalexin genes upon stress signals . In this study , we attempted to reveal the biological function of bivalent chromatin , which has long been hypothesized to poise developmental genes in embryonic stem cells for rapid activation upon a cell differentiation signal ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . Only few studies directly tested this hypothesis and all of them focused on mammalian stem cells or cancer cells ( Deng et al . , 2013; Lima-Fernandes et al . , 2019; Jia et al . , 2012 ) . For example , in embryonic stem cells , H3K27me3-H3K4me3 bivalent chromatin was associated with HoxB4 , one of the key regulators controlling development . Inhibition of H3K4 methyltransferase , hSET1A , repressed the expression of HoxB4 and blocked the differentiation of blood cells ( Deng et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , H3K27me3-H3K4me3 bivalent chromatin was observed in cancer-initiating cells . Disruption of the bivalent state through inhibition of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 inhibited the self-renewal of cancer cells through de-repression of a key canonical marker of normal colonocyte differentiation , named Indian Hedgehog ( Lima-Fernandes et al . , 2019 ) . Despite this knowledge , the role of bivalent chromatin on regulating metabolism remains unknown . In this study , we reported the co-localization of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on camalexin biosynthesis genes and functionally examined the role of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin in Arabidopsis . The results suggest that H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin maintains the proper timing of camalexin gene induction upon a pathogen signal . To fully elucidate how bivalent chromatin integrates environmental cues to regulate gene expression , it would be critical to understand how bivalent chromatin is established and maintained and how different epigenetic marks function cooperatively to control gene expression . To achieve these goals , it is required to characterize all the proteins involved in establishing different epigenetic marks . Mechanisms that enable histone modification protein complexes to alter the abundance of each mark upon stress signals also remains to be elucidated . A recent study showed that NF-Y transcription factors can interact with histone modification protein REF6 to reduce H3K27me3 at the SOC1 locus ( Hou et al . , 2014 ) . It would be interesting to examine whether transcription factors that directly bind to promoters of camalexin biosynthesis genes interact with proteins that can deposit or remove both epigenetic marks forming bivalent chromatin upon stress signals . The H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin and its role on the camalexin biosynthesis genes described here provide the molecular handle with which to open these lines of investigations in the future . With these knowledge gaps filled , kairostats can be engineered to function as a regulatory cassette to control the expression of target genes under specific tissues and conditions . This capability will provide novel routes to re-program biological processes involved in development and stress response , which have far-reaching implications in agriculture , engineering , and medicine . 
 Arabidopsis metabolic enzymes and pathways were extracted from Plant Metabolic Network ( http://www . plantcyc . org/ ) . Enzymes were annotated based on the Ensemble Enzyme Prediction Pipeline ( E2P2 ) v . 3 . 0 ( Schläpfer et al . , 2017; Chae et al . , 2014 ) , metabolic pathways were predicted by Pathway Tools software v . 18 . 5 ( Karp et al . , 2011 ) , which were further validated by a process called Semi-Automated Validation and Integration ( SAVI ) v . 3 . 02 ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) . In A . thaliana , 5451 genes were predicted to encode enzymes that catalyze 3585 reactions in small molecule metabolism , which were assigned to 627 pathways based on prediction and manual curation in the release of PMN 13 . 0 ( Schläpfer et al . , 2017 ) . These pathways were further grouped into 13 metabolic domains based on the types of metabolites that they potentially synthesize ( Schläpfer et al . , 2017 ) . The metabolic domain ( s ) assigned to a given pathway were transferred to the reactions , EC numbers , and proteins/genes associated with that pathway . To improve the statistical power , we included only those pathways that contained more than 10 genes when we performed epigenetic modification enrichment analysis on individual pathways in specialized metabolism ( Sham and Purcell , 2014 ) . The 16 epigenomic profiles were downloaded from Wang et al . , 2015 , where previously published ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip data for all epigenetic marks were re-mapped to A . thaliana genome TAIR v . 10 ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) . Briefly , for each ChIP-seq profile , the signals were binned and ranked in the genome ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) . We used the ranked epigenetic modification signals in the following analyses . To identify the predominant epigenetic modifications associated with metabolic domains and pathways , we first mapped the ranked epigenetic modification signals to each gene , including the transcribed region , 1 kb upstream , and 500 bp downstream regions . Then , we calculated the average epigenetic modification density for each domain or pathway by taking the sum of the ranked modification signals observed within all the genes in that domain or pathway and normalizing it to the total length of all genes . To identify enriched marks within metabolic domains or pathways , we compared the density of each epigenetic modification within that domain or pathway to the background signal . We defined the background signal as the average density of each epigenetic modification by taking the sum of the epigenetic modification signals observed within total metabolic gene regions and normalizing it to the length of these genes . The statistical significance of enrichment or depletion of epigenetic marks per domain or pathway was determined by fold change of at least 1 . 5 and Fisher’s exact test p-value , followed by a post hoc adjustment using false discovery rate ( FDR ) with the threshold of 0 . 01 . The heatmaps were generated with gplots v . 3 ( Warnes , 2009 ) and ggplot2 v . 3 . 1 ( Wickham , 2016 ) packages in RStudio . Seeds of A . thaliana accession Columbia ( Col-0 ) ( wild type ) and previously characterized mutant lines clf28 ( SALK_139371 ) , pkl-1 ( SALK_010693 ) , idm1 ( SALK_062999 ) , and idm2 ( SALK_138229 ) were used in this study . Seeds of these mutants were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center . In all the experiments described in this study , seeds were stratified at 4°C for 3 days before germination and grown in 0 . 5× Murashige and Skoog ( MS ) medium containing 1% sucrose and 0 . 8% agar at 23°C under long days ( 16 hr light/8 hr dark ) with controlled light at 100 µmol photosynthetic photons/m2 s ( PPFD ) . Two-week-old seedlings were harvested for the ChIP-qPCR , SeqChIP-PCR , transcriptional kinetics , and camalexin content measurement experiments . Two-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings ( Col-0 ) were used in ChIP and SeqChIP ( sequential ChIP ) experiments . To obtain sufficient chromatin for immunoprecipitation , 200 seedlings ( about 2 g ) were pooled for each ChIP reaction . Plant tissues were fixed with crosslinking buffer containing 1% formaldehyde for 20 min by vacuum infiltration at room temperature and quenched with glycine ( final concentration 100 mM ) for 5 min . After grinding , the cross-linked chromatin was isolated using ice-cold nuclear lysis buffer ( 50 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1% Triton X-100 , 0 . 1% Na deoxycholate , 0 . 1% SDS , and protease inhibitor ) and disrupted by sonication to yield DNA fragments of 200–600 bp ( Zhu et al . , 2016; Saleh et al . , 2008 ) . To examine the abundance of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac 30 min after 1 µM FLG22 treatment , ChIP-qPCR was used to quantify their abundance throughout the genomic region and 1 kb upstream of the three essential camalexin biosynthesis genes . After chromatin crosslinking and shearing , DNA/protein complexes were equally divided and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against H3K27me3 ( Millipore , Cat No 07–449 ) , H3K18ac ( Abcam , Cat No ab1191 ) , or IgG as antibody control ( Millipore , Cat No 12–370 ) by referring the ChIP protocol established using Arabidopsis tissues ( Zhu et al . , 2016; Saleh et al . , 2008 ) . DNA was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit ( Qiagen , Cat No 28104 ) . Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using LightCycler 480 System ( Roche ) with the SensiFAST Sybr No-Rox mix ( Bioline , Cat No BIO98020 ) from Bioline . Three biological replicates were used in each experiment . The ChIP experiments were performed twice with different Arabidopsis tissues and revealed similar results . Primers were designed to cover the 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site and the entire transcribed region ( Supplementary file 2 ) . SeqChIP experiments were performed to examine in planta co-localization of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on camalexin biosynthesis genes . Chromatin crosslinking and shearing followed the protocol described above for ChIP-qPCR . For each ChIP/re-ChIP assay , 20 µg DNA/protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-H3K27me3 ( Millipore , Cat No 07–449 ) and anti-H3K18ac ( Abcam , Cat No ab1191 ) antibodies using the Re-ChIP-IT kit ( Active Motif , Cat No 53016 ) . Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using LightCycler 480 System ( Roche ) with the SensiFAST Sybr No-Rox mix ( Bioline , Cat No BIO98020 ) from Bioline . To represent final results after two-step chromatin immunoprecipitation , the pull-down efficiency was calculated as the percent of first ChIP using the equation: 1st ChIP = 2^ ( Cq_2nd ChIP – Cq_1st ChIP ) . Three biological replicates were used in each experiment . The SeqChIP was performed twice using different Arabidopsis tissues and altering the order of antibodies in two rounds of pull-down showed similar results . Primer sequences used in this assay are provided in Supplementary file 3 . Two-week-old seedlings grown in MS agar media as described in the Plant materials and growth conditions section were used to study transcriptional kinetics . FLG22 , a short peptide of 22 amino acids ( sequence: QRLSTGSRINSAKDDAAGLQIA ) , was synthesized at Stanford Protein and Nucleic Acid ( PAN ) Facility . To induce the expression of camalexin biosynthesis genes , seedlings were sprayed with 1 µM FLG22 dissolved in deionized ( DI ) water . Control samples were sprayed with the same volume of DI water . FLG22 and water-treated tissues were sampled at 5 min , 30 min , 1 hr , 3 hr , and 6 hr after treatment and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen . After grinding in liquid nitrogen , RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Cat No 74904 ) and 2 µg RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System ( Thermo Fisher , Cat No 18080051 ) . Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using LightCycler 480 System ( Roche ) with the SensiFAST Sybr No-Rox mix ( Bioline , Cat No BIO98020 ) from Bioline . Primers used in this experiment are summarized in Supplementary file 4 . A housekeeping gene , Actin 2 ( AT3G18780 ) , was used as the reference gene in the qPCR experiments . Three biological replicates were used in each experiment by polling 10 seedlings per replicate . The transcriptional kinetics assays were performed twice and showed similar results . Two-week-old seedlings of Col-0 , pkl-1 , clf28 , idm1 , and idm2 plants were used to measure camalexin accumulation . Tissues were treated with FLG22 or DI water as described in the ""Transcriptional kinetics analysis"" section . Metabolites were extracted using a 75% methanol solution with 0 . 1% formic acid . For each sample , 150 mg of ground plant tissue was dissolved in 200 µL extraction solution . The extracted samples were vortexed at room temperature for 40 min and centrifuged at 32 , 000 g for 10 min to pellet plant debris . The supernatant was analyzed by an Agilent 1260 Infinity Binary HPLC paired with an Agilent 6420 Triple Quadrupole LC-MS/MS , with a reversed-phase column ( Agilent EclipsePlus C18 , 2 . 1 × 50 mm , 1 . 8 μm ) , water with 0 . 1% formic acid as solvent A and acetonitrile with 0 . 1% formic acid as solvent B , at a constant flow rate of 0 . 4 mL/min and an injection volume of 10 µL . The following gradient was used for metabolite separation: 0–0 . 5 min , 10–50% B; 0 . 5–5 . 5 min , 50–98% B; 5 . 5–6 min , 98% B; 6 . 00–6 . 01 min , 98–10% B; 2 min post-time equilibration with 10% B . The LC eluent was subjected to MS for 0 . 01–6 . 01 min with the ESI source in positive mode , gas temperature at 350°C , gas flow rate at 11 L/min , and nebulizer pressure at 40 psi . To detect camalexin , we set the multiple reaction monitoring ( MRM ) ion transition to be 201 . 26 → 59 . 2 , fragmentor at 135 V , and collision energy at 40 V . The MRM ion transitions in this work were derived from product ion scan with precursor ion set at 201 . 26 and the most abundant product ion was chosen for MRM transition quantification . LC-MS/MS data files were analyzed using Agilent MassHunter Workstation software v . B . 06 . 00 . Metabolite content was quantified by integrating peak area under the ion count curve . The ion counts were calibrated to camalexin chemical standard ( Cat Num Sigma SML1016 ) and converted to measurements of titer in molar concentrations ( nM ) . Three biological replicates were used in each experiment by polling 50 seedlings per replicate . The experiments were conducted twice with different plant samples and showed similar results .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['plant biology', 'short report']",elife-69508-v2,114,5957,5843,52.25438596491228

Any changes to the DNA in the genome can alter the instructions that are given to cells , which can lead to cancer and other diseases . However , changes to the genome can sometimes be beneficial as they can introduce more variety into the instructions carried by different individuals , which increases their potential to adapt to changes in their environment . In plants and animals , DNA is arranged into structures called chromosomes . Generally , an individual's genome contains two copies of each chromosome; one inherited from their mother and one from their father . However , occasionally during reproduction , all the chromosomes from one of the parents are left out from the cells of the offspring in a process called ‘genome elimination’ . This makes individuals that carry only half the normal number of chromosomes , known as haploids . Sometimes the process of genome elimination is disrupted , which leads to individuals that have incomplete genomes or chromosomes that carry big rearrangements of the DNA , as if they had been shattered and put back together incorrectly . In a small plant known as Arabidopsis thaliana , genome elimination frequently happens in the offspring of two individuals that carry different versions of a gene called centromeric histone H3 ( CENH3 ) . However , it is not clear how this works , or what roles genome elimination plays in evolution and disease . Here , Tan et al . studied genome elimination by cross-breeding Arabidopsis plants that carried a mutant form of CENH3 with plants that have a normal version of the protein . The experiments found that many of the offspring were haploid . Some of the others carried an extra copy of an entire chromosome or a section of a chromosome . A third group had an extra copy of a chromosome that was missing some sections or had been rearranged . These ‘shattered’ chromosomes were always formed from chromosomes that came from the parent plant with a mutant form of CENH3 . Tan et al . also found that a protein called DNA Ligase 4 , which helps reconnect broken DNA strands , is involved in repairing the breaks in these shattered chromosomes . Some of the genetic rearrangements documented in the experiments were passed on to subsequent generations of plants , which suggests that these genomic changes can be stable enough to be inherited . The genomic rearrangements observed in the Arabidopsis plants are similar to those seen in patients with cancer and other genetic diseases . Tan et al . findings show that Arabidopsis plants provide a useful system for studying these genome rearrangements , which may inform efforts to treat these human diseases .","Genome instability is associated with mitotic errors and cancer . This phenomenon can lead to deleterious rearrangements , but also genetic novelty , and many questions regarding its genesis , fate and evolutionary role remain unanswered . Here , we describe extreme chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination , a process resulting from hybridization of Arabidopsis plants expressing different centromere histones H3 . Shattered chromosomes are formed from the genome of the haploid inducer , consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single , laggard chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucleus . Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by repair through non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) or stalled fork repair . Furthermore , mutation of required NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery . Lastly , heritability and stability of a rearranged chromosome suggest a potential for enduring genomic novelty . These findings provide a tractable , natural system towards investigating the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders . 
 Nucleosomes containing variant histone ( centromeric histone H3 , CENH3 ) ( Verdaasdonk and Bloom , 2011 ) ( also known as CENP-A ) determine centromeres . In the absence of the endogenous CENH3 , Arabidopsis thaliana mitotic and meiotic functions can be complemented by chimeric CENH3 ( Ravi and Chan , 2010; Ravi et al . , 2010 ) or CENH3 from diverged plant species ( Maheshwari et al . , 2015 ) , but crossing these strains to wild-type individuals results in frequent loss of the chromosomes marked by the variant CENH3 . Following stochastic genome elimination in the early mitotic divisions , the progeny can be haploid , aneuploid or diploid ( Ravi and Chan , 2010; Ravi et al . , 2014 ) . In nature , similar phenomena involve defective CENH3 loading ( Sanei et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , mating of individuals that express diverged CENH3s , can lead to mitotic catastrophe . The consequences of mitotic malfunction on genome integrity can be dire ( McClintock , 1984; Gordon et al . , 2012 ) . Missegregated chromosomes can lead to aneuploidy ( Janssen et al . , 2011 ) , but also to extensive and catastrophic restructuring resulting in , sequentially , chromosome sequestration in micronuclei , endonucleolytic damage , defective repair , and finally rescue ( Crasta et al . , 2012; Hatch et al . , 2013; Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . The resulting structurally rearranged chromosomes may contribute to cancer or developmental syndromes ( Hastings et al . , 2009; Liu et al . , 2011; Stephens et al . , 2011; Jones and Jallepalli , 2012 ) . Nevertheless , chromosomal rearrangements are not necessarily deleterious: some may influence fitness by altering recombination or gene dosage ( Comai et al . , 2003 ) . It is possible that pathways leading to disease and to diversity share a common mechanistic basis ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) . Genome elimination in Arabidopsis provides a previously lacking organismal system to investigate genome instability during mitotic catastrophes , connected mechanisms , and consequences . 
 We used the GFP-tailswap haploid inducer ( Ravi and Chan , 2010; Ravi et al . , 2014 ) in the experimental setup illustrated in Figure 1 . This strain is in the Col-0 background and carries a homozygous CENH3 null mutation whose function is partially complemented by a chimeric CENH3 in which an N-terminal GFP fused to the H3 . 3-like N-terminal tail replaces the native CENH3 N-terminal tail . We crossed this strain to polymorphic accession Ler gl1-1 to track haplotypes in the F1 progeny and obtained the expected haploid induction frequency ( Ravi and Chan , 2010; Ravi et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 1 ) . The recessive gl1-1 mutation confers trichomeless leaves in paternal Ler gl1-1 haploids while it is masked in Col/Ler diploid hybrids . We sequenced 10 of the phenotypically diploid Col/Ler individuals with wild-type phenotype , performed dosage plot and single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) analysis and found that 100% of these were diploid with 50% Col and Ler genomes respectively ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Plants from the aneuploid class exhibited multiple pleiotropic and morphological defects and had trichomes , except in the rare exception when the GL1 locus was lost . The five recognizable primary trisomic ( 2n + 1 ) phenotypes were represented ( Steinitz-Sears , 1963; Koornneef and Vanderveen , 1983 ) : Chromosome 1 ( Chr1 ) trisomics have dark green , serrated leaves and are dwarfed , Chr2 trisomics exhibit round leaves and are late flowering , Chr3 trisomics have narrow , yellow green leaves , Chr4 trisomics display narrow and smaller flat leaves , and Chr5 trisomics display light green and narrow leaves . However , aneuploid plants with more severe or unusual phenotypes were also observed , suggestive of other chromosomal combinations or more serious chromosomal aberrations . Chromosome dosage analysis based on whole genome sequencing ( Henry et al . , 2010 ) ( Supplementary file 1 ) distinguished three chromosomal alteration types in aneuploids ( Figure 2 ) . Similar outcomes were obtained using independently derived haploid inducers , either expressing GFP-tailswap ( Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) or CENH3 from other plant species ( Maheshwari et al . , 2015 ) . The most common type , numerical aneuploids , display whole chromosome aneuploidy such as in the classical primary trisomics ( Figure 2B shows an example for a numerical Chr3 ) . In our dataset , single primary trisomics ( 2n + 1 ) account for 75% of the numerical class . Other individuals from the numerical class with two or more extra whole chromosomes included 16% double primary trisomics ( 2n + 1 + 1 ) , 2% triple primary trisomics ( 2n + 1 + 1 + 1 ) and 3% quadruple primary trisomics ( 2n + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 ) . Additionally , we obtained disomic Chr4 haploids ( n + 1 , a type of numerical aneuploidy that were not included in this analysis ) as well as Chr2 or Chr3 monosomic diploids ( 2n − 1 ) at 4% frequency ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 ) . These have never been described in Arabidopsis before , possibly because , if they were to arise from meiotic defects , they would result from nullisomic gametes , which are not viable ( Henry et al . , 2009 ) . Aneuploids resulting from mitotic failure do not have those constraints . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06516 . 003Figure 1 . Ploidy types resulting from centromere-mediated uniparental genome elimination .

Representative dosage plots from 96 individuals from a selfed GFP-tailswap haploid inducer . Representative dosage plot of diploid individuals ( 94/96 = 98% ) showing a euploid dosage from all five Arabidopsis chromosomes . We detected two selfed individuals with numerical whole chromosome primary trisomies ( 2n + 1 ) for Chr2 and Chr3 , which are shown here . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06516 . 009 The second alteration type is defined by simple truncations and repair of at most two double stranded DNA breaks per chromosome ( Figure 2C shows an example of truncated Chr3 ) . This truncated class was found to occur in 22% of the aneuploid population . In the third class , a single chromosome exhibited many oscillations in copy number state , as if shattered and subsequently rearranged ( Figure 2D shows an example of shattered Chr3 ) . This shattered class was found to occur in 11% of the aneuploid population . Additionally , some of the aneuploids exhibited a combination of numerical , truncated and shattered chromosome types ( Figure 2E ) . Alteration of copy number for Chr1 , 2 and 3 are represented at similar frequencies based on the average copy number alteration of all five chromosomes , with Chr4 and 5 alterations being , respectively , over- and under-represented ( Figure 2F ) . This may be explained by the uneven distribution between chromosomes of few , selected genes that are highly dosage-sensitive . According to this hypothesis , Chr4 would be selectively depleted for such genes . Chromosomal truncations have been reported from a selfed trisomic ( Huettel et al . , 2008 ) . To assess whether truncated and shattered aneuploid types could be produced from meiotic missegregation , we sequenced 96 individuals produced by a selfed Col-0 triploid . Because of the irregular meiosis , most gametes produced by triploids are aneuploid ( Henry et al . , 2007 ) . Dosage analysis revealed that all were numerical aneuploids ( Supplementary file 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 3 ) . To assess whether truncation and shattering could be the result of meiotic defects in the GFP-tailswap line , we sequenced 96 individuals from selfed GFP-tailswap and observed that 98% ( n = 94 ) of the progeny were diploid while two individuals carried single primary trisomies of Chr2 and Chr3 respectively , representing only the numerical class of aneuploids ( Supplementary file 3 and Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ) . Based on these results , we believe that truncated and shattered aneuploid classes from our crosses reflect genomic instability associated with mitotic errors in the early embryo . Shattered chromosomes can be recovered from all five A . thaliana chromosomes ( Figure 3A ) . In some cases , shattering appears to extend to two chromosomes ( top panel of Figure 3A ) only because the haploid inducer used carries a reciprocal Chr1/Chr4 translocation originating from the integration of GFP-tailswap T-DNAs . SNP analysis demonstrates that all duplicated ( copy number 3 ) and triplicated ( copy number 4 ) regions originated from the haploid inducer ( Figure 3B ) . Single-copy regions displaying loss of heterozygosity carry Ler alleles ( i . e . , wild-type ) , consistent with the loss of the haploid inducer haplotype . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06516 . 010Figure 3 . Shattered chromosomes are confined to a single chromosome originating from the haploid inducer . ( A ) Chromosome dosage plots based on non-overlapping 25 kbp bins across each chromosome for five aneuploid individuals with shattered chromosomes . The GFP-tailswap transgene insertion event that resulted in a reciprocal translocation between Chr1 and Chr4 in one of the haploid inducer parent ( GFP-tailswap #11 ) is indicated with black arrowheads . The translocation is only visible in individuals for which chromosomes 1 and 4 are not balanced with each other . Duplications ( copy number 3 ) , triplications ( copy number 4 ) as well as deletions accompanied with loss of heterozygosity ( copy number 1 ) were observed from dosage plots . ( B ) Box plots of the percentage of haploid inducer genome present at each copy number state , as determined by the SNP analysis . Mean and standard errors are shown . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06516 . 010 Although aneuploids from the shattered class were often sterile , line FRAG00062 was partially fertile and allowed us to investigate the inheritance and stability of the variant DNA . We sequenced 16 F2 progeny from FRAG00062 and obtained two individuals with precisely the same shattered pattern as the F1 parent and 14 that appeared diploid ( Figure 4A ) . Meiotic co-inheritance of all dosage variant segments is consistent with a single , stable chromosomal unit that was formed after a catastrophe . To confirm this hypothesis , we used DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization to visualize the FRAG00062 chromosomes using Col-0 derived BAC painting probes specific for Chr1 and Chr4 ( Figure 4B ) . Mitotic cells contained 11 chromosomes ( Figure 4D ) . FRAG00062 came from a cross using GFP-tailswap line #11 , which carried a reciprocal Chr1/4 translocation ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . This allowed us to distinguish the haploid inducer Chr1 , the Ler Chr1 , and a third Chr1 with rearranged signals , which we interpret as the shattered extranumerary chromosome ( Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . During meiotic Metaphase I ( Figure 4D ) or other meiotic stages observed from male meiocytes ( Figure 4—figure supplement 2 ) , the shattered chromosome does not pair with the parental Chr1s . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06516 . 011Figure 4 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06516 . 013 Next , we sought to investigate why shattering is restricted to a single chromosome . During genome elimination crosses in other plant species , micronuclei are commonly observed ( Subrahmanyam and Kasha , 1973; Gernand et al . , 2005 ) . We dissected embryos from a genome elimination cross and observed one to four micronuclei per cell ( Figure 4E , F ) in 81% of the embryos ( n = 110 ) , but none in embryos from control crosses ( n = 21 , p < 0 . 001 ) . The presence of micronuclei suggests that sub-compartmentalized lagging chromosomes can be shattered by double stranded DNA breaks , reassembled haphazardly by non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) , and finally restituted into the main nucleus ( Crasta et al . , 2012 ) . In order to reconstruct breakpoint junctions , we sequenced FRAG00062 to 100× coverage , extracted read pairs from the ends of duplicated and triplicated blocks and performed de novo assembly . 38 such junctions were assembled ( Supplementary file 4 ) and a random subset of 12/12 were confirmed by PCR ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) followed by Sanger sequencing to demonstrate the accuracy of the de novo assembly . All reconstructed junctions were consistent with NHEJ with either microhomology , observed as 2–15 bp of sequence overlap ( Hastings et al . , 2009 ) , blunt fusions , or unidentified sequence insertions ( Figure 5B ) . We also observed inversions ( fragments that join in head to head or tail to tail orientation ) in 47% of our breakpoint junctions ( Supplementary file 4 ) . The size distributions of microhomology tracts and insertions are indicated in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06516 . 014Figure 5 .

( D ) Distribution of the sizes of unidentified inserted DNA sequences from breakpoint junctions grouped in 25 bp bins . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06516 . 016 Overall , triplicated block sizes from FRAG00062 were significantly smaller than duplicated blocks ( n = 23 in both cases , with p < 0 . 001 , Figure 5C ) and these triplications cannot be easily explained from a missegregated chromosome . Duplicated and triplicated blocks could therefore , have different origins . To address this question , we asked whether breakpoint junctions of the two different copy number states display differential association to various genomic and chromatin features such as genes and repeated elements ( Lamesch et al . , 2012 ) , DNA replication origins ( Costas et al . , 2011 ) , DNase I hypersensitive sites ( DHS ) ( Zhang et al . , 2012 ) and nine non-overlapping chromatin states that partition the Arabidopsis genome ( Sequeira-Mendes et al . , 2014 ) ( Supplementary file 5 ) . When analyzing windows of 1000 bp centered around the breakpoints of duplicated blocks , we observed an enrichment in genic DNA ( from 53% background level to 70% , p < 0 . 01 , Figure 5D , F ) . A subtler , but still significant , increase was observed when using larger windows ( 10 , 000 bp , from 53% background level to 62% , p < 0 . 01 , Figure 5F ) . Consistently , 42% of breakpoint junctions from FRAG00062 are predicted to generate chimeric gene products ( Supplementary file 4 ) . In the same analysis , we noted that the breakpoint regions of duplicated and triplicated blocks contained some genomic features that differed in frequency . In particular , replication origins , which occupy less than 1% of 10 , 000 bp windows around the borders of duplicated blocks , are present in almost 8% around the borders of triplicated blocks ( compared to a genome average of 3 . 5% , p < 0 . 05 , Figure 5E , G ) . The association of the breakpoints flanking duplicated DNA to genic DNA and of those flanking triplicated DNA to replication origins suggests the contribution of two distinct mechanisms to restructuring of the same chromosome ( Figure 6 ) . The first , chromothripsis acting through breakage and ligation ( Stephens et al . , 2011; Korbel and Campbell , 2013 ) . The second , chromoanasynthesis , via replication fork collapse and template switching ( Hastings et al . , 2009; Liu et al . , 2011; Kloosterman and Cuppen , 2013 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06516 . 017Figure 6 . The process of genome elimination and connected models for chromosomal rearrangements . Genome elimination ensues when a haploid inducer expressing a variant CENH3 protein mates with the wild type . In many cases , the chromosomes marked by the variant CENH3 missegregate in the embryo and are compartmentalized in micronuclei . DNA damage , NHEJ repair and restitution of the micronucleus to the euploid pole nucleus can result in aneuploidy or diploidy . Alternatively , shattered chromosomes result from chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis . The former involves fragmentation and random ligation , the latter replication fork collapse and microhomology-mediated strand switching . As a consequence , the pulverized and reassembled chromosome forms a single unit and can be meiotically inherited . The schematics for chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis are shown sequentially for convenience , but their order has not been determined . In addition , our results obtained using DNA ligase4-2 mutants suggest that the NHEJ pathway plays an important role in the repair of the haploid inducer chromosomes that contribute to diploid and aneuploid progeny , such that when NHEJ is inhibited , haploid induction frequency increased . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 06516 . 017 Our in silico reconstruction suggests that NHEJ is involved in repairing breaks that occurred on the shattered chromosomes . To test this explanation , we created a haploid inducer carrying a homozygous null mutation in LIG4 ( DNA Ligase IV ) , a conserved component of the canonical NHEJ pathway . Pollinating it with wild-type LIG4/LIG4 pollen ( from Ler gl1-1 ) resulted in normal haploid induction frequencies . However , when mutant lig4-2/lig4-2 pollen was used , the frequency of haploids doubled at the expense of aneuploids and diploids ( Table 1 and Figure 7 ) . This effect was still observed when the seed parent carried the WT allele ( Table 1 ) . It is possible that parental-specific haploinsufficiency results from early loss of the wild-type LIG4 allele located on the chromosome targeted for elimination , which in this case is the maternal chromosome . This result indicates that NHEJ contributes to formation or persistence of aneuploid and diploid progeny and that unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks increase elimination of the haploid inducer genome , similar to observations in mouse-human hybrid genome elimination ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) . We hypothesize that missegregated chromosomes enter a degradative pathway initiated by endonucleolytic breaks . Occasionally , such chromosomes are rescued ( i . e . , restituted to a haploid or diploid nucleus ) through a pathway requiring NHEJ , resulting in aneuploidy . Therefore , more haploids are produced when the NHEJ pathway is impaired ( Figure 6 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 06516 . 018Table 1 .

 Taken together , our results provide evidence for the occurrence of chromosome restructuring ( Cai et al . , 2014; Morrison et al . , 2014 ) when diverged individuals hybridize , identifying a centromere-based mechanism for genomic instability . This phenomenon studied here depends on chimeric CENH3 , but a similar effect was observed when the haploid inducer strain expresses CENH3 of a close species ( Maheshwari et al . , 2015 ) , indicating the effectiveness of natural and artificial variation . While the genesis and fate of restructured chromosomes is difficult to study in humans , their formation , effects , and even transmission in Arabidopsis are within experimental reach , as demonstrated by the enhancing effect of NHEJ mutants on haploid induction . The range of phenotypes , the formation of copy variants and of chimeric genes at junctions , and their occasional meiotic transmission , suggest that catastrophic chromosomal restructuring , could contribute to heritable genetic variation . 
 All plants were grown in Sunshine Professional Mix Peat-Lite Mix 4 ( SunGro Horticulture , Agawam , MA ) under 16hr/8hr light/dark photoperiod in a growth room set at 21°C . F1 seeds from GFP-tailswap crosses were germinated on MS agar plates and 2-week old seedlings were transplanted into soil . The lig4-2 ( SAIL_597_D10 ) line used is in the Col-0 background . Genotyping primers ( 5′ to 3′ ) used to are lig4-2/LP2: GATATGACAAGCCTTGGCATGAATGT , lig4-2/RP: AAAGTGGATGACATCTCGCTG and LB1: GCCTTTTCAGAAATGGATAAATAGCCTTGCTTCC for the left border of the SAIL T-DNA insertion . All DNA samples were extracted from leaves using Nucleon Phytopure kits ( GE Healthcare , Pittsburgh , PA ) . 1 . 5 μg of DNA were used for a PCR-free library preparation using the NEBNext DNA Library reagents with Nextflex-96 indexes ( Bioo Scientific , Austin , TX ) using a PCR-free protocol . 2 μl of each 96-barcoded libraries were pooled and sequenced using the 50 bp protocol on a single lane of Hiseq 2000 at the Vincent J . Coates Genomics Sequencing Laboratory at UC Berkeley . Demultiplexing was performed by the same facility and resulting raw reads were processed with a custom Python script ( Filter_N_Adapter_Trim_Batchmode . py – available from GitHub repository: https://github . com/KorfLab/FRAG_project ) that removes the filtered reads from Cassava 1 . 8 , adapter sequences , reads that contain Ns and trims reads for quality . For dosage plot analyses , 50 bp single reads were mapped to the TAIR10 A . thaliana reference genome sequence using BWA ( Li and Durbin , 2009 ) and default parameters . Dosage variation was detected as previously described ( Henry et al . , 2010 ) , and is described in detail at Bio-protocol ( Tan et al . , 2016 ) . The genomic reference chromosomes were partitioned into consecutive non-overlapping bins of 100 , 000 bp and the percentage of reads mapping to each bin from each sample was recorded . Relative coverage was calculated by dividing the percentage obtained for each bin by either the corresponding mean percentage for all individuals or the corresponding percentage for the control individual . The relative coverage was set at 2 to represent the diploid background copy value . Positions polymorphic between Col-0 and Ler were identified using sequencing reads from a diploid Col/Ler hybrid control , a Ler plant and a Col-0 plant using custom python scripts . Specifically , polymorphic positions were first identified if they were covered at least 25 times in the hybrid reads and contained two alleles , each representing at least 40% of the allelic calls . Reads from the Col-0 and Ler parents were then used to assign alleles to the two parents . Positions were only retained if they were homozygous in both parents ( represented at least 97% of the allelic calls ) and covered at least 6 times in the Col-0 library and at least once in the Ler library . This process resulted in the identification of 107 , 640 SNP positions ( Supplementary file 6 ) . Next , reads from each of the samples were mined for allele calls at these positions and each read was assigned to one or the other parent based on the parental information . If the read did not match either allele , the genotype was reported as ‘na’ . Finally , genotype information was pooled by consecutive , non-overlapping bins of 1 Mb to derive a percentage of Ler allele per bin for each sample . Using this measure , the Col-0/Ler diploid hybrid is expected to exhibit 50% Col-0 across the genome . All analyses were carried out using chromosome spreads from young anthers . BAC contigs specific for A . thaliana chromosomes 1 and 4 were used as painting probes . BAC DNA was labeled with biotin- , digoxigenin- or Cy3- deoxyuridine triphosphate by nick translation as previously described ( Lysak and Mandáková , 2013 ) . Labeled DNA probes were pooled , hybridized to suitable chromosome spreads and visualized using fluorescent microscopy . See Supplementary file 7 for the list of BAC clones used as painting probes . Breakpoints from FRAG00062 were identified using a high-density 500 bp bin-size dosage plot produced using 50 bp reads extracted from 100 bp paired-end sequencing reads of the FRAG00062 library obtained from an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument . Blocks of duplicated or triplicated dosage were defined by eye . A custom script ( batch-specific-junction-search . py – available from GitHub repository: https://github . com/KorfLab/FRAG_project ) was used to extract the sequencing reads mapping within a 2000 bp region around each breakpoint . These sequences were then assembled using the PRICE genome assembler using the standard paired-end assembly setting ( Ruby et al . , 2013 ) . Resulting contigs were aligned to the Arabidopsis reference genome by NCBI-BLASTN and characteristic breakpoint junctions were identified when two halves of a contig mapped disconcordantly to the reference genome . Primers flanking 12 randomly selected breakpoint junctions were designed using Primer3 ( Li and Durbin , 2009 ) based on their respective de novo assembled contigs . Standard PCR procedures were used for amplification using oligo pairs ( Supplementary file 8 ) and GoTaq Green Mastermix ( Promega Corporation , Madison , WI ) on 1 ng DNA from FRAG00062 and FRAG00080 ( a diploid sibling control ) followed by Sanger sequencing . The A . thaliana TAIR10 genome annotation includes genomic locations for various features in Generic Feature Format Version 3 ( GFF ) . Files specifying genes , transposon , satellite repeats , and replication origins were downloaded from the TAIR FTP site ( ftp://ftp . arabidopsis . org//Maps/gbrowse_data/TAIR10/ ) . The GFF file containing the location of mapped replication origins was available from a study by Costas et al . , ( 2011 ) . These GFF files were combined with results about mapped DHS ( Zhang et al . , 2012 ) and details from the recent work by Sequeira-Mendes et al . , ( 2014 ) , which combined various published epigenomic studies to partition the entire genome into nine different chromatin states . Perl scripts were used to convert the DHS and chromatin state information into GFF format , and these scripts , along with the resulting combined GFF file are available from a GitHub repository: https://github . com/KorfLab/FRAG_project . The set of genome features in the combined GFF file were compared to the annotated set of duplicated and triplicated blocks . Various Perl scripts available from the above GitHub repository , along with a GFF representation of all blocks were used to assess the enrichment of genomic features at the breakpoint regions of duplicated/triplicated blocks . Specifically , window sizes of either 1000 or 10 , 000 bp were centered on each breakpoint coordinate , and the number of bp contributed by each feature of interest were summed across all windows . We also calculated the number of bp contributed by each feature outside those windows . Enrichment ratios were then calculated using the percentage of bases occupied by each feature across all windows at breakpoints compared to percentage of the same features that occupy the remaining fraction of the aneuploid chromosome . The p-values were determined by shuffling experiments in which the locations of the breakpoints were randomized 1000 times , with the resulting shuffled ratios compared to the ratios observed in the real data ( Supplementary file 5 ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']",['chromosomes and gene expression'],elife-06516-v3,215,6661,6446,30.98139534883721
176,"This text describes ""The Temporal Compression Effect DuringSocial Interactions""  and provides detailed descriptions about experimental methodologies, behavioral outcomes. However，the abstract lacks concrete examples demonstrating said phenomena therefore I am unable fully understand key points discussed within :   Key Points:       •	TemporalCompression occurs naturally throughout everyday interpersonal communications involving emotional expressions & intentional action planning related specifically toward intended goals achieved upon completion successfully..    (e., Duration Perception)           In conclusion section suggests possible connection exists tussen objective measures reflecting actual durations versus estimates delivered timing accuracy pertaining explicitly designed motor skills utilized frequently occurring natural movement coordination abilities commonly termed 'Time dilation'.","Einstein once joked: “Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute , and it seems like an hour . Sit with a pretty girl for an hour , and it seems like a minute . That’s relativity . ” While it may not have helped explain the space-time continuum , his joke neatly captures how time can appear to pass at different rates . This perception depends in part on the sensory properties of the stimuli we are experiencing . Intense stimuli , such as bright and fast-moving objects , trigger stronger responses in the brain than less intense stimuli , and so we perceive them as longer lasting . But what role do we , as the experiencers , play in how we perceive time ? To find out , Liu , Yuan , Chen et al . showed volunteers pairs of movie clips , each featuring two human figures outlined by dots . In one clip , the two figures interacted socially , for example by passing an object between them . In the other , the two figures moved independently of each other . The volunteers had to decide which clip lasted longer . The volunteers generally judged clips containing social interactions to be shorter than those without such interactions , even when this was not the case . Moreover , volunteers with better social skills tended to underestimate the length of the social interaction clips to a greater extent . Previous studies have shown that people who are more social tend to have higher levels of a hormone called oxytocin in their blood . Oxytocin is sometimes referred to as the ‘love hormone’ because it promotes social behavior and bonding . Applying an oxytocin nasal spray to the volunteers who were less socially proficient caused them to perceive the social interaction clips as shorter than before . By contrast , socially proficient volunteers who used a nasal spray that blocks the effects of oxytocin perceived these clips as longer than they had done previously ( although they still judged the clips to be shorter than videos that did not show people interacting ) . The perception of time thus varies between people and may depend at least in part on personality . These results open up a new avenue for studying and manipulating how we process social situations . This could eventually benefit people who struggle with social interactions , such as those with autism spectrum disorders .","Communication through body gestures permeates our daily life . Efficient perception of the message therein reflects one’s social cognitive competency . Here we report that such competency is manifested temporally as shortened subjective duration of social interactions: motion sequences showing agents acting communicatively are perceived to be significantly shorter in duration as compared with those acting noncommunicatively . The strength of this effect is negatively correlated with one’s autistic-like tendency . Critically , intranasal oxytocin administration restores the temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals , whereas the administration of atosiban , a competitive antagonist of oxytocin , diminishes the effect in socially proficient individuals . These findings indicate that perceived time , rather than being a faithful representation of physical time , is highly idiosyncratic and ingrained with one’s personality trait . Moreover , they suggest that oxytocin is involved in mediating time perception of social interaction , further supporting the role of oxytocin in human social cognition . 
 As a joke , Albert Einstein once gave this picture to explain his theory of relativity: “Put your hand on a hot stove for a minute , and it seems like an hour . Sit with a pretty girl for an hour , and it seems like a minute . That's relativity . ” This seemingly intuitive picture has no bearing on the structure of space-time , yet nicely illustrates the now established finding that mental time deviates , sometimes significantly , from physical time ( Eagleman , 2008 ) . To date , the deviation between our experienced time and the physical time has mostly been attributed to sensory properties of the external stimuli ( Eagleman , 2008 ) and their context ( Shi et al . , 2013 ) . It has been proposed that subjective time is ‘warped’ by the neural energy involved in representing sensory inputs ( Eagleman and Pariyadath , 2009; Zhou et al . , 2018 ) . For instance , intense and/or moving stimuli are generally experienced as longer in duration ( Fraisse , 1984 ) as they evoke stronger perceptual responses in cortical neurons ( Mayo and Sommer , 2013 ) . Little is known as to what role , if any , we the experiencers play in the time we experience . Considering our gregarious nature and the ubiquity of social interactions in daily life , we set out to probe this issue by examining time perception of social interactions and the inter-individual differences therein . An important medium of social interaction is body gestures , from which most humans efficiently extract others’ attitudes and intentions even when the gestures are portrayed by only a handful of point lights attached to the head and major joints ( Johansson , 1973 ) . Such efficacy is considered evolutionarily endowed –– Human newborns and infants exhibit a predisposition to attend to the motions of biological entities ( i . e . biological motion ) ( Fox and McDaniel , 1982; Simion et al . , 2008 ) ; and the perception of biological motion engages a specific network of distributed neural areas , particularly the superior temporal sulcus ( STS ) ( Grossman et al . , 2005; Grossman and Blake , 2002; Vaina et al . , 2001 ) that plays an important role in social perception in both monkeys and humans ( Allison et al . , 2000 ) . Meanwhile , inter-individual variation is noteworthy . People with autism characterized by impaired social interaction and communication show both a deficit of biological motion perception ( Blake et al . , 2003; Klin et al . , 2009 ) and abnormalities in the STS ( Zilbovicius et al . , 2006 ) . Social proficiency varies widely even among neurotypical individuals , and is manifested behaviorally as a stable personality trait ( Digman , 1990 ) . This inter-individual variance has been associated with plasma concentrations of oxytocin , a well-documented prosocial neuropeptide , as well as polymorphisms of its receptor gene OXTR ( Andari et al . , 2014; Donaldson and Young , 2008; Modahl et al . , 1998; Parker et al . , 2014; Skuse et al . , 2014; Tost et al . , 2010 ) . Likely through interactions with endogenous oxytocin , intranasally administered oxytocin ( Dal Monte et al . , 2014; Freeman et al . , 2016; Lee and Weerts , 2016; Striepens et al . , 2013 ) is found to alter the processing of social stimuli including biological motion in manners that depend on one’s social proficiency ( Bartz et al . , 2011; Kéri and Benedek , 2009 ) as well as blood oxytocin concentration ( Parker et al . , 2017 ) . There has been limited research on the perceptual processing of social interaction between biological entities , particularly as depicted in biological motion displays . Nonetheless , social interaction is far beyond the movements of individuals . In its simplest form , it involves two agents acting in a meaningful manner: one agent executes a gesture , the other recognizes it and acts accordingly . Temporally adjacent actions generally tend to be inferred as a causal sequence and hence communicative ( Lagnado and Sloman , 2006 ) . But ultimately that social ‘meaning’ is derived from the observer’s interpretations of the agents’ actions and the relationship in between , and is , to a certain degree , subjective in nature . The present study aimed to address the effect of perceived social interaction on subjective time and its relationship with one’s intrinsic social proficiency . In a series of experiments , we carefully manipulated point-light displays of acting agents to dissociate the perception of social interaction and that of biological motion . We assessed temporal perception of such displays in individuals varying in social proficiency , and critically examined the role of oxytocin in this process . Given the aforementioned relationships among social proficiency , oxytocin and neural processing of social stimuli , our hypothesis was that both social proficiency , which reflects endogenous oxytocin level , and exogenous manipulations of oxytocin level would influence the neural efficacy in processing social interactions , and thereby modulate the subjective time of perceived social interactions . 
 As an initial step to qualify the influence of perceived social interaction on subjective duration , we selected 10 point-light displays of motion sequences from the Communicative Interaction Database ( Manera et al . , 2010 ) , each portraying two agents engaging in a communicative interaction that usually involved an object ( triadic interaction , see Materials and methods ) , and made from them an essentially physically matched set of 10 noncommunicative motion sequences by cross-pairing the agents from different interactions ( see Supplementary file 1 ) . Observers were shown two motion sequences in each trial –– one communicative , the other noncommunicative , one after the other in random order –– and were asked to report via button press which ( the first or the second ) appeared longer in duration ( Figure 1 ) . We kept the duration of one motion sequence fixed at 1000 ms ( communicative or noncommunicative , each in 50% of trials in random order ) , and varied the duration of the other one from trial to trial ( from 400 to 1600 ms ) . In different blocks , the two motion sequences were either both shown upright , or both inverted . By assessing which motion sequence observers perceived as being longer in duration , we obtained psychometric curves that depicted the probability of choosing the communicative over the noncommunicative as a function of their physical duration difference ( communicative – noncommunicative ) . The duration difference corresponding to a probability of 50% marks the point of subjective equality ( PSE ) , which would be around 0 if there is no influence of social interaction on time perception . Half the interquartile range of the fitted psychometric function marks difference limen , an index of one’s sensitivity in temporal perception . Twenty-four observers ( 12 females ) performed the duration judgment task in Experiment 1 . In the upright condition , the mean PSE was 69 . 3 ms , significantly above 0 ( t23 = 5 . 60 , p<0 . 001 , Cohen’s d = 1 . 14 , Figure 2A ) . In other words , an upright communicative motion sequence compressed subjective duration such that it needed to be 69 . 3 ms longer to be perceived as equal in duration to an upright noncommunicative motion sequence . In the inverted condition , by contrast , the mean PSE was significantly smaller ( t23 = −5 . 82 , p<0 . 001 , Cohen’s d = −1 . 19 ) and not different from 0 ( t23 = −1 . 51 , p=0 . 15 ) ( Figure 2A ) . Inversion is known to impair the perception of biological motion and thereby social interactions mediated by biological motion , yet does not affect low-level visual features ( Troje and Westhoff , 2006 ) . This result hence verified that the temporal compression effect of perceived social interactions could not be due to low-level non-biological visual features . The data from individual observers conformed with the averaged patterns . They are summarized in Figure 2D , in which each observer’s PSEs from the upright ( y-axis ) and the inverted ( x-axis ) conditions are plotted against each other and shown as a red dot . Most red dots fell above the dashed line of slope 1 , although several of them were close to the dashed line; that is , the observers were largely biased towards perceiving the communicative motion sequences as shorter in duration than the noncommunicative ones when the agents were shown upright as opposed to upside down , despite that the task did not require explicit social processing . Their temporal sensitivities remained unchanged between the two conditions , as indicated by a comparison of the difference limens ( t23 = 0 . 70 , p=0 . 49 ) . The point-light trajectories of two agents acting communicatively ( coordinately ) could be spatially and temporally more correlated than those of two agents acting noncommunicatively ( independently ) ( Bassili , 1976; Chartrand and Bargh , 1999 ) . Extraction of such a spatial-temporal relationship between two upright agents , rather than the social meaning per se , could have caused the observed temporal compression effect . To address this possibility , we conducted Experiments 2 and 3 , where we eliminated the social aspect of the original communicative displays while keeping the spatial-temporal pattern differences between the communicative and the noncommunicative motion sequences unchanged . In Experiment 2 , this was done by inserting a temporal lag of 700 ms in between every two acting agents ( upright and inverted , communicative and noncommunicative ) ( Manera et al . , 2013 ) . In Experiment 3 , we spatially swapped the two agents in each display such that they faced in opposite directions instead of facing each other . The two experiments were otherwise identical to Experiment 1 . Analyses of the results from 48 observers ( 24 in each of Experiments 2 and 3; 27 females ) indicated that neither the temporally delayed ‘communicative’ motion sequences nor the spatially swapped ones altered temporal perception relative to their ‘noncommunicative’ counterparts ( Figure 2B and C ) . The PSEs were not significantly different from 0 regardless of whether the motion sequences were presented upright ( t23s = 1 . 39 and 0 . 34 , ps = 0 . 18 and 0 . 74 , for Experiments 2 and 3 , respectively ) or upside down ( t23s = 0 . 01 and −0 . 14 , ps = 0 . 99 and 0 . 89 , respectively ) . Between the upright and the inverted conditions , there was no significant difference in PSE ( t23s = −1 . 02 and −0 . 28 , ps = 0 . 32 and 0 . 78 , for Experiments 2 and 3 , respectively ) or difference limen ( t23s = −0 . 07 and 0 . 84 , ps = 0 . 95 and 0 . 41 , respectively ) . We also examined individual data and plotted each observer’s PSEs from the upright and the inverted conditions against each other . As shown in Figure 2D , the values fell on both sides of the dashed line of slope 1 and were centered around the origin for both Experiments 2 ( blue squares ) and 3 ( lime triangles ) . Moreover , an omnibus ANOVA of the pooled PSEs across Experiments 1 to 3 confirmed a significant interaction between the vertical orientation of the agents ( upright or inverted ) and experiment ( Experiment 1 , 2 , or 3 ) ( F2 , 69 = 9 . 98 , p<0 . 001 , Cohen’s f = 0 . 54 ) . No such interaction was found with the difference limens ( F2 , 69 = 0 . 23 , p=0 . 80 ) . We hence concluded that the temporal compression effect observed in Experiment 1 was absent in Experiments 2 and 3 . The mere spatial-temporal correlation between the moves of two agents , without a recognizable communicative intention ( disrupted by the temporal and spatial manipulations in Experiments 2 and 3 ) , was insufficient to affect temporal perception . We further verified in a supplementary experiment ( 24 observers; 12 females ) using Michotte-like launching and streaming events ( between two objects ) ( Michotte et al . , 1963 ) that the contingency between the movements of two entities , or the inference of causality , could not account for the temporal compression effect associated with the perception of social interactions ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . On the other hand , the recognition of communicative intention is unlikely to spontaneously occur in all observers . Social communicative ability has been shown to be a continuum that extends from patients with autism into the neurotypical population ( Baron-Cohen , 1995; Frith , 1991; Nummenmaa et al . , 2012; von dem Hagen et al . , 2011 ) . The degree of autistic traits ( or lack of social proficiency ) , as measured by the Autism Spectrum Quotient ( AQ ) , varies substantially even among healthy young adults . Such variance is particularly pronounced in males , who generally score higher than females on the AQ ( Baron-Cohen et al . , 2001 ) . We wondered if the extent of temporal compression induced by the perception of social interactions ( see Figure 2D for inter-individual differences ) was a manifestation of one’s social proficiency . To this end , we recruited a larger sample of 90 male observers and carried out Experiment 4 , which employed the same task as Experiment 1 except that all motion sequences were presented upright ( i . e . , the inverted condition that served as a control in Experiment 1 was not included ) . Each observer’s autistic-like tendency was also assessed with the AQ . Overall , Experiment 4 replicated the temporal compression effect observed in Experiment 1 . The mean PSE was 38 . 5 ms , comparable to that of the male observers in Experiment 1 ( 45 . 8 ms ) and significantly above 0 ( t89 = 6 . 07 , p<0 . 001 , Cohen’s d = 0 . 64 , Figure 3A ) . Critically , inspection of the individual data revealed a significant negative correlation between PSE and AQ score: those with higher AQ scores , namely stronger autistic-like tendencies and lower social proficiencies , were less biased in making duration judgments of the communicative and the noncommunicative motion sequences , and had PSEs closer to 0 ( r90 = −0 . 40 , p<0 . 001 , Figure 3B ) . The median AQ score of this sample was 19 , roughly corresponding to a cut-off between low and intermediate levels of autistic traits ( Baron-Cohen et al . , 2001 ) . A median split of the observers by AQ score showed that the social interaction-induced temporal compression effect was evident in the low AQ group ( AQ scores < 20 , mean PSE = 58 . 9 ms , significantly above 0; t45 = 7 . 06 , p<0 . 001 , Cohen’s d = 1 . 04 ) , yet barely reached statistical significance in the high AQ group ( AQ scores ≥ 20 , mean PSE = 17 . 1 ms , t43 = 2 . 00 , p=0 . 052 ) , with a significant group difference in PSE ( t88 = 3 . 51 , p=0 . 001 , Cohen’s d = 0 . 74 ) , but not difference limen ( t88 = 0 . 53 , p=0 . 60 ) ( Figure 3C ) . These results , while reaffirming the influence of perceived social interactions on subjective duration , highlighted the idiosyncrasy of subjective time for social interactions , and tied it to a stable personality trait –– social proficiency . Autistic traits have been widely associated with reduced levels of oxytocin ( Clark et al . , 2013; Green et al . , 2001; Modahl et al . , 1998; Parker et al . , 2014 ) , and can be ameliorated with intranasal oxytocin administration ( Anagnostou et al . , 2012; Gordon et al . , 2013; Guastella et al . , 2010; Watanabe et al . , 2015; Yatawara et al . , 2016 ) . The link between autistic-like tendency and subjective duration of social interactions thus raises the intriguing question of whether oxytocin plays a role therein . Experiment 5 probed this question by testing if the application of oxytocin would promote the social interaction-induced temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals . The same task as in Experiment 4 was employed . Eighty males with AQ scores larger than or equal to 20 ( range: 20–36 , same cutoff value as in Experiment 4 ) completed the duration judgment task twice , once before and once 40 min after the nasal administration of either oxytocin ( for 40 observers ) or atosiban ( for the other 40 observers ) . Atosiban is a desamino-oxytocin analogue and a competitive oxytocin receptor antagonist ( Sanu and Lamont , 2010 ) , and has been shown to be centrally available when administered intranasally ( Lamont and Kam , 2008; Lundin et al . , 1986 ) . We used it as a comparison treatment and hypothesized that its influence on subjective duration of social interactions , if any , would be in the opposite direction of oxytocin . The results were consistent with our hypotheses . In those treated with oxytocin , the mean PSE significantly increased by 36 . 9 ms ( t39 = 3 . 68 , p=0 . 001 , Cohen’s d = 0 . 58 ) , from 13 . 3 ms at baseline , which was not significantly different from 0 ( t39 = 1 . 34 , p=0 . 19 ) , to 50 . 1 ms after oxytocin administration ( significantly above 0 , t39 = 4 . 22 , p<0 . 001 , Cohen’s d = 0 . 66 ) ( Figure 4A ) . By contrast , in those treated with atosiban , the mean PSE was not significantly different from 0 both at baseline ( 9 . 7 ms , t39 = 1 . 14 , p=0 . 26 ) and after atosiban administration ( −9 . 4 ms , t39 = −1 . 11 , p=0 . 28 ) , yet numerically showed a significant reduction ( t39 = −2 . 24 , p=0 . 031 , Cohen’s d = −0 . 35 ) ( Figure 4B ) . Between the two drug groups , there was a marked difference in the changes in PSEs pre- and post- drug administration ( t78 = 4 . 25 , p<0 . 001 , Cohen’s d = 0 . 95 ) . These effects could not be due to changes of the observers’ temporal sensitivity , as their difference limens remained unaltered before and after drug administration ( t39s = 0 . 35 and −0 . 66 , ps = 0 . 73 and 0 . 51 , for oxytocin and atosiban , respectively ) . Besides , their transient mood states , as reflected by ratings on the Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) scale ( McNair et al . , 1971 ) , were also unaffected by drug condition ( drug condition ×testing session; total mood disturbance: F1 , 78 = 0 . 18 , p=0 . 68; all subscales: ps > 0 . 1 ) . Nonetheless , there is a reason to suspect that the influence of atosiban on socially less proficient individuals , as observed in Experiment 5 , was unreliable –– they were not significantly biased by the social aspect of interactions in making duration judgments to begin with . To further verify if antagonizing the effect of oxytocin would diminish the temporal compression effect of perceived social interactions , we turned to socially proficient individuals . In Experiment 6 , 80 males with AQ scores less than 20 ( range: 10–19 , same cutoff value as in Experiment 4 ) completed the duration judgment task both before and 40 min after the nasal administration of either atosiban ( for 40 observers ) or saline ( for the other 40 observers ) , following the same procedure as in Experiment 5 . Saline served as a placebo control here to address potential confounds including practice and fatigue . At baseline , the observers in both drug groups were significantly biased towards perceiving the communicative motion sequences as shorter in duration than the noncommunicative ones ( mean PSEs = 48 . 6 ms and 54 . 5 ms , t39s = 4 . 32 and 5 . 94 , ps < 0 . 001 , Cohen’s ds = 0 . 68 and 0 . 94 , for atosiban and saline , respectively ) , with no difference in between ( t78 = 0 . 41 , p=0 . 68 ) ( Figure 4C–D ) . After drug treatments , however , a significant group difference emerged ( mean PSEs = 17 . 5 ms and 46 . 8 ms , t78 = 2 . 64 , p=0 . 010 , Cohen’s d = 0 . 59 ) . In those treated with atosiban , the mean PSE dropped significantly by 31 . 1 ms ( t39 = −3 . 90 , p<0 . 001 , Cohen’s d = −0 . 62 ) , albeit still significantly above 0 ( t39 = 2 . 04 , p=0 . 048 , Cohen’s d = 0 . 32 ) ( Figure 4C ) . By contrast , in those treated with saline , the PSEs were unaffected ( t39 = −1 . 13 , p=0 . 26; Figure 4D ) . There was a significant difference between the two drug groups in the changes in PSEs pre- and post- drug administration ( t78 = 2 . 22 , p=0 . 029 , Cohen’s d = 0 . 50 ) . Meanwhile , the difference limens in both groups remained unchanged ( t39s = −1 . 07 and −1 . 11 , ps = 0 . 29 and 0 . 27 , for atosiban and saline , respectively ) , and the POMS ratings were unaffected by drug condition ( drug condition ×testing session; total mood disturbance: F1 , 78 = 0 . 47 , p=0 . 50; all subscales: ps > 0 . 2 ) . We plotted in Figure 4E the distributions of PSEs for individual observers in Experiments 5 and 6 before ( x-axis ) and after ( y-axis ) drug treatment . Their central tendencies are respectively highlighted in Figure 4F , generated by using a standard bootstrapping procedure ( Davison and Hinkley , 1997 ) . The majority of the observers with a high AQ score that were treated with oxytocin ( light brown dots with red circles ) fell around the dashed line of x = 0 on the positive side and above the dashed line of slope 1 . In other words , they were not significantly biased in making duration judgments of communicative and noncommunicative motion sequences before oxytocin administration but became biased towards perceiving the communicative ones as shorter in duration afterwards , and showed increased PSEs . By contrast , the observers with a low AQ score that were treated with atosiban ( dark brown dots with blue circles ) mainly fell on the positive side of the dashed line of y = 0 and somewhat above it , but below the dashed line of slope 1 . Those with a high AQ score that were treated with atosiban ( light brown dots with blue circles ) largely fell around the origin and a bit below the dashed line of slope 1 . There was not much overlap between the observers treated with oxytocin ( dots with red circles ) and those treated with atosiban ( dots with blue circles ) . Roughly in between lay the observers treated with saline ( low AQ individuals , dark brown dots with gray circles ) , who mainly fell around the dashed line of slope 1 in the first quadrant of the x-y plane . 
 As one of many social species , humans seek out companionship and social interactions . The current study demonstrates that such a motive is weaved in our mental representation of time: Motion sequences depicting agents engaging in social interactions tend to be perceived as shorter in duration than those showing agents acting noncommunicatively . This temporal compression effect is independent of the basic visual features or the non-biological properties of the agents ( Experiment 1 ) , or the spatial-temporal correlations in between ( Experiments 2 and 3 ) , and cannot be explained by the inference of causality or the contingency between two entities’ movements ( Supplementary Experiment ) . Rather , it relies on the observer’s intrinsic autistic-like tendency , such that socially less proficient individuals are less susceptible to the effect than socially proficient ones ( Experiment 4 ) . The mechanism underlying this phenomenon critically involves oxytocin . In socially less proficient individuals that overall have lower levels of endogenous oxytocin ( Andari et al . , 2014; Modahl et al . , 1998; Parker et al . , 2014 ) , oxytocin administration promotes the social interaction induced temporal compression effect ( Experiment 5 ) . By contrast , in socially proficient individuals with overall higher levels of endogenous oxytocin , the very effect is diminished following the application of an oxytocin antagonist named atosiban ( Experiment 6 ) . Whereas distortion of time perception has been widely associated with properties of the stimuli ( Eagleman , 2008 ) and the context ( Shi et al . , 2013 ) , these findings provide , to our best knowledge , the first empirical evidence that links the subjective time of an event with a personality trait , namely social proficiency . In doing so , they open up a new avenue to probe automatic processing of complex social interplays at the individual level . Social perception involves multifaceted information processing that culminates in the accurate recognition of others’ dispositions and intensions . It inherently entails the integration of information , including the integration between origin and effect ( causal integration ) , the integration of clues ( e . g . motion cues ) to form impressions , extract intentions , and arrive at judgments ( cognitive algebra ) , etc ( Anderson , 1981; Blythe et al . , 1999; Heider , 1944; Smith , 1984 ) . Autism spectrum disorders have been associated with deficits in sensory integration ( Brandwein et al . , 2013; Gepner and Mestre , 2002 ) , though not with unisensory temporal function per se ( Stevenson et al . , 2014 ) . It is plausible that such deficits cascade into the domain of social interactions and partially cause the aforementioned effects . Multiple brain regions are engaged in social perception , and coordinately enable efficient assessment and interpretation of social signals . They include not only the STS that supports the understanding of actions ( Allison et al . , 2000 ) , but also higher cortical areas like the temporal-parietal junction ( TPJ ) that represents mental states ( Carter and Huettel , 2013 ) and the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex ( dmPFC ) that is implicated in the uniquely human representation of triadic interactions between two minds and an object ( Saxe , 2006 ) . The observed temporal compression effect , being independent of the perception of biological motion , likely arises from these higher stages of social processing ( Cusack et al . , 2015; von der Lühe et al . , 2016 ) . Subjective time has been proposed to be a signature of the amount of energy expended in representing a stimulus ( Eagleman and Pariyadath , 2009 ) . It is plausible that communicative motion sequences are processed with increased efficiency in TPJ and dmPFC relative to motion sequences without a recognizable communicative intention , thus leading to lowered metabolic cost ( Gutnisky and Dragoi , 2008; Laughlin , 2001 ) and shortened subjective duration , particularly in socially proficient individuals . Of note here is that this temporal compression effect can hardly be accounted for by the operation of a dedicated neural module specialized for representing the temporal relationships between events ( Ivry and Schlerf , 2008 ) , since it is specific to the perception of social interactions . Oxytocin partially drives social motivation ( Dölen et al . , 2013 ) and has increasingly been identified as an important modulator of social behaviors ( Carter , 2014; Donaldson and Young , 2008 ) ranging from social recognition ( Oettl et al . , 2016 ) to consolation ( Burkett et al . , 2016 ) and ethnocentrism ( De Dreu et al . , 2011 ) . It has also been linked to repetitive behaviors –– a core feature of autism ( Hollander et al . , 2003; Insel et al . , 1999 ) . Results from human brain imaging studies indicate that the application of oxytocin modulates responses in the STS , TPJ and the prefrontal cortex , among others , in various social cognitive tasks ( Zink and Meyer-Lindenberg , 2012 ) . Such alterations of neural activities presumably facilitate social processing in socially less proficient individuals , where exogenous oxytocin has been shown to exert a more definitive prosocial effect ( Bartz et al . , 2010; Bartz et al . , 2011 ) , thereby giving rise to their shortened subjective duration of social interactions following oxytocin administration . In socially proficient individuals , the influence of exogenous oxytocin is more complicated , even hard to predict and interpret ( Bartz , 2016; Bartz et al . , 2010; Bartz et al . , 2011; Olff et al . , 2013 ) . Nevertheless , we were able to show that antagonizing the effect of endogenous oxytocin with atosiban in this group of observers reduced the temporal compression effect as compared to a placebo control . The comparison between oxytocin and atosiban spoke directly to the role of oxytocin in mediating time perception of social interactions . This finding also adds to and extends the extant pharmacological research on time perception , which has primarily focused on dopamine , serotonin and acetylcholine ( Allman and Meck , 2012; Meck , 1998 ) . We conclude that the perceived duration of social interactions is a product of complex neuroendocrine and neural processes , the exact mechanism awaiting further investigation , and is ingrained with one’s social traits . Subjective time is not only nonuniform , like Einstein alluded to in his analogy , but also idiosyncratic . 
 Seventy-two young adults ( 39 females; mean age ± SD = 22 . 8 ± 2 . 5 years ) participated in Experiments 1 to 3 , 24 in each experiment . Sample sizes were determined by G*Power to be sufficient to detect a large temporal distortion effect in time perception ( d ≥ 0 . 8 ) , at a power larger than 95% . The effect size was estimated based on an earlier study that employed biological motion stimuli and similar psychophysical testing procedures to those in the current study ( Wang and Jiang , 2012 ) . An independent group of 90 males ( 22 . 5 ± 2 . 7 years ) took part in Experiment 4 . In addition , 80 male non-smokers ( 22 . 1 ± 2 . 6 years ) who scored above or equal to 20 on the Autism Spectrum Quotient ( AQ ) ( mean AQ score ±SD = 24 . 9±4 . 3 ) participated in Experiment 5 . Another 80 male non-smokers ( 22 . 8 ± 2 . 3 years ) with AQ scores below 20 ( 15 . 5 ± 2 . 7 ) participated in Experiment 6 . Only males were recruited in Experiments 4–6 for the following reasons: In Experiment 4 , this was done to take advantage of men’s pronounced variance in social proficiency ( Baron-Cohen et al . , 2001 ) . In Experiments 5 and 6 , this was due to pragmatic reasons ( like most intranasal oxytocin studies ) , as oxytocin and atosiban respectively cause and antagonize contractions of the uterus . All participants reported to have normal or corrected-to-normal vision . Those in Experiments 5 and 6 also reported to have no respiratory allergy or upper respiratory infection at the time of testing . They gave informed consent to participate in procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board at Institute of Psychology , Chinese Academy of Sciences . Ten communicative point-light motion sequences ( C1-10 in Supplementary file 1 ) , each portraying two agents of the same gender engaging in either a face-to-face ( dyadic , two motion sequences ) or a person-object-person ( triadic , eight motion sequences ) interaction , were chosen from the Communicative Interaction Database ( Manera et al . , 2010 ) . By cross-pairing the agents of the same gender from different interactions , we produced an essentially physically matched set of 10 noncommunicative motion sequences ( NC1-10 in Supplementary file 1 ) . We verified in an independent group of 24 observers ( half male , 27 . 5 ± 3 . 3 years ) that the noncommunicative motion sequences were perceived as significantly less communicative than the communicative ones ( normalized communicativeness rating: 0 . 37 vs . 0 . 71 , t23 = −8 . 11 , p<0 . 0001 , Cohen’s d = −1 . 66 ) . These twenty motion sequences and their inverted ( upside-down ) counterparts were used in Experiment 1 , shown at 30 frames per second with a visual angle of approximately 6°×9° ( each agent was approximately 2°×9° ) . In Experiments 2 and 3 , a temporally delayed version and a spatially swapped version of the stimuli in Experiment 1 were respectively adopted . Specifically , we introduced a temporal lag of 700 ms ( 21 frames ) in between every two acting agents ( communicative and noncommunicative , upright and inverted ) in Experiment 2 ( Manera et al . , 2013 ) , and spatially swapped the two agents in each display in Experiment 3 such that they faced in opposite directions instead of facing each other . The original upright communicative and noncommunicative motion sequences were employed in Experiments 4–6 . Each trial of the duration judgment task in Experiment 1 began with a fixation on a central cross ( 1°×1° ) for 1000 ms , followed by two sequentially presented motion sequences –– one communicative , the other noncommunicative , in random order with a blank screen of 400–600 ms in between ( Figure 1 ) . One of the motion sequences ( communicative or noncommunicative , each in half of the trials in random order ) was presented for 1000 ms , the other for 400 , 600 , 800 , 1000 , 1200 , 1400 or 1600 ms with equal possibility . That is , the duration difference between the communicative and the noncommunicative motion sequences ranged from −600 ms to 600 ms in steps of 200 ms . Observers were asked to press one of two buttons to indicate which motion sequence ( the first or the second ) was longer in duration , a task that did not require recognitions of the nature of the motion sequences . The next trial began immediately after a response was made . There were 35 trials in each block and a total of 8 blocks . In half of the blocks , the motion sequences were presented upright; in the other half , they were presented upside down . The order of the ‘upright’ and the ‘inverted’ blocks was balanced across observers . There was a short break of 1 to 2 min in between the blocks . Experiments 2 to 6 followed the same procedures as in Experiment 1 except for the followings: In Experiments 2 and 3 , a temporally delayed version and a spatially swapped version of the visual stimuli were respectively used ( see Visual stimuli above ) . As a result of the temporal lag inserted between the acting agents , each motion sequence in Experiment 2 was presented for 700 ms longer than in Experiment 1 on average . In Experiment 4 , observers only completed 4 ‘upright’ blocks . In Experiments 5 and 6 , observers completed 4 ‘upright’ blocks at baseline and another 4 ‘upright’ blocks 40 min after drug treatment ( see Drug Application below ) . They also provided ratings on the Profile of Mood States scale ( McNair et al . , 1971 ) following the duration judgment task both at baseline and after drug treatment . Observers in Experiments 5 and 6 self-administered a single intranasal dose of 24 IU of oxytocin ( ProSpec , >99 . 0% as determined by RP-HPLC , dissolved in saline; three puffs per nostril , each with 4 IU of oxytocin; for half of the observers in Experiment 5 ) , 60 µg of atosiban ( ProSpec , >99 . 0% as determined by RP-HPLC , dissolved in saline; three puffs per nostril , each with 10 µg of atosiban; for half of the observers in Experiments 5 and 6 ) or saline ( three puffs per nostril , for half of the observers in Experiment 6 ) , in a randomized between-subjects manner , after they completed the baseline blocks of the duration judgment task and the Profile of Mood States scale . Neither the participants nor the experimenters were aware of the identity of the drug used . Atosiban is a desamino-oxytocin analogue and a competitive oxytocin receptor antagonist ( Sanu and Lamont , 2010 ) . Both oxytocin ( Dal Monte et al . , 2014; Freeman et al . , 2016; Lee and Weerts , 2016; Striepens et al . , 2013 ) and atosiban ( Lamont and Kam , 2008; Lundin et al . , 1986 ) have been shown to be bioavailable when administered intranasally . Fresh oxytocin and atosiban solutions were made every 3 days during the period of data collection , such that for each participant in the drug administration experiments , the solution he received was prepared in less than 3 days before . The prepared solutions were stored in 10 ml sterilized nasal spray bottles at 4°C until usage . For each observer under each condition , we calculated the proportions that a communicative motion sequence was judged as longer in duration than a noncommunicative one , and fitted them with a Boltzmann sigmoid function f ( x ) =1/ ( 1+exp ( ( x−x0 ) /ω ) ) , where x corresponds to the physical duration difference between a communicative motion sequence and a noncommunicative one ( -600 ms , -400 ms , -200 ms , 0 ms , 200 ms , 400 ms , or 600 ms ) , x0 corresponds to the point of subjective equality ( PSE ) , at which the observer perceived a communicative motion sequence as equal in duration to a noncommunicative one; and half the interquartile range of the fitted function corresponds to difference limen , an index of temporal discrimination sensitivity . PSE and difference limen served as the dependent variables and were subsequently compared between conditions and groups .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']",['neuroscience'],elife-32100-v1,100,6913,6813,69.13

While the roles played by many of these microorganisms have yet to be identified , it is known that they contribute to the health and wellbeing of their host by metabolizing indigestible compounds , producing essential vitamins , and preventing the growth of harmful bacteria . They are important for nutrient and carbon cycling in the environment . The advent of advanced sequencing techniques has made it feasible to study the composition of this microbial community , and to monitor how it changes over time or how it responds to events such as antibiotic treatment . Sequencing studies have been used to highlight the significant differences between microbial communities found in different parts of the body , and to follow the evolution of the gut microbiome from birth . Most of these studies have focused on live animals , so little is known about what happens to the microbiome after its host dies . In particular , it is not known if the changes that occur after death are similar for all individuals . Moreover , the decomposing animal supplies nutrients and carbon to the surrounding ecosystem , but its influence on the microbial community of its immediate environment is not well understood . Now Metcalf et al . have used high-throughput sequencing to study the bacteria and other microorganisms ( such as nematodes and fungi ) in dead and decomposing mice , and also in the soil beneath them , over the course of 48 days . The changes were significant and also consistent across the corpses , with the microbial communities in the corpses influencing those in the soil , and vice versa . Metcalf et al . also showed that these measurements could be used to estimate the postmortem interval ( the time since death ) to within approximately 3 days , which suggests that the work could have applications in forensic science .","Establishing the time since death is critical in every death investigation , yet existing techniques are susceptible to a range of errors and biases . For example , forensic entomology is widely used to assess the postmortem interval ( PMI ) , but errors can range from days to months . Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that avoids many of these limitations . Here we show that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic , measurable , and repeatable in a mouse model system , allowing PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days over 48 days . Our results provide a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system and suggest that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI . 
 Forensic science is concerned with identifying and interpreting physical evidence . Long-standing forms of physical evidence include fingerprints , bloodstains , hairs , fibers , soils , and DNA . However , any object can serve as physical evidence if it provides reliable insight into the activities associated with a death scene or crime . Physical evidence is often of critical importance to a criminal investigation because testimonial evidence , the statements provided by victims , suspects , and witnesses , is frequently incomplete and inaccurate ( Saks and Koehler , 2005 ) . To address these limitations of testimony , an investigator will compare the statements to the interpretation of physical evidence . For example , an investigator will require a suspect to provide an alibi to describe his or her whereabouts during the time period of a crime and compare their statement to mobile phone activity . One of the most difficult forms of physical evidence to establish is the amount of time that has lapsed since death , the postmortem interval ( PMI ) . Establishing the PMI is critical to every death investigation because it facilitates the identification of victims and suspects , the acceptance or rejection of suspect alibis , the distribution of death certificates , and the allocation of assets outlined in wills . However , PMI is difficult to establish because we have a relatively poor understanding of corpse decomposition . To improve the ability to estimate PMI , forensic science has incorporated an ecological perspective . When an animal dies it becomes a large nutrient resource that can support a complex and phylogenetically diverse community of organisms ( Mondor et al . , 2012 ) . As this decomposer community recycles nutrients , the corpse progresses through several forensically recognized stages of decomposition , including Fresh ( before decomposition begins ) , Active Decay , which includes Bloating and Rupture , and Advanced Decay ( Carter et al . , 2007; Parkinson et al . , 2009 ) . Biotic signatures associated with these stages of decomposition , such as the development rate of blow fly larvae ( Amendt et al . , 2007 ) , succession of insects ( Horenstein et al . , 2010 ) , and changes in the biochemistry of corpse-associated ‘gravesoil’ ( Tullis and Goff , 1987; Vass et al . , 1992; Benninger et al . , 2008; Carter et al . , 2008; Horenstein et al . , 2010 ) , can be used to estimate PMI . However , no method is successful in every scenario ( Tibbett and Carter , 2008 ) . For example , limitations of forensic entomology include uncertainty in the interval between death and egg deposition ( Tomberlin et al . , 2011 ) , lack of insects during particular weather events or seasons ( Archer and Elgar , 2003 ) , and region-specific blowfly larval growth curves and insect communities ( Gallagher et al . , 2010 ) . Using microbial community change to track the progression of decomposition may circumvent many of these limitations because microbes are ubiquitous in the environment , located on humans before death , and can be reliably quantified using high-throughput DNA sequencing . Microbes play an important role in decomposition ( Vass , 2001; Hopkins , 2008; Mondor et al . , 2012 ) . For example , from the Fresh stage to the Bloat stage , enteric microbes likely contribute to putrefaction by digesting the corpse macromolecules , which in turn generates metabolic byproducts that cause the corpse to bloat ( Mondor et al . , 2012 ) . Evans proposed that a major shift in microbial communities occurs at the end of bloat when the body cavity ruptures ( Evans , 1963 ) , as this key event likely shifts the abdominal cavity from anaerobic to aerobic . Additionally at the Rupture stage , nutrient rich body fluids are released into the environment often increasing pH ( Carter et al . , 2010 ) likely altering endogenous microbial communities . The microbiology of corpse decomposition can now be investigated in detail by utilizing sequencing advances that enable entire communities to be characterized across the timeline of decomposition . These data will not only allow us to understand the underlying microbial ecology of corpse decomposition , but also the feasibility of using microbes as evidence . We must rigorously test whether microbial community change is sufficiently measurable and directional during decomposition to allow accurate estimates of past events such as the PMI . Recently , Pechal et al . ( 2013 ) demonstrated that skin and mouth bacterial communities followed a consistent trajectory of change during decomposition of three swine corpses over 5 days . Here , we expand upon these initial promising results by characterizing microbial community change in three external sites and one invasively sampled internal site in 40 destructively sampled mouse corpses over 48 days . In addition to characterizing bacterial community change of skin samples , we provide the first high-throughput sequencing characterization of microbial communities in the abdominal cavity and corpse-associated soils . Furthermore , we present the first high-throughput sequencing characterization of microbial eukaryotic community change ( e . g . , fungi , nematodes , and amoeba ) associated with skin sites , the abdominal cavity and corpse-associated soils . We conducted a laboratory experiment to characterize temporal changes in microbial communities associated with mouse corpses as they decomposed on soil under controlled conditions for 48 days . We characterized bacteria , archaea , and microbial eukaryotes using a combination of culture-independent , high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches for each sample . To characterize the composition and diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities , we extracted DNA and sequenced partial 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) genes for each sample . To characterize the microbial eukaryotic community of each sample , we sequenced partial 18S rRNA genes . To accurately characterize these highly diverse microbial communities , we sequenced ∼100 base pairs of both 16S and 18S amplicons at a depth of millions of sequences using the Illumina HiSeq platform . In order to gain species and genus level taxonomic resolution of key taxa , a much longer fragment of the rRNA gene ( roughly 800 base pairs for 16S amplicons and 1200 base pairs for 18S amplicons ) was also sequenced at a level of thousands of sequences for a subset of early and late stage decomposition samples on the Pacific Biosciences RS platform . Together , these data allowed us to assess hypotheses long-held by the forensic community about the role of microbes in corpse decomposition , and rigorously test whether changes in microbial communities are predictable over the timeline of decomposition , which is crucial for assessing whether microbes can be used as a ‘clock’ to estimate PMI . 
 We sampled the microbial communities from the mouse corpse abdominal cavity and skin ( head and torso ) , as well as from the associated gravesoil from five replicate corpses over eight time points that spanned 48 days ( Table 1 , Supplementary file 1A ) . By using a mouse model , we were able to perform a highly replicated experiment with destructive sampling that enabled us to sample both the surface and interior of each corpse at each sampling time point . Importantly , this approach facilitated access to the abdominal cavity prior to natural corpse rupture , and thus our data addresses forensic hypotheses that the abdominal microbes play a key role in corpse decomposition ( Evans , 1963 ) . This approach contrasts with typical forensic studies of decomposition where one to three donated corpses of human or swine ( used as a human model ) are used for experiments where only externally accessible body sites are sampled ( e . g . , Pechal et al . , 2013 ) . A further advantage of using a mouse model system is that the large number of samples allowed us to assess to what extent the intra-individual variation of microbiota that we know is present in living humans and other mammals ( Costello et al . , 2009 ) extends to microbial community change during decomposition . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 003Table 1 .

For Illumina data , we only included samples used in statistical analyses , which required>2500 sequences/sample . Details about each of the individual samples can be found in Supplementary file 1A . Over the duration of our 48-day experiment , mice progressed through all major stages of decomposition ( Figure 1 ) . We assessed the progression of decomposition in two ways . First , we recorded a visual body score estimate for the head and torso according to Megyesi et al . ( 2005 ) at the time samples were collected . Visual body score estimates suggested that day 0 and 3 primarily included mice considered in the Fresh stage . Days 6 , 9 , and 13 included mouse corpses that were primarily scored as Active Decay , including the Bloat stage on ∼days 6–9 . Finally , mice on days 20 , 34 , and 48 were primarily categorized as Advanced Decay ( Figure 1A ) . Second , after the conclusion of the experiment , we measured the pH of soil samples to estimate the timeframe during which the purging of fluids or Rupture had likely occurred . It is well established that decomposition fluids are released from a body during decomposition ( Carter et al . , 2007 ) . These fluids are a pulse of nutrients that increase the pH of the surrounding soil . Measurements of soil pH indicated that Rupture ( Active Decay ) occurred between days 6 and 9 of the experiment ( Figure 1B ) . Overall , we concluded that the mice were in the Fresh stage on approximately days 0–3 , the Active Decay stage on days 6–20 ( with Bloat primarily occurring after day 3 until day 9 and Rupture occurring after day 6 and before day 9 ) and the Advanced Decay on days 20–48 . These stage classifications were used in subsequent analyses . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 004Figure 1 . We used two independent methods to assess stages of decomposition: ( A ) a visual body score estimate of decomposition following the Megyesi Key ( Megyesi et al . , 2005 ) and ( B ) the pH of soil to determine when rupture had occurred . ( A ) visual key estimates for the head ( orange circle ) : Fresh–no discoloration ( 1 point ) ; Active Decay–Discoloration ( 2 points ) , Purging of decomposition fluids out of eyes , nose , or mouth ( 3 points ) , Bloating of neck and/or face ( 4 points ) ; Advanced Decay–Sagging of flesh ( 5 points ) , Sinking of flesh ( 6 points ) , Caving in of flesh ( 7 points ) , Mummification ( 8 points ) . The key for the torso ( blue triangle ) is the same as above except that Bloating of abdominal cavity ( 3 points ) precedes Rupture and/or purging of fluids ( 4 points ) . Gray boxes around points indicate generally with which stage of decay each time point is associated–Fresh ( ∼days 0 , 3 ) , Active Decay ( ∼days 6 , 9 , 13 ) , and Advanced Decay ( ∼days 20 , 34 , 48 ) . ( B ) Average pH of soil over time with standard error . A dramatic increase in pH occurred between day 6 and day 9 , which is when rupture of body fluids and subsequent leakage into the soil likely occurred . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 004 In total , we collected 223 abdominal cavity , skin , corpse-associated soils samples ( gravesoil ) , and no-corpse soil controls . After sequence quality filtering and removal of failed samples and samples with low numbers of sequences , the HiSeq Illumina sequence dataset included 167 samples and 2 , 931 , 901 16S rRNA sequences that represented 4505 OTUs ( Table 1 , Supplementary file 1A ) . After sequence and sample filtering , the 18S dataset included 142 samples and 21 , 254 , 848 18S rRNA sequences that represented 421 OTUs ( Table 1 , Supplementary file 1A ) . Most samples with too few sequences to be included in the final datasets ( i . e . , failures ) were collected at early time points ( e . g . , days 0 and 3 ) when microbial biomass was likely low . This was especially true for eukaryotic skin samples and abdominal cavity swab or liquid samples ( although fecal and cecum day 0 samples worked well as expected for these rich microbial habitats ) . The 16S and 18S Illumina HiSeq datasets were used for downstream statistical analyses ( e . g . , Mantel tests , PERMANOVA tests , and PMI estimates ) . Finally , for better taxonomic resolution via longer sequence reads , we also sequenced 26 samples using Pacific Biosciences sequencing platform resulting in a total of 16 , 250 sequences for 18S and 16S . These data were used separately from the Illumina data to identify highly abundant taxa present during early and late stage decomposition at the genus and species levels ( e . g . , the nematode species Oscheius tipulae ) . It has long been assumed that endogenous gut-associated bacteria dominate cadaver decomposition prior to rupture , following which non-enteric and aerobic ( soil-borne , dermal ) microbes bloom and dominate the community ( Evans , 1963 ) . Rupture is a crucial stage during decomposition , in which bloating due to putrefaction breaks open the abdominal cavity , and is expected to result in shifts of the microbial community because the cavity becomes aerobic . Early culture-based investigations conducted without soil lent support to this assumption by showing that many bacteria exploiting a carcass are members of the gut microbiota ( Ingram and Dainty , 1971; Corry , 1978 ) . Our results also lend support to these long-held hypotheses . During the Bloating Stage ( approximately days 6–9 ) , endogenous anaerobes and facultative anaerobes that are known to be common members of the gut community such as Firmicutes in the families Lactobacillaceae ( e . g . , Lactobacillus ) and Bacteroidetes in the family Bacteroidaceae ( e . g . , Bacteroides ) ( Supplementary file 1B ) increase in the abdominal cavity . However , after rupture occurs ( ∼9 days after the start of the experiment ) , these taxa decrease dramatically , and exposure of the abdominal cavity to oxygen allows aerobes such as members of the Rhizobiales ( Alphaproteobacteria ) in the families Phyllobacteriaceae , Hyphomicrobiaceae , and Brucellaceae ( e . g . Pseudochrobactrum and Ochrobactrum ) to dominate ( Figure 2A , B , Supplementary file 1B ) . Additionally , facultative anaerobes in the Gammaproteobacteria family Enterobacteriaceae such as Serratia , Escherichia , Klebsiella , and Proteus ( Supplementary file 1B ) , which are widely recognized as opportunistic pathogens and are associated with sewage and animal matter ( Leclerc et al . , 2001 ) , become abundant after rupture . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 005Figure 2 . Bacterial community composition changes significantly and consistently over the course of decomposition . ( A ) Relative abundance of phyla of bacteria over time for all body sites .

( B ) The three bacterial families that show the greatest change in abundance over time are plotted for each site .

Results from Mantel tests ( Rho and p values ) show that bacterial community change correlated significantly with time . The point of rupture is marked with a thick vertical black line on each plot . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 005 When corpses rupture they release an ammonia-rich , high nutrient fluid that alters both the pH and nutrient content of the soil ( Meyer et al . , 2013 ) . Accordingly we saw a predictable spike in gravesoil pH from ∼6 . 0 to ∼8 . 5 ( Figure 1B ) and declines in Acidobacteria ( Figure 2A ) , the abundance of which is known to be inversely related to soil pH ( Lauber et al . , 2009 ) . Acidobacteria prefer oligotrophic conditions ( Fierer et al . , 2007 ) and grow much more slowly than most other taxa ( Ward et al . , 2009; Castro et al . , 2010 ) , thus the decline of Acidobacteria may be related to the huge pulse of nutrients into the soil rather than shifts in soil pH . In this study , Alphaproteobacteria abundance ( mainly the Rhizobiales ) increased across the sampling period and became most abundant post-Rupture stage soil samples ( Table 2 ) , suggesting this group prefers a relatively nutrient rich environment and is able to outcompete the Acidobacteria ( Marilley and Aragno , 1999; Klappenbach et al . , 2000; Smit et al . , 2001 ) for the corpse derived resources . Such shifts in taxa composition were typical in these Advanced Decay associated soil communities ( after ∼20 days ) , which were significantly different from the time-zero soil communities as well as the no-corpse soil controls ( Figure 2A , Table 3 , PERMANOVA p value 0 . 007 ) . No-corpse control soils , which were collected throughout the experiment , did not change significantly over time ( Mantel Rho 0 . 05 , p value 0 . 35 ) , linking soil community change to the presence of a corpse . Though preliminary , our work suggests that it may be possible to identify gravesoil by an increase in the abundance of copiotrophic taxa relative to oligotrophic taxa . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 006Table 2 .

For the 18S skin of head , there were not sufficient samples for statistical analysis . Bacterial communities associated with the decomposing corpses became increasingly differentiated from starting communities over time in the abdominal cavity , gravesoil , and skin sites ( Figure 2 , Table 4 , Mantel test Rho values 0 . 36–0 . 55 , p<0 . 001 for all sites ) . Although they did not converge completely , similar taxa became abundant at each sample site in the later stages of decomposition ( Supplementary file 1C—weighted UniFrac distances between sample sites during Advanced Decay were significantly lower than between sites during the Fresh stage , two sample t test <0 . 000001 for each of five comparisons ) . For example , in both soil and skin , several bacterial families within the Bacteroidetes ( Sphingobacteriaceae ) , Alphaproteobacteria ( Brucellaceae , Phyllobacteriaceae , and Hyphomicrobiaceae ) , and Betaproteobacteria ( Alcaligenaceae ) increase in abundance during the Advanced Decay stage of decomposition ( Figure 2A , B , Table 2 ) . This trend is consistent with previous findings that bacterial skin communities are often a reflection of the surrounding environment with which they are in contact ( Costello et al . , 2009; Song et al . , 2013 ) , and this convergence may also arise because the low biomass initially found on the skin is easily overwhelmed by soil taxa . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 008Table 4 .

The community of microbial eukaryotes also changed significantly and consistently over the time course of decomposition at all sampled sites except the skin of the torso ( Figure 3A , Table 4 ) . Beginning at approximately 20 days , the microbial eukaryotic community at all sites became dominated by a nematode , O . tipulae , in the family Rhabditidae ( Figure 3B , Tables 2 and 5 ) . Microbial eukaryotic community composition in the no-corpse control soils did not change significantly over time ( correlation with time: Mantel Rho 0 . 15 , p=0 . 13 ) , though diversity did decline in the controls ( Figure 4 ) . Control soils were significantly different from soils associated with corpses in Advanced Decay ( PERMANOVA pseudo-F 5 . 23 , p value 0 . 001 ) . Furthermore , the nematode O . tipulae was not detected at a level of >1% in any control soil sample . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 009Figure 3 .

For soils , the Bonferoni corrected p value for a t test with three comparisons was 0 . 017 . For bacterial communities , PD alpha diversity decreased at each sample site between the Fresh and Advanced Decay stages . For microbial eukaryotic communities , changes in PD alpha diversity were variable across sample sites—decreasing for soil , no significant change for the abdominal cavity , and increasing for skin . However , for Shannon diversity ( evenness ) , microbial eukaryotic communities significantly decreased between the Fresh and Advanced Decay stages at every site ( data not shown , soil p<0 . 001 , abdominal p=0 . 002 , skin p=0 . 03 ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 011 O . tipulae , a bacterivorous representative of the family Rhabditidae , is considered a common nematode species of terrestrial habitats such as soil , leaf litter , and compost all over the world ( Baille et al . , 2008 ) . As a consequence of the nematode bloom , Shannon diversity ( community evenness ) declines at all sample sites for eukaryotic communities ( t test Fresh Stage vs Advanced Decay stage decomposition: soil p<0 . 001 , abdominal p=0 . 002 , skin p=0 . 03 ) . Phylogenetic distance diversity estimates were variable across sample sites with a significant decrease only detected in soil ( Figure 4 ) . The nematode bloom is decoupled from rupture , and it appears that this generalist consumer of bacteria responds to the increase in bacterial biomass that is associated with decomposition ( Benninger et al . , 2008; Carter et al . , 2008 , 2010; Parkinson et al . , 2009; Damann et al . , 2012 ) and outcompetes other community members . One potential contributing factor to the nematode bloom may have been the fact that the mouse graves were relatively closed systems that would have prevented entry of organisms preying on nematodes . Future experiments with open systems will be necessary to determine the impact of higher trophic levels on community dynamics . Because consistent shifts in the presence and abundance of specific bacterial and eukaryotic taxa occurred during known stages of decomposition , these data suggested that succession of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic communities may be used to estimate PMI . By regressing known postmortem interval directly on the taxon relative abundances using a Random Forests model . Random Forests is a machine learning technique that creates random decision trees based on subsets of the features ( e . g . , taxa ) in the data , then chooses the subsets of features that are best able to classify samples into predefined groups using only part of the data . This technique has been useful in other microbial ecology studies , providing high classifier accuracy ( Knights et al . , 2011 ) . We discovered that the temporal change in microbial communities of the skin of the head allowed us to estimate PMI within as little as 3 . 30 +/− 2 . 52 days ( mean absolute error +/− standard deviation ) ( Figure 5 ) . Regressions performed for the timeframe of 0–34 days resulted in the smallest mean absolute error ( Supplementary file 1D ) , which suggests that microbes may be more highly informative for estimating PMI during the earlier stages of decomposition , at least for the sites we sampled . However , this trend may also be due to less frequent sampling events between days 13–48 . It may be possible to further improve error estimates with more frequent sampling . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 012Figure 5 . Estimates of the mean absolute error ( MAE ) and standard deviations for PMI regressed directly on the taxon relative abundances ( in days ) based on bacterial ( ‘bac’ ) and eukaryotic ( ‘euk’ ) microbiome composition for each sampled site— soil ( brown ) , abdominal cavity ( teal ) , skin of the head ( red ) , and skin of the body ( pink ) . Results are show for the timeframe of 0–34 days , which produced smallest errors . Results are displayed with the smallest MAE shown at the top ( skin of head with combined 16S and 18S data ) and largest error at the bottom ( 18S abdominal data ) . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 012 For both 16S and 18S datasets , skin and soil sites were more informative for estimating PMI than data from the abdominal cavity ( Figure 5 , Supplementary file 1D ) . This observation was initially surprising because the marked shifts from anaerobic to aerobic communities that occurred in the abdomen would appear to be a good marker of timing . However , these major microbial changes , which correspond to the time of Rupture , occurred at different times for the replicate corpses in the experiment ( Figures 2 , 3 and 6A ) , and this variability likely reduced the usefulness of the abdominal data for estimating PMI . 10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 013Figure 6 . Trends of the postmortem interval ( PMI ) estimates . ( A ) A regression of PMI predictions vs true PMI using 16S data . The line represents a perfect prediction of PMI . The abdominal cavity shows the greatest scatter of points deviating from the line . ( B ) Estimates of the mean absolute error ( MAE ) for PMI predictions using subsets of highly predictive bacterial taxa . Results suggest that 5–10 highly predictive taxa are required to recover MAEs similar to those generated using the entire microbial community . Similar results were discovered for 18S data , but results are not shown . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 01104 . 013 Overall , bacteria did not perform significantly better in our PMI estimates than microbial eukaryotes ( Supplementary file 1D; two tailed , Wilcoxon signed rank test ) and combining both 16S and 18S datasets resulted in the best estimates of PMI ( Figure 5 , Supplementary file 1D ) , although the improvement was not significant ( Supplementary file 1D ) . For each sample site , we estimated the ‘importance’ of each taxon , a measure of its contribution to the PMI estimate , by removing each taxon from the predictive model and calculating the mean percent increase in mean squared error ( Supplementary file 1E ) . For bacteria , taxa in the Order Rhizobiales were among the most important predictive taxa at each sample site . For microbial eukaryotes , Oscheius was the most important taxon for skin and abdominal sites and the second most important for gravesoil . Fungal taxa of the family Boletales were the most important contributors to PMI regressions for gravesoil . An analysis of models built using small numbers of highly predictive taxa indicates that 5–10 taxa provide approximately the same prediction accuracy as models built with all taxa , as assessed by leave-one-out analyses ( Figure 6B ) . This holds across domains and sample sites , and identifying diagnostic taxa may be a fruitful avenue for forensic investigation . Future studies involving varied habitat conditions , soil types , etc are needed to identify the most general subset of predictive taxa . In all regression analyses , we directly evaluated the predictive strength of the fitted models by holding out one sample , fitting a regression using the remaining n–1 samples , and then using the fitted model to predict PMI for the held out sample . This is a more rigorous inference task than simply fitting a regression to all points jointly; it directly assesses the ability of the model to generalize to data it has not seen before . This distinguishes our approach from prior work in which regression models were evaluated by their ability to explain variation in all data points , after being fit to all data points ( Pechal et al . , 2013 ) . We have provided a proof-of-principle demonstration that microbial community ecology of decomposing corpses has potential to be developed into a complementary forensics tool for estimation of PMI . Additionally , we have provided the first bacterial high-throughput sequence time-series dataset for the abdominal cavity and gravesoil as well as the first microbial eukaryotic high-throughput sequence time-series dataset for the abdominal cavity , gravesoil , and skin sites of a decomposing animal . We also demonstrated that combining complementary sequencing technologies yields high-resolution taxonomic data . Furthermore , the approach described here has several advantages that make widespread adoption of these techniques likely in the future , including continued rapid decline in the cost of DNA sequencing and the ease and familiarity of swab-based sampling at potential crime scenes to law enforcement officers . Given the accuracy of our estimates of PMI , our work suggests a potentially expanded role for microbiological forensic indicators within the criminal justice system . However , the degree to which microbial community changes are sensitive to factors including environmental and edaphic conditions , variation in the human microbiome , and differences among host species , remain to be established in future work . It is promising that Pechal et al . ( 2013 ) recently discovered a similar consistent change of skin bacterial communities on three decomposing swine in an outdoor setting . Future studies are crucial because previous forensic investigations using traditional indicators has shown that environmental parameters such as temperature , moisture , soil type , and soil texture can affect the rate at which decomposition occurs and the ability of decomposer organisms to function ( Carter et al . , 2008 , 2010 ) . It is likely that these parameters will affect postmortem microbial communities . Consequently , the relationship between these parameters , decomposition , and postmortem microbial communities must be understood to develop a method to estimate PMI that is admissible as physical evidence within the criminal justice system . However , the present work strongly indicates that decomposition is sufficiently reproducible as an indicator of PMI to motivate these additional studies . 
 We performed a laboratory experiment in which 40 mice were allowed to decompose on soil graves in the University of Colorado Transgenic Facility , which provides a clean , well-controlled environment . Mice ( strain B6C3F1 ) ranged in age from 36–109 days old and were co-housed by date of birth . To avoid biases by age or relatedness , mice were randomly assigned to one of the eight destructive sampling events . Mice were humanely sacrificed using CO2 gas followed by cervical dislocation and placed on their right side on top of approximately 200–300 × g of soil in a clean 500 ml plastic ( Tupperware-type ) container with a small hole drilled into each side above soil level to prevent anaerobic conditions . Soil ( pH ∼6 ) was collected from the organic layer of a dry creek bed in Eldorado Creek near Boulder , Colorado and brought to ∼55–60% water holding capacity . We destructively sampled five mice across eight time points over 48 days with sampling events occurring more frequently ( every 3 days ) over the first 2 weeks when the rate of decomposition was greatest . At each time point before sampling the five mouse corpses , we recorded a visual body score estimate for the head and torso following Megyesi et al . ( 2005 ) . The head of mice were scored using the following key: Fresh: no discoloration ( 1 point ) ; Active Decay ( early decomposition ) : Discoloration ( 2 points ) , Purging of decomposition fluids out of eyes , nose , or mouth ( 3 points ) , Bloating of neck and/or face ( 4 points ) ; Advanced Decay: Sagging of flesh ( 5 points ) , Sinking of flesh ( 6 points ) , Caving in of flesh ( 7 points ) , Mummification ( 8 points ) . The key for the torso is the same as above except that Bloating of abdominal cavity ( 3 points ) precedes Rupture and/or purging of fluids ( 4 points ) . ( Supplementary file 1A , columns ‘KEY_HEAD’ and ‘KEY_TORSO’ ) . At each time point , microbial communities of corpses were sampled at one internal and two external body sites while still in an aboveground position on the gravesoil . Sterile swabs ( BD BBL , CultureSwab , Becton Dickinson , USA ) were used to sample the skin of the head near the mouth and the skin of the belly . Swabs were vigorously rubbed across each skin site . To sample the internal abdominal cavity , we utilized two techniques depending on whether the abdominal cavity could hold liquid or not . In early time points ( abdominal cavity integrity , day 0–20 ) , we used a 26 G 1 ml syringe with 0 . 5 ml of saline to flush and extract microbes from the abdominal cavity . For later time points ( day 34 and 48 ) , we made an incision into the cavity and used a swab to sample the site . For day 34 , we utilized both sampling techniques . We also sampled soil from underneath each mouse corpse during the experiment . Immediately after sampling and removing the corpse , surface soil was sampled from under the mouse for a total of four samples associated with each decomposing mouse corpse ( or five samples total for mice for which two abdominal samples were taken ) . Additionally , we collected soil samples at days 0 , 6 , 20 , and 48 from a set of no-corpse control soils that were set up the same as the mice graves ( ∼200–300 × g of soil in a clean 500 ml plastic container ) . For each soil sample , we suspended 1 × g of each soil sample in 5 ml of deionized water and measured pH using an Orion 3 Star benchtop pH meter ( Thermo Scientific , USA ) . For each sample , triplicate pH measurements were averaged for a final pH estimate for each sample . The mouse corpse and associated samples were frozen immediately after collection and remained at −20°C until further processing . DNA extraction , amplicon generation , and amplicon preparation for sequencing followed the protocols recorded in Caporaso et al . ( 2011 ) and can be found on the Earth Microbiome Project ( EMP ) webpage ( http://www . earthmicrobiome . org/emp-standard-protocols/ ) . Soil samples ( ∼0 . 30 × g ) , abdominal liquid , and abdominal and skin swabs were extracted using the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit ( Mo Bio Laboratories , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) at the University of Colorado , Boulder . For HiSeq Illumina sequencing , total genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification ( in triplicate ) targeting an informative portion of the 16S rRNA variable region 4 ( V4 ) using the bacterial primer set 515F/806R ( http://www . earthmicrobiome . org/emp-standard-protocols/16s/ ) . 18S primers were based on Amaral-Zettler et al . ( 2009 ) , Euk1391f ( GTACACACCGCCCGTC ) and EukBr ( TGATCCTTCTGCAGGTTCACCTAC ) . A blocking primer specific to mammals was used to minimize amplification of host DNA ( GCCCGTCGCTACTACCGATTGGIIIIITTAGTGAGGCCCT C3 Spacer ) , with the design based on Vestheim and Jarman ( 2008 ) as described in the EMP 18S protocol . All primers for amplification and sequencing are available at ( http://www . earthmicrobiome . org/emp-standard-protocols/18s/ ) . For both 16S and 18S , each set of triplicate PCR reactions were subsequently pooled and quantified using Picogreen Quant-iT ( Invitrogen , Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY , USA ) . Negative controls included no template controls for DNA extraction and PCR amplification . Finally , barcoded amplicons were pooled in equal concentrations for each amplicon type ( 16S and 18S ) . Each amplicon pool was purified using the Mobio UltraClean PCR Clean-up kit ( Mo Bio laboratories , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and sequenced using two lanes of the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform at the BioFrontiers Institute Next-Generation Genomics Facility at University of Colorado , Boulder . For sequencing of longer amplicons , we amplified genomic DNA with two primer sets to better determine the taxonomic identity of abundant bacteria and eukaryotes . 16S was targeted with the universal primer set 515f/1391r and 18S was targeted by the primer set 515f/EukBr . PCR amplification and pooling were similar to that described for Illumina sequencing , and detailed primer information and protocols are available on the resources page of qiime . org under long read amplicons ( https://s3 . amazonaws . com/s3-qiime_tutorial_files/454_FLXplus_protocols_13_4 . tgz ) . Pooled amplicons were sequenced by Pacific Biosciences ( Menlo Park , CA , USA ) . Pooled amplicons were made into SMRTbell libraries followed by the PacBio SMRTbell template preparation protocol and be available at ( https://s3 . amazonaws . com/files . pacb . com/pdf/Procedure_Checklist_2kb_Template_Preparation_and_Sequencing . pdf ) . Briefly , after repaired the ends of pooled amplicons , the amplicons then ligate to PacBio SMRTbell adapters to form SMRTbell templates . The templates were then cleaned and purified by Exonuclease treatment and Ampure Bead purification ( Agencourt , Beckman Coulter Life Sciences , Indianapolis , IN , USA ) . The final SMRTbell libraries were bound to PacBioC2 polymerase and sequenced on PacBio RS using C2 sequencing chemistry and 2 × 45 min acquisition time .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results and discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['ecology', 'microbiology and infectious disease']",elife-01104-v1,76,7347,7271,96.67105263157895

As a result , outside temperatures can also affect the spread of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes . This has left scientists wondering how climate change may affect the spread of mosquito-borne diseases . Predicting the effects of climate change on such diseases is tricky , because many interacting factors , including temperatures and rainfall , affect mosquito populations . Also , rising temperatures do not always have a positive effect on mosquitoes – they may help mosquitoes initially , but it can get too warm even for these animals . Climate change could affect the Ross River virus , the most common mosquito-borne disease in Australia . The virus infects 2 , 000 to 9 , 000 people each year and can cause long-term joint pain and disability . Currently , the virus spreads year-round in tropical , northern Australia and seasonally in temperate , southern Australia . Large outbreaks have occurred outside of Australia , and scientists are worried it could spread worldwide . Now , Shocket et al . have built a model that predicts how the spread of Ross River virus changes with temperature . Shocket et al . used data from laboratory experiments that measured mosquito and virus performance across a broad range of temperatures . The experiments showed that ~26°C ( 80°F ) is the optimal temperature for mosquitoes to spread the Ross River virus . Temperatures below 17°C ( 63°F ) and above 32°C ( 89°F ) hamper the spread of the virus . These temperature ranges match the current disease patterns in Australia where human cases peak in March . This is two months after the country’s average temperature reaches the optimal level and about how long it takes mosquito populations to grow , infect people , and for symptoms to develop . Because northern Australia is already near the optimal temperature for mosquitos to spread the Ross River virus , any climate warming should decrease transmission there . But warming temperatures could increase the disease’s transmission in the southern part of the country , where most people live . The model Shocket et al . created may help the Australian government and mosquito control agencies better plan for the future .","Thermal biology predicts that vector-borne disease transmission peaks at intermediate temperatures and declines at high and low temperatures . However , thermal optima and limits remain unknown for most vector-borne pathogens . We built a mechanistic model for the thermal response of Ross River virus , an important mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia , Pacific Islands , and potentially at risk of emerging worldwide . Transmission peaks at moderate temperatures ( 26 . 4°C ) and declines to zero at thermal limits ( 17 . 0 and 31 . 5°C ) . The model accurately predicts that transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas , resulting in the nationwide seasonal peak in human cases . Climate warming will likely increase transmission in temperate areas ( where most Australians live ) but decrease transmission in tropical areas where mean temperatures are already near the thermal optimum . These results illustrate the importance of nonlinear models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change . 
 The natural history of RRV is complex: transmission occurs across a range of climates ( tropical , subtropical , and temperate ) and habitats ( urban and rural , coastal and inland ) and via many vertebrate reservoir and vector species ( Claflin and Webb , 2015 ) . Marsupials are generally considered the critical reservoirs for maintaining the virus between human outbreaks , but recent work has argued that placental mammals and birds may be equally important in many locations ( Stephenson et al . , 2018 ) . The virus has been isolated from over 40 mosquito species in nature , and 10 species transmit it in laboratory studies ( Harley et al . , 2001; Russell , 2002 ) . However , four species are responsible for most transmission to humans ( Culex annulirostris , Aedes [Ochlerotatus] vigilax , Ae . [O . ] notoscriptus , and Ae . [O . ] camptorhynchus ) , with two additional species implicated in outbreaks ( Ae . [Stegomyia] polynesiensis and Ae . [O . ] normanensis ) . The vectors differ in climate and habitat niches , leading to geographic variation in associations with outbreaks . We assembled and mapped records of RRV outbreaks in humans attributed to different vector species ( Figure 1 , Figure 1—source data 1 ) ( Rosen et al . , 1981; Campbell et al . , 1989; Russell et al . , 1991; Yang et al . , 2009; Lindsay et al . , 1993b; Lindsay et al . , 1993a; Lindsay et al . , 1996; Lindsay et al . , 2007; McManus et al . , 1992; Merianos et al . , 1992; Whelan et al . , 1992; Whelan et al . , 1995 , Whelan et al . , 1997; McDonnell et al . , 1994; Russell , 1994; Russell , 2002; Dhileepan , 1996; Ritchie et al . , 1997; Brokenshire et al . , 2000; Ryan et al . , 2000; Harley et al . , 2000; Harley et al . , 2001; Kelly-Hope et al . , 2004a; Frances et al . , 2004; Biggs and Mottram , 2008; Jacups et al . , 2008b; Schmaedick et al . , 2008; Lau et al . , 2017 ) . Ae . vigilax and Ae . notoscriptus were more commonly implicated in transmission in tropical and subtropical zones , Ae . camptorhynchus in temperate zones , and Cx . annulirostris throughout all climatic zones . Freshwater-breeding Cx . annulirostris has been implicated in transmission across both inland and coastal areas , while saltmarsh mosquitoes Ae . vigilax and Ae . camptorhynchus have been implicated only in coastal areas ( Russell , 2002 ) and inland areas affected by salinization from agriculture ( Biggs and Mottram , 2008; Carver et al . , 2009 ) . Peri-domestic , container-breeding Ae . notoscriptus has been implicated in urban epidemics ( Russell , 2002 ) . The vectors also differ in their seasonality: Ae . camptorhynchus populations peak earlier and in cooler temperatures than Ae . vigilax , leading to seasonal succession where they overlap ( Yang et al . , 2009; Russell , 1998 ) . This latitudinal and temporal variation suggests that vector species may have different thermal optima and/or niche breadths . If so , temperature may impact disease transmission differently for each species . Transmission depends on a suite of vector , pathogen , and human traits , including mosquito density ( M ) . Our main model ( ‘full R0 Model , ’ Equation 1 ) assumes temperature drives mosquito density and includes the relevant life history trait thermal responses ( Parham and Michael , 2009; Mordecai et al . , 2013; Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) . We initially compare this model to an alternative ( ‘constant M model , ’ Equation 2 ) where mosquito density does not depend on temperature . We make this comparison because many transmission models do not include the thermal responses for mosquito density , assuming it depends primarily on habitat availability . Here , we focus on the relative influence of temperature on transmission potential , recognizing that absolute R0 also depends on other factors . Accordingly , we scaled model output between zero and one ( ‘relative R0’ ) . Relative R0 describes thermal suitability for transmission . Combined with factors like breeding habitat availability , vector control , humidity , human and reservoir host density , host immune status , and mosquito exposure , relative R0 can be used to predict disease incidence . In this approach , only the relative thermal response of each trait influences R0 , which is desirable since traits can differ substantially due to other factors and in laboratory versus field settings ( particularly mosquito survival: Clements and Paterson , 1981 ) . Relative R0 does not provide a threshold for sustained disease transmission ( i . e . where absolute R0 = 1 ) , since this threshold is not controlled solely by temperature . Instead , relative R0 preserves the temperature-dependence of R0 to provide three key temperature values: upper and lower thermal limits where transmission is possible ( R0 >0; a conservative threshold where transmission is not excluded by high or low temperatures ) and the temperature that maximizes R0 . 
 Vector and pathogen traits that drive transmission consistently responded to temperature ( Figure 2 ) , though data were sparse ( McDonald et al . , 1980; Mottram et al . , 1986; Russell , 1986; Rae , 1990; Kay and Jennings , 2002 ) . Although we exhaustively searched for experiments with trait measurements at three or more constant temperatures in the Australian vector species ( Cx . annulirostris , Ae . vigilax , Ae . camptorhynchus , Ae . notoscriptus , and Ae . normanensis ) , no species had data for all necessary traits ( Figure 1 ) . Thus , we combined traits from two species to build composite R0 models . We used mosquito life history traits measured in Cx . annulirostris: fecundity ( as eggs per female per day , EFD ) , egg survival ( as the proportion of rafts that hatch , pRH , and the number of larvae emerging per viable raft , nLR ) , the proportion surviving from larvae-to-adulthood ( pLA ) , mosquito development rate ( MDR ) , adult mosquito lifespan ( lf ) , and biting rate ( a ) . We used infection traits measured in Ae . vigilax: vector competence ( bc ) and parasite development rate ( PDR ) . For comparison , we also fit traits for other mosquito and virus species: MDR and pLA from Ae . camptorhynchus and Ae . notoscriptus , and PDR and bc from Murray Valley encephalitis virus ( another important pathogen transmitted by these mosquitoes in Australia ) in Cx . annulirostris ( Figure 2—figure supplements 2 , 3 and 4 ) ( Kay et al . , 1989; Barton and Aberton , 2005; Williams and Rau , 2011 ) . We used sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential impact of this vector mismatch . However , all spatial and temporal predictions of R0 ( Figures 5–7 ) use the full R0 model parameterized with mosquito life history traits from Cx . annulirostris and infection traits from Ae . vigilax ( as shown in Figure 2 ) . Thermal optima ranged from 23 . 4°C for adult lifespan ( lf ) to 33 . 0°C for parasite development rate ( PDR; Figure 2 ) . The data supported unimodal thermal responses for most traits , though declines at high temperatures were not directly observed for biting rate ( a ) and parasite development rate . Data from other mosquito species and ectotherm physiology theory imply these traits must decline at very high temperatures , so we used strong priors to make them decline near ~40°C . Because our approach is designed to identify which traits constrain transmission at thermal limits , this choice is conservative since it means R0 will be limited by other traits with better data . Accordingly , in the absence of data we preferred to overestimate upper thermal limits and underestimate lower thermal limits rather than vice versa . Transmission potential ( relative R0 from the full R0 model ) peaked at 26 . 4°C , and was positive from 17 . 0–31 . 5°C ( Figure 3 ) . Removing the temperature-dependence of mosquito density [M] did not substantially affect the peak , because the optima for transmission and mosquito density were closely aligned ( constant M model: 26 . 6°C , M: 26 . 2°C ) . By contrast , the range of temperatures suitable for transmission is much larger when mosquito density does not depend on temperature because M ( T ) constrains transmission at the thermal limits ( constant M model positive from 12 . 9–33 . 7°C ) . The thermal constraints that mosquito density imposes on transmission are important because , although demographic traits are well-known to vary with temperature in the laboratory , many temperature-dependent transmission models do not assume that temperature influences mosquito density ( Martens et al . , 1997; Craig et al . , 1999; Paull et al . , 2017; Caminade et al . , 2017; Hamlet et al . , 2018 , but see Parham and Michael , 2009; Mordecai et al . , 2013 , Mordecai et al . , 2017; Johnson et al . , 2015 ) . The moderate optimal temperature for RRV ( 26–27°C ) fits within the range of thermal optima found for other diseases: malaria transmission by Anopheles spp . at 25°C , and dengue and other viruses by Ae . aegypti and Ae . albopictus at 29 and 26°C , respectively ( Figure 4 ) ( Mordecai et al . , 2013; Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) . At the upper thermal limit fecundity ( EFD ) and adult lifespan ( lf ) constrain R0 , while at the lower thermal limit fecundity , larval survival ( pLA ) , egg survival ( raft viability [pRH] and survival within rafts [nLR] ) , and adult lifespan constrain R0 ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . All of these traits ( except adult lifespan ) only occur in , and adult lifespan is quantitatively more important in , the full R0 model , illustrating the importance of incorporating effects of temperature on vector life history . Correspondingly , uncertainty in these traits generated the most uncertainty in R0 at the respective thermal limits ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2C ) . The optimal temperature for R0 was most sensitive to the thermal response of adult lifespan . Near the optimum , most uncertainty in R0 was due to uncertainty in the thermal responses of biting rate and egg raft viability . For comparison , substituting larval traits from alternative vectors or infection traits for Murray Valley Encephalitis virus did not substantially alter the R0 thermal response , since Cx . annulirostris life history traits strongly constrained transmission ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . Temperature suitability for RRV transmission varies seasonally across Australia , based on the full R0 model ( Equation 1 ) using monthly mean temperatures from WorldClim . In subtropical and temperate locations ( Brisbane and further south ) , low temperatures force R0 to zero for part of the year ( Figures 5A and 6 ) . Monthly mean temperatures in these areas fall along the increasing portion of the R0 curve for the entire year , so thermal suitability for transmission increases with temperature . By contrast , in tropical , northern Australia ( Darwin and Cairns ) , the temperature remains suitable throughout the year ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . Darwin is the only major city where mean temperatures exceed the thermal optimum , and thereby depress transmission . Because most Australians live in southern , temperate areas , country-scale transmission is strongly seasonal . Using the average ( 1992–2013 ) seasonal incidence at the national scale , human cases peak two months after population-weighted R0 ( T ) , matching our a priori hypothesized time lag between temperature suitability and human cases ( based on empirical work in other mosquito-borne disease systems , see Materials and methods and Discussion; Figure 7 ) . 
 As the climate warms , it is critical to understand effects of temperature on transmission of mosquito-borne disease , particularly as new mosquito-borne pathogens emerge and spread worldwide . Identifying transmission optima and limits by characterizing nonlinear thermal responses , rather than simply assuming that transmission increases with temperature , can more accurately predict geographic , seasonal , and interannual variation in disease . Thermal responses vary substantially among diseases and vector species ( Mordecai et al . , 2013; Mordecai et al . , 2017; Tesla et al . , in press ) , yet we lack mechanistic models based on empirical , unimodal thermal responses for many diseases and vectors . Here , we parameterized a temperature-dependent model for transmission of RRV ( Figure 2 ) with data from two important vector species ( Cx . annulirostris and Ae . vigilax; Figure 1 ) . The optimal temperature for transmission is moderate ( 26–27°C; Figure 3 ) , and largely determined by the thermal response of adult mosquito lifespan ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Both low and high temperatures limit transmission due to low mosquito fecundity and survival at all life stages—thermal responses that are often ignored in transmission models ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . Temperature explains the geography of year-round endemic versus seasonally epidemic disease ( Figures 5 and 6 ) and accurately predicts the seasonality of human cases at the national scale ( Figure 7 ) . Thus , the model for RRV transmission provides a mechanistic link between geographic and seasonal variation in temperature and broad-scale patterns of disease . While the thermal response of RRV transmission generally matched those of other mosquito-borne pathogens , there were some key differences . The moderate optimal temperature for RRV ( 26–27°C ) fit within the range of thermal optima found for other diseases using the same methods: malaria transmission by Anopheles spp . at 25°C , and dengue and other viruses by Ae . aegypti and Ae . albopictus at 29 and 26°C , respectively ( Figure 4 ) ( Mordecai et al . , 2013; Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) . For all of these diseases , the specific optimal temperature was largely determined by the thermal response of adult lifespan ( Mordecai et al . , 2013 , ;Mordecai et al . , 2017; Johnson et al . , 2015 ) . However , the traits that set the thermal limits for RRV transmission differed from other systems . The lower thermal limit for RRV was constrained by fecundity and survival at all stages , while the upper thermal limit was constrained by fecundity and adult lifespan . By contrast , thermal limits for malaria transmission were set by parasite development rate at cool temperatures and egg-to-adulthood survival at high temperatures ( Mordecai et al . , 2013 ) . As with previous models , the upper and lower thermal limits of RRV transmission are more uncertain than the optimum ( Figure 3 ) ( Johnson et al . , 2015; Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) , because trait responses are harder to measure near their thermal limits where survival is low and development is slow or incomplete . Overall , our results support a general pattern of intermediate thermal optima for transmission where the well-resolved optimal temperature is driven by adult mosquito lifespan , but upper and lower thermal limits are more uncertain and may be determined by unique traits for different vector–pathogen systems . Additionally , upper thermal limits of mosquito-borne disease transmission ( a major concern for climate change ) are primarily determined by vector life history traits with symmetrical thermal performance curves ( like fecundity and survival at various life stages ) rather than rate-based traits with asymmetrical thermal performance curves ( like biting rate or pathogen development rate ) . The trait thermal response data were limited in two keys ways . First , two traits ( fecundity and adult lifespan ) had data from only three temperatures . We used priors derived from data from other mosquito species to minimize over-fitting and better represent the true uncertainty ( Figure 2 , versus uniform priors in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . However , data from more temperatures would increase our confidence in the fitted thermal responses . Second , no vector species had data for all traits ( Figure 1 ) , so we combined mosquito traits from Cx . annulirostris and pathogen infection traits in Ae . vigilax to build composite relative R0 models . Geographic and seasonal variation in vector populations suggests that Ae . camptorhynchus and Ae . vigilax have different thermal niches ( cooler and warmer , respectively ) and Cx . annulirostris has a broader thermal niche ( Figure 1 ) ( Russell , 1998 ) . We need temperature-dependent trait data for more species to test the hypothesis that these niche differences reflect the species’ thermal responses . If true , the current model , parameterized primarily with Cx . annulirostris trait responses , may not accurately predict the thermal responses of transmission by Ae . camptorhynchus and Ae . vigilax . Hypothesized species differences in thermal niche could explain why RRV persists over a wide climatic and latitudinal gradient . Thus , thermal response experiments with other RRV vectors are a critical area for future research . The temperature-dependent R0 model provides a mechanistic explanation for independently-observed patterns of RRV transmission across Australia . As predicted by the model ( Figures 5 and 6 ) , RRV is endemic in tropical Australia , with little seasonal variation in transmission potential due to temperature , and seasonally epidemic in subtropical and temperate Australia ( Weinstein , 1997 ) . The model also accurately predicts disease seasonality at the national scale ( Figure 7 ) , reproducing the a priori predicted lag ( 8–10 weeks , or 2 months ) for temperature to affect reported human cases ( Hu et al . , 2006; Jacups et al . , 2008b; Stewart Ibarra et al . , 2013; Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) . This lag between temperature and reported human cases arises from the time it takes for mosquito populations to increase , bite humans and reservoir hosts , acquire RRV , become infectious , and bite subsequent hosts; for pathogens to incubate with vectors; for humans to potentially develop symptoms , seek treatment , and report cases . Further , RRV transmission by Cx . annulirostris in inland areas often moves south as temperatures increase from spring into summer ( Russell , 1998 ) , matching the model prediction ( Figure 6 ) . Although temperature is often invoked as a potential driver for these types of patterns , it is difficult to establish causality from statistical inference alone , particularly if temperature and disease both exhibit strong seasonality and could both be responding to another latent driver . Thus , the mechanistic model is a critical piece of evidence linking temperature to patterns of disease . In addition to explaining broad-scale patterns , the unimodal thermal model explains previously contradictory local-scale results . Specifically , statistical evidence for temperature impacts on local time series of cases is mixed . RRV incidence is often—but not always—positively associated with warmer temperatures ( Tong and Hu , 2001; Tong et al . , 2002a; Tong et al . , 2004; Hu et al . , 2004; Hu et al . , 2010; Jacups et al . , 2008b , Williams et al . , 2009; Werner et al . , 2012; Koolhof et al . , 2017 ) . However , variation in the effects of temperature on transmission across space and time is expected from an intermediate thermal optimum , especially when observed temperatures are near or varying around the optimum . The strongest statistical signal of temperature on disease is expected in temperate regions where mean temperature varies along the rapidly rising portion of the R0 curve ( ~20–25°C ) . If mean temperatures vary both above and below the optimum ( as in Darwin ) , important effects of temperature may be masked in time series models that fit linear responses . Additionally , if temperatures are always relatively suitable ( as in tropical climates ) or unsuitable ( as in very cool temperate climates ) , variation in disease may be due primarily to other factors . A nonlinear mechanistic model is critical for estimating temperature impacts on transmission because the effect of increasing temperature by a few degrees can have a positive , negligible , or negative impact on R0 along different parts of the thermal response curve . Although field-based evidence for unimodal thermal responses in vector-borne disease is rare ( but see Mordecai et al . , 2013; Perkins et al . , 2015; Peña-García et al . , 2017 ) , there is some evidence for high temperatures constraining RRV transmission and vector populations: outbreaks were less likely with more days above 35°C in part of Queensland ( Gatton et al . , 2005 ) and populations of Cx . annulirostris peaked at 25°C and declined above 32°C in Victoria ( Dhileepan , 1996 ) . Future statistical analyses of RRV cases may benefit from using a nonlinear function for temperature-dependent R0 as a predictor instead of raw temperature ( Figure 6B versus Figure 6A ) . Breeding habitat availability also drives mosquito abundance and mosquito-borne disease . Local rainfall or river flow have been linked to the abundance of RRV vector species ( Barton et al . , 2004; Tall et al . , 2014; Jacups et al . , 2015 ) and RRV disease cases ( Tong and Hu , 2001; Tong et al . , 2002a; Hu et al . , 2004; Kelly-Hope et al . , 2004b; Tong et al . , 2004; Gatton et al . , 2005; Jacups et al . , 2008b; Bi et al . , 2009; Williams et al . , 2009; Werner et al . , 2012 ) , as have high tides in coastal areas with saltmarsh mosquitoes , Ae . vigilax and Ae . camptorhynchus ( Tong and Hu , 2002b; Tong et al . , 2004; Jacups et al . , 2008b; Kokkinn et al . , 2009 ) . Overlaying models of species-specific breeding habitat with temperature-dependent models will better resolve the geographic and seasonal distribution of RRV transmission . Relative R0 peaked at similar temperatures whether or not we assumed mosquito abundance was temperature-dependent ( Equation 1 versus Equation 2 ) ; however , the range of suitable temperatures was much wider for the model that assumed a temperature-independent mosquito population ( Figure 3 ) . Since breeding habitat can only impact vector populations when temperatures do not exclude them , it is critical to consider thermal constraints on mosquito abundance , even when breeding habitat is considered a stronger driver . Nonetheless , many mechanistic , temperature-dependent models of vector-borne disease transmission do not include thermal effects on vector density ( Martens et al . , 1997; Craig et al . , 1999; Paull et al . , 2017; Caminade et al . , 2017; Hamlet et al . , 2018 ) . Our results demonstrate that the decision to exclude these relationships can have a critical impact on model results , especially near thermal limits . Several important gaps remain in our understanding of RRV thermal ecology , in addition to the need for trait thermal response data for more vector species . First , the relative R0 model needs to be more rigorously validated using time series of cases to determine the importance of temperature at finer spatiotemporal scales . These analyses should incorporate daily , seasonal , and spatial temperature variation , including aquatic larval habitat and adult microhabitat temperatures ( Paaijmans et al . , 2010; Cator et al . , 2013; Carrington et al . , 2013; Thomas et al . , 2018 ) . They should also integrate species-specific drivers of breeding habitat availability , like rainfall and tidal patterns , infrastructure ( e . g . drainage ) , and human activities ( e . g . deliberate and accidental water storage ) . Second , translating environmental suitability for transmission into human cases also depends on disease dynamics in reservoir host populations and their impact on immunity . For instance , in Western Australia heavy summer rains can fail to initiate epidemics when low rainfall in the preceding winter depresses recruitment of susceptible juvenile kangaroos ( Mackenzie et al . , 2000 ) . By contrast , large outbreaks occur in southeastern Australia when high rainfall follows a dry year , presumably from higher transmission within relatively unexposed reservoir populations ( Woodruff et al . , 2002 ) . Third , as the climate changes , long-term predictions should consider potential thermal adaption of vectors , since transmission at upper thermal limits is currently limited by vector life history traits . To date , we know very little about standing genetic variation for thermal performance or existing local thermal adaptation in vectors for any disease system . Building vector species-specific R0 models and integrating thermal ecology with other drivers are important next steps for forecasting variation in RRV transmission . These more advanced models are necessary to translate our relative R0 results into predictions of absolute R0 ( i . e . estimating the secondary cases per primary case , and where and when R0 >1 for sustained transmission ) . Nonlinear thermal responses are particularly important for predicting how transmission will change under future climate regimes . Climate warming will likely increase the geographic and seasonal range of transmission potential in temperate , southern Australia where most Australians live . However , climate change will likely decrease transmission potential in tropical areas like Darwin , where moderate warming ( ~3°C ) would push temperatures above the upper thermal limit for transmission for most of the year ( Figure 5 ) . However , the extent of climate-driven declines in transmission will depend on how much Cx . annulirostris and Ae . vigilax can adapt to extend their upper thermal limits and whether warmer-adapted vector species ( e . g . Ae . aegypti and potentially Ae . polynesiensis ) can invade and sustain RRV transmission cycles . Thus , we can predict the response of RRV transmission by current vector species to climate change based on these trait thermal responses . However , future disease dynamics will also depend on vector adaptation , potential vector species invasions , and climate change impacts on sea level and precipitation that drive vector habitat availability . 
 The ‘full R0 model’ ( Equation 1 ) assumes temperature drives mosquito density and includes vector life history trait thermal responses ( Parham and Michael , 2009; Mordecai et al . , 2013; Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) . The ‘constant M model’ ( Equation 2 ) assumes mosquito density ( M ) does not depend on temperature ( Dietz , 1993 ) . There is disagreement in the literature over whether the equation for R0 should contain the square root ( Dietz , 1993; Heffernan et al . , 2005; Smith et al . , 2012 ) . We use the version derived from the next-generation matrix method ( Dietz , 1993 ) in order to be consistent with our previous work in other mosquito-borne disease systems ( Mordecai et al . , 2013; Mordecai et al . , 2017; Johnson et al . , 2015 ) . R0 ( T ) = ( a ( T ) 2bc ( T ) e− μ ( T ) PDR ( T ) EFD ( T ) pEA ( T ) MDR ( T ) N r μ ( T ) 3 ) 1/2R0 ( T ) = ( a ( T ) 2bc ( T ) e− μ ( T ) PDR ( T ) MN r μ ( T ) ) 1/2 In both equations , ( T ) indicates that a parameter depends on temperature , a is mosquito biting rate , bc is vector competence ( proportion of mosquitoes becoming infectious post-exposure ) , µ is adult mosquito mortality rate ( adult lifespan , lf = 1/µ ) , PDR is parasite development rate ( PDR = 1/EIP , the extrinsic incubation period ) , N is human density , and r is the recovery rate at which humans become immune ( all rates are measured in days−1 ) . The latter two terms do not depend on temperature . In the full R0 model , mosquito density ( M ) depends on fecundity ( EFD , eggs per female per day ) , proportion surviving from egg-to-adulthood ( pEA ) , and mosquito development rate ( MDR ) , divided by the square of adult mortality rate ( µ ) ( Parham and Michael , 2009 ) . We calculated pEA as the product of the proportion of egg rafts that hatch ( pRH ) , the number of larvae per raft ( nLR , scaled by the maximum at any temperature to calculate proportional egg survival within-rafts ) , and the proportion of larvae surviving to adulthood ( pLA ) . We digitized previously published trait data ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1; McDonald et al . , 1980; Mottram et al . , 1986; Russell , 1986; Rae , 1990; Kay and Jennings , 2002 ) using the free web-based tool Webplot Digitizer available at: https://automeris . io/WebPlotDigitizer/ . We fit thermal responses of each trait using Bayesian inference with the ‘r2jags’ package ( Plummer , 2003; Su and Yajima , 2009 ) in R ( R Core Team , 2017 ) . Traits with asymmetrical thermal responses were fit as Brière functions: qT ( T–Tmin ) ( Tmax–T ) 1/2 ( Briere et al . , 1999 ) . Traits with symmetrical thermal responses were fit as quadratic functions: -q ( T–Tmin ) ( T–Tmax ) . In both functions of temperature ( T ) , Tmin and Tmax are the critical thermal minimum and maximum , respectively , and q is a rate parameter . For priors we used gamma distributions with hyperparameters derived from thermal responses fit to data from other mosquito species ( Figure 2—source data 2 ) ( Davis , 1932; Jalil , 1972; McLean et al . , 1974; Watts et al . , 1987; Rueda et al . , 1990; Focks et al . , 1993; Joshi , 1996; Teng and Apperson , 2000; Tun-Lin et al . , 2000; Alto and Juliano , 2001; Briegel and Timmermann , 2001; Kamimura et al . , 2002; Calado and Navarro-Silva , 2002; Focks and Barrera , 2006; Wiwatanaratanabutr and Kittayapong , 2006; Lardeux et al . , 2008; Delatte et al . , 2009; Beserra et al . , 2009; Yang et al . , 2009; Westbrook et al . , 2010; Muturi et al . , 2011; Carrington et al . , 2013; Tjaden et al . , 2013; Eisen et al . , 2014; Xiao et al . , 2014; Ezeakacha , 2015; Morin et al . , 2015 ) . These priors allowed us to more accurately represent the fit and uncertainty . Our data did not include declining trait values at high temperatures for biting rate ( a ) and parasite development rate ( PDR ) . Nonetheless , data from other mosquito species ( Mordecai et al . , 2013; Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) and principles of thermal biology ( Dell et al . , 2011 ) imply these traits must decline at high temperatures . Thus , for those traits we included an artificial data point where the trait value approached zero at a very high temperature ( 40°C ) , allowing us to fit the Brière function . We used strongly informative priors to limit the effect of these traits on the upper thermal limit of R0 ( by constraining them to decline near 40°C ) . Because our approach is designed to identify which traits constrain transmission at thermal limits , this choice is conservative by allowing R0 to be limited by other traits with better data . Accordingly , in the absence of data we favored overestimating Tmax and underestimating Tmin over the alternative . For comparison , we also fit all thermal responses with uniform priors ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) ; these results illustrate how the priors affected the results . Bayesian inference produces estimated posterior distributions rather than a single estimated value . Because these distributions can be non-normal and asymmetric , we report and apply medians rather than means , since medians are less sensitive to outlying values in extended tails . However , we plot mean values in the figures because they show a smoother and more visually intuitive representation of where trait and R0 thermal responses go to zero at the upper thermal limit . The means and medians are not substantially different , except at this thermal limit ( see example in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . We conducted sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the full R0 model ( Equation 1 ) to understand how trait thermal responses shape the thermal response of R0 . We examined the sensitivity of R0 two ways . First , we evaluated the impact of each trait by setting it constant while allowing all other traits to vary with temperature . Second , we calculated the partial derivative of R0 with respect to each trait across temperature ( ∂R0/∂X · ∂X/∂T for trait X and temperature T; Equations 3-6 ) . To understand what data would most improve the model , we also calculated the proportion of total uncertainty in R0 due to each trait across temperature . First , we propagated posterior samples from all trait thermal response distributions through to R0 ( T ) and calculated the width of the 95% highest posterior density interval ( HPD interval; a type of credible interval ) of this distribution at each temperature: the ‘full R0 ( T ) uncertainty’ . Next , we sampled each trait from its posterior distribution while setting all other trait thermal responses to their posterior medians , and calculated the posterior distribution of R0 ( T ) and the width of its 95% HPD interval across temperature: the ‘single-trait R0 ( T ) uncertainty’ . Finally , we divided each single-trait R0 ( T ) uncertainty by the full R0 ( T ) uncertainty . The partial derivatives are given below for all traits ( x ) that appear only once in the numerator of R0 ( bc , EFD , pRH , nLR , pLA , MDR; Equation 3 ) , biting rate ( a , Equation 4 ) , parasite development rate ( PDR , Equation 5 ) , and lifespan ( lf , Equation 6 ) . ( 3 ) ∂R0∂x= R02x ( 4 ) ∂R0∂a= R0a ( 5 ) ∂R0∂PDR= R02 lf PDR2 ( 6 ) ∂R0∂lf= R0 ( 1+3PDR ) 2 PDR lf2 We took monthly mean temperatures from WorldClim for seven cities spanning a latitudinal and temperature gradient ( from tropical North to temperate South: Darwin , Cairns , Brisbane , Perth , Sydney , Melbourne , and Hobart ) and calculated the posterior median R0 ( T ) for each month at each location . We also compared the seasonality of a population-weighted R0 ( T ) and nationally aggregated RRV cases . We used 2016 estimates for the fifteen most populous urban areas , which together contain 76 . 6% of Australia’s population ( Australian Bureau of Statistics , 2017 ) . We calculated R0 ( T ) for each location ( as above ) and estimated a population-weighted average . We compared this country-scale estimate of R0 ( T ) with data on mean monthly human cases of RRV nationwide from 1992 to 2013 obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System . We expected a time lag between temperature and reported human cases as mosquito populations increase , bite humans and reservoir hosts , acquire RRV , become infectious , and bite subsequent hosts; after an incubation period , hosts ( potentially ) become symptomatic , seek treatment , and report cases . Empirical work on dengue vectors in Ecuador identified a six-week time lag between temperature and mosquito oviposition ( Stewart Ibarra et al . , 2013 ) . Subsequent mosquito development and incubation periods in mosquitoes and humans likely add another 2–4 week lag before cases appear , resulting in an 8–10 week lag between temperature and observed cases ( Hu et al . , 2006; Jacups et al . , 2008b; Mordecai et al . , 2017 ) . With monthly case data , we hypothesize a two-month time lag between R0 ( T ) and RRV disease cases . To illustrate temperature suitability for RRV transmission across Australia , we mapped the number of months for which relative R0 ( T ) >0 and >0 . 5 for the posterior median , 2 . 5 and 97 . 5% credibility bounds ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) for the full R0 model ( Equation 1 ) . We calculated R0 ( T ) at 0 . 2°C increments and projected it onto the landscape for monthly mean temperatures from WorldClim data at a 5 min resolution ( approximately 10 km2 at the equator ) . Climate data layers were extracted for the geographic area , defined using the Global Administrative Boundaries Databases ( GADM , 2012 ) . We performed map calculations and manipulations in R with packages ‘raster’ ( Hijmans , 2016 ) , ‘maptools’ ( Bivand and Lewin-Koh , 2017 ) , and ‘Rgdal’ ( Bivand et al . , 2017 ) , and rendered GeoTiffs in ArcGIS version 10 . 3 . 1 . In 2000 there was a proposed shift in mosquito taxonomy: several subgenera within the genus Aedes were elevated to genus status ( Wilkerson et al . , 2015 ) . This change affected Aedes vigilax and Aedes camptorhynchus , which were called Ochlerotataus vigilax and Ochlerotatus camptorhynchus for a time by some researchers . More recently , there has been a consensus to return to the previous naming system , so we use Aedes here , although many of the papers we cite use Ochlerotatus instead . The fecundity and adult survival data in McDonald et al . ( 1980 ) were published as time series of one experimental population at each temperature . The resulting data needed to be transformed to fit the corresponding trait thermal responses . For survival , McDonald et al . reported the percent surviving approximately every other day ( hereafter: ‘semi-daily’ ) . We used these data—along with the number of female adults alive on the first day of oviposition at each temperature—to generate a semi-daily time series estimating the number surviving . To generate the dataset that we used to directly fit the thermal responses , we converted this time series into the number of female individuals who died on each day ( i . e . lifespan data ) . For fecundity , McDonald et al . reported semi-daily fecundity data for entire population . Because the population was synchronized , and because mosquitoes lay discrete clutches of eggs separated by several days ( the gonotrophic cycle duration ) , there were many data points when the populations did not produce offspring . These zero-inflated fecundity data are not ideal for fitting thermal responses . Therefore , after digitizing the semi-daily fecundity time series , we binned periods of several days ( the bin size varied by temperature , since the gonotrophic cycle duration varies with temperature ) and took a survival-weighted average within each bin ( so days with more individual mothers contributing to offspring production counted more ) . To generate the dataset that we used to directly fit the thermal responses , we weighted the values within each bin by the mean number of surviving mothers in that bin . This approach allowed us to more accurately reflect daily fecundity averaged over a non-synchronized mosquito population . Note that the variation captured by these data and this approach is not variation between individual adult females , but rather variation by age for the whole population .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials\xa0and\xa0methods']","['ecology', 'epidemiology and global health']",elife-37762-v1,224,7043,6819,31.441964285714285
192,"This text describes ""The development, validation  of biomarkrs predicting therapeutic efficacy. It includes details about identifying molecular alterations involved upon corticosteroid medication usage alongside comprehensive approaches employed towards discovering effective treatments tailored specifically toward individuals suffering chronic illnesses like depression   Summary:   In conclusion，this work presents proof regarding transcriptional modulation achieved utilizing corticosteroids acting primarily outside regular dosage ranges leading ultimately impacting health outcomes pertaining mainly systemic inflammation suppression although additional targets include appetite inhibition hence highlighting broad applicability beyond managing immune responses triggered predominantly because elevated baseline values often characterize conditions treated successfully employing steroids","Several diseases , including asthma , arthritis , some skin conditions , and cancer , are treated with medications called glucocorticoids , which are synthetic versions of human hormones . These drugs are also used to treat people with a condition call adrenal insufficiency who do not produce enough of an important hormone called cortisol . Use of glucocorticoids is very common , the proportion of people in a given country taking them can range from 0 . 5% to 21% of the population depending on the duration of the treatment . But , like any medication , glucocorticoids have both benefits and risks: people who take glucocorticoids for a long time have an increased risk of diabetes , obesity , cardiovascular disease , and death . Because of the risks associated with taking glucocorticoids , it is very important for physicians to tailor the dose to each patient’s needs . Doing this can be tricky , because the levels of glucocorticoids in a patient’s blood are not a good indicator of the medication’s activity in the body . A test that can accurately measure the glucocorticoid activity could help physicians personalize treatment and reduce harmful side effects . As a first step towards developing such a test , Chantzichristos et al . identified a potential way to measure glucocorticoid activity in patient’s blood . In the experiments , blood samples were collected from ten patients with adrenal insufficiency both when they were on no medication , and when they were taking a glucocorticoid to replace their missing hormones . Next , the blood samples were analyzed to determine which genes were turned on and off in each patient with and without the medication . They also compared small molecules in the blood called metabolites and tiny pieces of genetic material called microRNAs that turn genes on and off . The experiments revealed networks of genes , metabolites , and microRNAs that are associated with glucocorticoid activity , and one microRNA called miR-122-5p stood out as a potential way to measure glucocorticoid activity . To verify this microRNA’s usefulness , Chantzichristos et al . looked at levels of miR-122-5p in people participating in three other studies and confirmed that it was a good indicator of the glucocorticoid activity . More research is needed to confirm Chantzichristos et al . ’s findings and to develop a test that can be used by physicians to measure glucocorticoid activity . The microRNA identified , miR-122-5p , has been previously linked to diabetes , so studying it further may also help scientists understand how taking glucocorticoids may increase the risk of developing diabetes and related diseases .","Glucocorticoids are among the most commonly prescribed drugs , but there is no biomarker that can quantify their action . The aim of the study was to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocorticoid action . In a randomized , crossover , single-blind , discovery study , 10 subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency ( and no other endocrinopathies ) were admitted at the in-patient clinic and studied during physiological glucocorticoid exposure and withdrawal . A randomization plan before the first intervention was used . Besides mild physical and/or mental fatigue and salt craving , no serious adverse events were observed . The transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue , plasma miRNAomic , and serum metabolomics were compared between the interventions using integrated multi-omic analysis . We identified a transcriptomic profile derived from two tissues and a multi-omic cluster , both predictive of glucocorticoid exposure . A microRNA ( miR-122-5p ) that was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucocorticoid exposure was identified ( p=0 . 009 ) and replicated in independent studies with varying glucocorticoid exposure ( 0 . 01 ≤ p≤0 . 05 ) . We have generated results that construct the basis for successful discovery of biomarker ( s ) to measure effects of glucocorticoids , allowing strategies to individualize and optimize glucocorticoid therapy , and shedding light on disease etiology related to unphysiological glucocorticoid exposure , such as in cardiovascular disease and obesity .

 Glucocorticoids ( GCs ) have a key role in the metabolic , vascular , and immunological response to stress ( Cain and Cidlowski , 2017; Oster et al . , 2017 ) . GC secretion from the adrenal gland is under tight dynamic control by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and is regulated in a classic circadian pattern ( Cain and Cidlowski , 2017; Oster et al . , 2017 ) . Most actions of GCs are mediated by the ubiquitously expressed GC receptor ( Cain and Cidlowski , 2017; Oster et al . , 2017 ) . The tissue-specific effects of GCs are regulated by many local factors , including pre-receptor metabolism of GCs and the interaction of the GC receptor with tissue-specific transcription factors , or through non-genomic mechanisms ( Cain and Cidlowski , 2017; Oster et al . , 2017 ) . As a result of this complexity , circulating levels of cortisol relate poorly to tissue action of cortisol , and serum cortisol therefore has limited value as a biomarker for GC action ( Karssen et al . , 2001 ) . GCs are among the most commonly prescribed drugs , and GC treatment remains a cornerstone in the management of many rheumatic and inflammatory diseases despite the introduction of modern disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biological immunomodulatory treatment ( Smolen et al . , 2017 ) . GC replacement is essential for survival in patients with various forms of adrenal insufficiency ( Johannsson et al . , 2015 ) . However , metabolic and other side effects of GC treatment or replacement are common ( Björnsdottir et al . , 2011; Fardet et al . , 2012 ) , indicating that current methods to monitor their action and tailor their treatment are inadequate . Unphysiological GC exposure has been implicated in the etiology of several common diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus , hypertension , abdominal obesity , and cardiovascular disease ( Ragnarsson et al . , 2019 ) . Against this background , it is highly desirable to be able to measure and quantify GC action as this might be useful to refine current GC therapy . Biomarkers of GC action will also provide potential mechanistic understanding for the role of GCs in the etiology of many common diseases . Previous attempts to identify biomarkers using metabolomics have identified circulating metabolites associated with GC exposure ( Alwashih et al . , 2017a; Alwashih et al . , 2017b ) . Integrated multi-omic analysis provides increased robustness over analysis of individual ‘omic data sets ( Ideker et al . , 2011 ) . In particular , the identification of groups within one ‘omic ‘layer’ with shared co-regulation within another ‘omic layer implies a functional relationship that can be used both to assess the mechanistical relevance and to support the identification of biomarkers ( Karczewski and Snyder , 2018; Misra et al . , 2018 ) . The aim of this exploratory study was to define multi-omic patterns derived from independent tissues related to GC action and to use these patterns to search for clinically applicable circulating biomarkers of GC action . Subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency , Addison’s disease , lack GC production from the adrenal cortex and can therefore be considered a human GC ‘knock-down’ model ( Figure 1A ) . An experimental study design including subjects with Addison’s disease , standardizing for diurnal variation and food intake , allowed a within-individual comparison between physiological GC exposure and GC withdrawal ( Figure 1B ) . A multi-omic analysis strategy combining data from gene expression in circulation ( peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] ) and an important metabolic tissue , adipose tissue , integrated with circulating microRNAs ( miRNAs ) and metabolites was used to identify putative biomarkers . The strongest putative biomarkers were then replicated in independent study groups with different GC exposure . 
 Similarity network fusion ( SNF ) was used to demonstrate overall similarity between subjects across and between ‘omic layers , prior to analysis ( Appendix 1 and Appendix 1—figure 1 ) . Differential gene expression was associated with GC response in both PBMC and adipose tissue ( Appendix 1 ) . Differential expression of metabolites and miRNA was identified in blood in relation to GC response ( Appendix 1 ) . Differentially expressed ‘omic elements ( DEOEs ) are presented in Table 2 and Supplementary file 1a–d . All DEOEs were used for integrated analysis , and false discovery rate ( FDR ) -corrected DEOEs were used for all other analyses ( Table 2 ) . DEOEs from the PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes were shown to have limited overlap in response to GC but were enriched for shared pathways , revealing an overlap that indicated shared mechanism in relation to GC exposure ( Appendix 2 and Appendix 2—figure 3 ) . We assessed the impact of differential expression on the entire interactome to aid in the identification of similar GC-related function . Interactome network models were generated using differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ) from both the PBMC transcriptome and the adipose tissue transcriptome . These were shown to be consistent with one another ( Appendix 2 and Appendix 2—figures 1 and 2 ) despite the limited overlap of DEGs . GC-responsive genes were shown to have higher connectivity in the human interactome than expected by chance , demonstrated using 10 , 000 permutations of this network model ( Appendix 2 ) . Hypernetworks are network structures where edges are not restricted to defining a relationship between two nodes but may be shared between many nodes . As such , these structures can be used to describe complex relationships that link multiple elements . Hypernetworks also allow for the same pair of nodes to be connected by multiple edges . This means that relationships between nodes can be ranked by the number of edges shared between them . Hypernetworks allow for the summary of correlation matrices , compressing the high-dimensional relationships between data points ( transcripts/miRNA/metabolites ) into a single metric of similarity . Hypernetworks facilitate integration of ‘omic data and can be used to define strongly associated elements . Elements with large numbers of shared edges are more similar and likely to be of functional relevance; clustering allows refinement of large ‘omic data sets to highly associated elements ( Figure 3A , B ) . Hypernetworks are robust to random error and act to filter out false-positive correlations as these will not have a uniform pattern of correlation across all ‘omic elements . To assess similarity , we defined the correlation coefficient between each differentially expressed ‘omic measurement and assessed as 'present' in the network model those correlations with an r-value >| 1 . 5 | standard deviations ( sd ) . Edges were defined as PBMC transcripts with shared correlations , for example , two PBMC transcripts that are both correlated with the same three metabolites are connected by three edges . We summarized the shared correlations as a measure of similarity between each pair of GC-responsive PBMC transcripts , counting correlations across the other ‘omic data sets ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . The greatest number of correlations shared was between PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptome ( 525 genes , Figure 3C ) , reinforcing the observation that , while the gene-level overlap of differential expression was limited , common pathways are active in both tissues related to GC action , which involve similar networks of co-expressed genes . The rank order of the number of correlations shared with the GC-responsive PBMC transcriptome was adipose tissue transcriptome > plasma miRNAome > serum metabolome , and this was confirmed both by comparison of the heat maps ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) and by a Venn diagram ( Figure 3D ) . The Venn diagram also reveals a strong correspondence between the serum metabolome and both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes . Robustness testing was performed in which hypernetworks were generated to model dissimilarity based on the absence of correlations with PBMC transcripts . Any genes that were highlighted by these hypernetworks were removed from the downstream predictive analysis . Using this approach , we defined 271 of 965 PBMC transcripts with maximum predictive potential . This set of genes perfectly classified the HC- and saline-treated groups using partial least squares discriminant analysis ( PLS-DA ) ( Figure 4A ) . We identified variables of importance using Random Forest and modeled the background experimental noise using permutation analysis ( BORUTA ) ( Figure 4B ) . This identified a set of 59 genes as variables of importance with fold changes in the same directions in both transcriptomic data sets that perfectly classified HC from saline treatment ( Supplementary file 1e ) . Nine of these genes were significantly differentially expressed in both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes ( Figure 4C ) , and , of these nine genes , six were associated with GC response via gene ontology ( IL18RAP , JAK2 , MTSS1 , RIN2 , KIF1B , and BCL9L ) ( Figure 4D ) . The gene set ( n = 59 ) that we identified , which classified both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes in relation to GC exposure , was validated ( area under the curve [AUC] 0 . 70–0 . 96 ) by further testing in five other previous studies of GC action by other research groups in cellular models ( Table 3 ) . Further robustness of the random forest observations was provided by demonstrating that the minimal depth at which the variables of importance became active in prediction was small ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . We further examined interactions between the circulating ‘omics data associated with GC exposure ( Figure 3D ) . All of the circulating ‘omics data was combined to form a correlation matrix and hierarchical clustering used to identify ‘omic data points with similar correlation ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) . Eleven clusters including transcriptomic , miRNAomic , and metabolomic data were identified , and these clusters were shown to have enrichment within the interactome network model ( Supplementary file 1f and Appendix 2 ) . We then quantified the number of correlations between all the circulating ‘omic data associated with GC exposure ( n = 336 ) using a hypernetwork . This approach was used to define a group of highly connected multi-omic elements with a relationship to GC exposure ( Figure 5A ) . A hypernetwork model of the core group of 139 highly connected elements was generated ( Figure 5B ) . DCK was the only gene shared with the GC-dependent adipose tissue transcriptome that also had predictive value ( highlighted with a red square in Figure 5B ) . Deletion of the DCK gene region has been shown to be associated with increased sensitivity to GCs ( Malani et al . , 2017 ) , an observation in alignment with the reduction in expression we found in both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes in association with GC exposure ( Figure 4C ) . The hypernetwork model ( Figure 5B ) also highlighted a range of related miRNAs and metabolites . A hierarchical model of modules within the network was assessed using the measure of network centrality ( Figure 5C ) . These modules revealed multi-omic relationships and demonstrated that miR-122-5p was the only miRNA present in higher order modules as measured by network centrality . miR-122-5p was correlated with cortisol exposure and the expression of FKBP5 , a regulator of GC sensitivity ( cluster 11 in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 1f ) . Targeted replication of the plasma miR-122-5p fold change from the experimental study in subjects with Addison’s disease using an independent RNA separation procedure showed a marked down-regulation of miR-122-5p by increased GC exposure ( p=0 . 009 ) ( Figure 6 ) . Two subjects did not show this miR-122-5p response , one man ( disease duration 2 years , body mass index [BMI] 23 . 8 kg/m2; hydrocortisone 20 mg daily , fludrocortisone 0 . 1 mg daily ) and one woman ( disease duration 23 years; BMI 28 . 1 kg/m2; hydrocortisone 30 mg daily , fludrocortisone 0 . 2 mg daily ) who both experienced mild mental fatigue during GC withdrawal . Based on ( i ) the functional association of a circulating miRNA with gene expression and metabolomics , and ( ii ) the correlation between the PBMC transcriptome and plasma miRNAome ( Figure 3D ) , a targeted replication of the plasma miRNA findings was conducted using an independent RNA separation procedure . Twelve miRNAs were re-analyzed in the current study and in three other independent studies including subjects with different GC exposures: ( i ) in 60 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis with and without tertiary adrenal insufficiency after a short-term stop in their GC treatment ( low vs . physiological GC exposure , respectively ) ( Borresen et al . , 2017 ) ; ( ii ) in 20 subjects with Addison’s disease receiving HC replacement therapy and in 20 matched healthy control subjects ( low vs . physiological GC exposure , respectively ) ( Bergthorsdottir et al . , 2017 ) ; and ( iii ) acute low , medium , and excessive GC exposure in 20 healthy subjects ( Stimson et al . , 2017 ) . From this analysis , miR-122-5p was significantly associated with different GC exposure in all studies ( Figure 7A– D ) . The expression of miR-122-5p was higher in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis and reduced GC exposure due to tertiary adrenal insufficiency ( Figure 7A ) , and subjects with Addison’s disease had higher expression of miR-122-5p than healthy matched controls ( Figure 7B ) . In the experimental study in healthy subjects , the expression of miR-122-5p was increased both after low and excessive high GC exposure compared to medium GC exposure at both high and low insulin levels ( Figure 7C , D , respectively ) . The other 11 miRNAs ( including miR-425-3p ) did not show a relationship with GC exposure in the three replication studies . 
 In a clinical experimental study designed to identify biomarkers of GC action , we succeeded in generating two profoundly different states of GC exposure within the physiological range in the same individual . The novelty of this study is the identification of pathways related to GC response and putative biomarkers of GC action in gene expression , metabolome , and miRNAs derived from integrated multi-omic analysis in two independent tissues . We identified a transcriptomic profile that was under similar GC regulation in both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes , which was then validated by comparison to a range of previously published data by other research groups from cellular assays . We also identified a circulating miRNA , miR-122-5p , which was correlated with the circulating transcriptome and metabolome findings , suggesting for the first time a functional role in GC action . Moreover , the association between the expression of miR-122-5p and GC exposure was replicated in three independent study groups . In order to identify putative biomarkers of GC action in humans , a clinical study was considered to be the most appropriate experimental setting . Addison’s disease or primary adrenal insufficiency is a rare disorder , but a unique clinical model for GC biomarker discovery due to absent or very low endogenous GC production ( Gan et al . , 2014; Sævik et al . , 2020 ) . Subjects with Addison’s disease were studied in a random order during physiological GC exposure and GC withdrawal . During GC exposure , infusion of HC delivered in isotonic saline via an infusion pump using a circadian pattern and saline alone ( using the same volume and infusion pattern as during HC infusion ) was administered during the GC withdrawal in order to prevent a state of sodium and fluid deficiency . This study design therefore allowed a within-individual comparison accounting for circadian rhythm and food intake . The marked difference in serum and urinary cortisol and cortisone , and the similar serum electrolytes , glucose , body weight , and blood pressure between the two interventions support the experimental success of the study design and strongly indicate that confounders related to metabolic changes or other secondary events related to the GC exposure or GC withdrawal were not influencing the output of the study . The measurable but very low concentrations of serum cortisol and cortisone throughout the GC withdrawal may be explained by a residual adrenal steroid secretion in some subjects ( Gan et al . , 2014; Sævik et al . , 2020 ) and/or due to conversion of cortisone to cortisol in the liver and adipose tissue ( Stimson et al . , 2014 ) . Network models of ‘omic data can be used as a framework to assess the potential utility of biomarkers ( Stevens et al . , 2014 ) . In this study , we have used a hypernetwork model of GC action based on differential gene expression in PBMCs as a basis to integrate adipose tissue transcriptome , plasma miRNA , and serum metabolomic data . Hypernetwork analysis leverages the power inherent in large data sets to assess interactions between ‘omic elements in a manner that is robust to false positives ( Battiston et al . , 2020 ) . The associated interactome network derived from the PBMC transcriptome was shown to contain a number of genes with previously known GC-dependent binding of NR3C1 ( the GC receptor ) to regulatory elements , evidence that supports the specificity of the study design ( Davis et al . , 2018; Casper et al . , 2018 ) . Gene ontology analysis of the differential gene expression identified a range of pathways classically associated with GC action including GC-receptor signaling , immunoregulatory pathways such as those involving NF-κB , metabolic pathways , and cell cycle pathways . The plasma miRNA and serum metabolomic data was shown to map to the interactome network model of GC action , and this was taken as support for this data being putative circulating biomarkers functionally related to GC action . Differential expression induced by GC treatment in both PBMCs and adipose tissue was indirectly associated with similar downstream elements by gene ontology analysis . These genes were not directly implicated with GC response , so , while the exact mechanisms may be different in each tissue , effects are coordinated through the same elements . Integration of the multi-omic data including both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes was performed in order to increase the robustness of putative markers that could reflect action in other tissues such as adipose tissue , which is an important target organ for the metabolic actions of GCs . The 59 genes that behaved similarly in PBMC and adipose tissue were then validated in a range of studies examining GC response in different cellular systems . These included primary cell culture on keratinocytes ( Stojadinovic et al . , 2007 ) and lens epithelial cells ( Gupta et al . , 2005 ) , along with PBMCs ( Carlet et al . , 2010 ) and cancer cells [both lymphoblastic leukemia ( Carlet et al . , 2010 ) and osteosarcoma ( Lu et al . , 2007; Jewell et al . , 2012 ) ] . The set of nine genes co-regulated in relation to GC exposure and GC withdrawal in both PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes can therefore be considered as putative markers of GC response . These could be used as a gene set to interrogate GC action in other experimental settings . All the miRNA findings in this study are novel . While emerging experimental evidence indicates impact on regulation of GC action at several points by miRNAs ( Clayton et al . , 2018 ) , this is the first time that miRNAs are shown to be globally correlated to GC action in humans . Both the hypernetwork analysis and the interactome network model implied the functional significance of some miRNAs , particularly miR-122-5p . In our hypernetwork model , the expression of miR-122-5p was correlated with clusters of genes that were centrally coordinated by expression of both RNF157 and TBXAS1 , the former suggested to be a key regulator of both PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways , commonly perturbated in cancer and metabolic disorders ( Dogan et al . , 2017 ) . Expression of TBXAS1 is pharmacogenomic linked to inhaled GC exposure in asthma ( Dahlin et al . , 2020 ) . miR-122 is precursor transcript of mature miRNAs , including miR-122-5p ( Carthew and Sontheimer , 2009; Bartel , 2004 ) . miR-122 is expressed in the liver in humans ( Tsai et al . , 2009; GTEx Consortium , 2015; GTEx Consortium , 2013 ) and mice ( Tsai et al . , 2009 ) . Hepatocyte nuclear factor HNF4A ( Li et al . , 2011; Xu et al . , 2010 ) , along with HNF3A ( FOXOA1 ) , HNF3B ( FOXOA2 ) , and HNF1A ( Xu et al . , 2010; Coulouarn et al . , 2009 ) , has been shown to be a key regulator of miR-122 expression in human cells . Down-regulation of miR-122 in murine models has been associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( Alisi et al . , 2011 ) and diabetes mellitus ( Guay et al . , 2011 ) , and in humans , miR-122-5p has also been associated with fatty liver disease ( Raitoharju et al . , 2016 ) . miR-122-5p may be a functional link between unphysiological GC exposure and metabolic and cardiovascular disease . Increased exposure to GCs impairs glucose tolerance and may induce type 2 diabetes ( Hackett et al . , 2014 ) . Indeed , reduced miR-122-5p expression has been seen in animal models of diabetes , and the reduction of this miRNA in response to increased GC exposure may suggest that miR-122-5p is a functional link between GC action and metabolism . In support of these findings are observations showing that miR‐122-5p regulate insulin sensitivity in murine hepatic cells by targeting the insulin‐like growth factor ( IGF ) 1 receptor ( Dong et al . , 2019 ) . Recent human studies have also suggested that miR-122-5p is an indicator of the metabolic syndrome , with reduced expression in response to weight loss in overweight/obese subjects ( Hess et al . , 2020 ) . miR-122-5p has also been suggested as a biomarker of coronary artery stenosis and plaque instability ( Wang et al . , 2019; Singh et al . , 2020; Ling et al . , 2020 ) . As unphysiological GC exposure has been associated with obesity , diabetes , and cardiovascular disease ( Walker , 2007 ) , it is possible that miR-122-5p is reflecting different GC exposure in these disorders . The subjects with Addison’s disease in our clinical experimental study had no other comorbidities previously known to be associated with miR-122-5p expression , and therefore the presence of such confounders in our miR-122-5p finding seems to be unlike . Specific miRNAs circulating in a stable , cell-free form in plasma or serum may serve as biomarkers in some diseases ( Kroh et al . , 2010 ) , and , in our integrated analysis , they seem to be a realistic and clinically useful marker of GC action . We therefore focused on the replication of the miRNA findings from the discovery study . For this purpose , we performed a targeted analysis of 12 putative miRNAs and analyzed them in 120 subjects from independent study groups with different GC exposure in terms of dose , duration of exposure , and route of administration . The rationale for selecting these groups was that their GC exposure mostly remained within the normal physiological range . Despite the experimental differences between these studies , and the fact that these studies were not designed to study miRNA biomarkers of GC action , miR-122-5p was down-regulated by increased GC exposure in all of them . One exception was when short-term excessively high GC exposure was studied in afternoon samples in 20 subjects . There is no clear explanation for this , except the possibility that high non-physiological GC exposure has other secondary effects that may affect the levels of miR-122-5p . The network analysis also identified putative metabolomic markers of GC action . GCs have a key role in metabolic regulation of stress by mobilizing energy through glucose , protein , and lipid metabolism . Previous studies have found an association between different GC doses and levels of branched-chain amino acids , fatty acids , some acyl carnitines , and tryptophan and its metabolites ( Alwashih et al . , 2017a; Sorgdrager et al . , 2018 ) . In our study , the amino acid tyrosine and the pyrimidine base uracil had a central position in the hypernetwork , which defined a group of highly connected multi-omic relationships within physiological GC exposure . Some of the other metabolomic data from our study was also in line with previous metabolomic studies in patients with adrenal insufficiency ( Alwashih et al . , 2017b; Sorgdrager et al . , 2018 ) . Excessive exposure to GCs in healthy subjects has , on the other hand , shown a strong , immediately and long-lasting impact on numerous biological pathways in the metabolome that may be either direct or indirect through the metabolic and cardiovascular action of pharmacological doses of GCs ( Bordag et al . , 2015 ) . There are some study limitations that need to be acknowledged . The low number of subjects included in the clinical experimental study could have reduced the power to detect a putative marker in individual ‘omic data sets , but this limitation was compensated for by the crossover study design and the integration of multi-omic layers . Another limitation is that we have only studied markers collected in the morning during physiologically peak cortisol exposure . However , the strengths of our study are the experimental study design , consideration of diurnal variation in GC action and impact of food intake , and the within-individual comparison , which minimizes confounders , as well as the fact that the putative markers that we have replicated are associated with known GC-responsive genes in two different tissues , suggesting their functional importance in GC action . Moreover , the integration of multi-omic layers allows for the reduction of background noise ( Huang et al . , 2017 ) and forms the basis for a detailed model of GC action . Hypernetwork summaries of correlation networks are recognized as providing signatures of mechanism ( Pearcy et al . , 2016; Johnson , 2011; Butte et al . , 2000; Oldham et al . , 2006 ) and , as such , are useful to assess both function and define markers of direct action . In this clinical biomarker discovery study , we identified genes , miRNA , and metabolites that are differently expressed during GC exposure and GC withdrawal in subjects with Addison’s disease . The multi-omic data showed a high degree of coherence , and network analysis identified transcriptomics and metabolites that were closely correlated . The final outcome of the study is identification of a miRNA that is regulated by GC exposure and correlated with genes and metabolites that are also regulated by GCs in this study , indicating its functional relevance . The replication of this miRNA in three independent study groups increases the likelihood that the discovered miRNA , miR-122-5p , could become a biomarker of GC action to be used in clinical settings . 
 Plasma cortisol and cortisone were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS ) , and urinary-free cortisol and cortisone were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) at the Mass Spectrometry Core Laboratory , Centre for Cardiovascular Science , University of Edinburgh , Edinburgh , UK . PBMCs were isolated on-site from whole blood using a gradient-based separation procedure and Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM ( GE Healthcare ) . A microarray gene expression analysis using Affymetrix Human Gene 2 . 0 ST arrays in both PBMC and adipose tissue was performed at the Array and Analysis Facility , Science for Life Laboratory at Uppsala Biomedical Center ( BMC ) , Sweden . The untargeted miRNA analysis in plasma was performed at Exiqon Services , Denmark . The targeted miRNA analyses in plasma ( including the replication samples ) were performed at Exiqon Services , Denmark , at a later date than the untargeted analysis . The 14 miRNAs included in the analysis based on the findings from the untargeted analysis were miR-425-3p , miR-186-5p , miR-15b-5p , miR-95-3p , miR-16-1-3p , miR-576-5p , miR-122-5p , miR-200a-3p , miR-193b-3p , miR-424-5p , miR-574-3p , miR-148a-3p , miR-18a-5p , and let-7g-5p . Metabolic profiling of serum by GC-MS and LC-MS was performed at the Swedish Metabolomics Center in Umeå , Sweden . Preprocessing of ‘omics data sets was carried out in the following ways . PBMC and adipose tissue transcriptomes were normalized using robust multichip average ( RMA ) via the R package oligo ( Carvalho and Irizarry , 2010 ) , which corrects for background variation , quantile normalizes , and summarizes features to gene-probe set level ( Figure 3—figure supplement 2 ) . GC-MS and LC-MS metabolomic data sets were analyzed using the R package MetaboanalystR ( Chong and Xia , 2018 ) , which filters variables based on ranked interquartile range , normalizes metabolites to sample median , and log transforms the resultant intensities ( Figure 3—figure supplement 3 ) . Qlucore Omics Explorer ( version 3 . 3 , Lund , Sweden ) was used to scale and mean center miRome data . How all these analyses were performed is described in detail in Appendix 3 . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) was performed to provide further quality control and define the relationship of variance between samples , allowing structure within the data set to be defined ( Qlucore Omics Explorer 3 . 3 ) . Quality control of transcriptomic data was performed using PCA with cross-validation and data consistency was confirmed . No outliers were identified . Differential gene expression was determined by a paired t-test comparing the two interventions . Network analysis of DEGs was performed using Advaita Bio’s iPathwayGuide ( https://www . advaitabio . com/ipathwayguide ) ; gene ontology performed using this software analysis tool implements the ‘Impact Analysis’ approach that takes into consideration the direction and type of all signals on a pathway , and the position , role , and type of every gene ( Ahsan and Drăghici , 2017 ) . Gene ontologies were associated with differentially regulated gene lists ( Ingenuity Pathway Analysis [IPA] , Qiagen , Redwood City , CA ) . miRNAs were paired with genes that were theoretically regulated by specific miRNAs using IPA . The databases used for this mapping were TarBase ( Vlachos et al . , 2015 ) , miRecords ( Xiao et al . , 2009 ) , and peer-reviewed biomedical literature , as well as predicted miR–mRNA interactions from TargetScan ( Agarwal et al . , 2015 ) . The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ) data ( Rosenbloom et al . , 2013 ) was used to map genes in the interactome network model of GC action that had been previously shown to have dexamethasone dose-dependent DNA binding of NR3C1 , the GC receptor gene . Causal network analysis ( CNA ) allows the identification and prioritization of regulatory system elements within transcriptomic models . CNA was performed within IPA ( Krämer et al . , 2014 ) . CNA identifies upstream molecules , up to three steps distant , that potentially control the expression of the genes in the data set ( Krämer et al . , 2014 ) . A prediction of the activation state for each regulatory factor ( master regulator ) , based on the direction of change , was calculated ( Z-score ) using the gene expression patterns of the transcription factor and its downstream genes . An absolute Z-score of ≥|1 . 4| and a corrected p-value<0 . 05 ( Fisher’s exact test ) were used to compare the regulators identified . Lists of DEGs were used to generate network models of protein interactions in Cytoscape 2 . 8 . 3 ( Smoot et al . , 2011 ) by inference using the BioGRID ( 3 . 4 . 137 ) database ( Chatr-Aryamontri et al . , 2015 ) . The Cytoscape plug-in Moduland ( Kovács et al . , 2010; Szalay-Beko et al . , 2012 ) was applied to identify overlapping modules , an approach that models complex modular architecture within the human interactome ( Chang et al . , 2013 ) by accounting for the non-discrete nature of network modules ( Kovács et al . , 2010 ) . Modular hierarchy was determined using a centrality score and further assessed using hierarchical network layouts ( summarizing the underlying network topology ) . The central module cores ( metanode of the 10 most central elements ) was determined and used as a basis to integrate the miRNA and metabolomic data . Transcriptomic and metabolomic data were combined to form a single network model using the Metscape ( Karnovsky et al . , 2012 ) plug-in for Cytoscape . Differential ‘omic data was compared and clustered in a correlation matrix using the corrplot plug-in ( Murdoch and Chow , 1996 ) for R ( R Development Core Team , 2020 ) . Subject-level similarity network fusion ( SNF ) ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) was performed on ‘omic data as a test for similarity . To perform SNF , the SNFTool R-package was used ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) . First , Euclidean distances were calculated between gene probe sets , and these were then combined using a nonlinear nearest neighbor method over 20 iterations . The fused data was subjected to spectral clustering and presented as a heat map . We modeled the dynamics of potentially relevant PBMC and adipose tissue transcripts , miRNAs , and metabolites by assessing their activity as measured by the number of shared correlations against the background of all ‘omic elements called present after data processing . A matrix ( m rows and n columns ) was generated of correlation distances ( r-values ) between the significantly differentially expressed multi-omic data ( forming m rows ) and all ‘omic data called present ( forming n columns ) . The r-values were normally distributed . A similarity matrix was defined by dichotomizing the correlation distance based on an r-value threshold of ≥| 1 . 5 |sd ( if sd of | r |≥1 . 5 , then value = 1; if sd of | r |<1 . 5 , then value = 0 ) ; the new matrix was termed M and represents the incidence matrix of the hypernetwork . An element of M , mij , where i and j are elements of m and n respectively , is defined as follows:mij={ 1 , &| r |≥1 . 5 sd0 , &| r |<1 . 5 sd To generate the hypernetwork , we multiplied M by the transpose of M , MT ( Johnson , 2011; Ha et al . , 2020 ) , the elements of the resulting square matrix ( sM , an m×m matrix ) are the number of correlations shared by each pair of interacting ‘omic elements; this is also the number of edges connecting each pair of nodes . sM was clustered using hierarchical clustering to identify the group of highly connected ‘omic elements . The dichotomization parameters were shown to correspond to maximum signal window in the data using chi-squared distance metric ( Figure 3—figure supplement 4 ) . The chi-squared distance ( X 2 ) was defined asΧ2=∑i=1N ( mi−me ) 2mewhere N is the order of the matrix sM , i is the i'th element , mi , of sM , and me is the expected value of an element of sM . The expected value of an element of sM was calculated at any chosen dichotomization threshold by dividing the total number of correlations by the order of the matrix . Differential expression analysis was performed to refine genes for hypernetwork analysis . This approach serves to identify potentially relevant ‘omic elements . FDR-corrected p-values for all elements selected for hypernetwork integration are presented in Supplementary file 1g . We identified 4426 DEGs in PBMCs , 3520 adipose tissue DEGs , 38 metabolites ( 17 LC-MS , 21 GC-MS ) , and 12 miRNAs below an uncorrected p-value of 0 . 05 . Data was analyzed across nine matching samples ( normalized log2 score was inverted between GC exposure and GC withdrawal , i . e . , +1 and –1 , respectively ) . A hypernetwork is inherently robust as individual correlations are not considered significant; rather hypernetworks model higher order interactions between nodes ( ‘omic elements ) based on large numbers of shared edges ( correlations ) . This approach only highlights ‘omic elements that are supported by the majority of the data and , as such , is robust to a wide range of r-value thresholds as well as small sample sizes . Further , robustness of the hypernetwork observations was determined using a dissimilarity matrix derived from the original similarity matrix ( i . e . , the complement of the similarity matrix ) . The elements assessed as dissimilar were subtracted from those defined as similar . Elements within the M×MT output of the dissimilarity analysis that were also similar were eliminated from further predictive analysis . The BORUTA R package ( Kursa , 2014; Kursa and Rudnicki , 2010 ) was used for feature selection of transcriptomic data with predictive value . Random Forest ( Breiman , 2001 ) was implemented in R using 5000 trees to determine the predictive value expressed as the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic . Unsupervised analysis of metabolomic and transcriptomic data to assess how GC exposure grouped the study subjects was performed using Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis in SIMCA 13 . 0 ( Sartorius ) or PLS-DA MixOmics plug-in ( Rohart et al . , 2017 ) for R . For quantitative variables with normal distribution , we performed independent samples t-test . Mann–Whitney U-test was performed for non-normally distributed variables . Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test , as appropriate , was used for categorical variables . Wilcoxon rank test was used for detecting differences between the two interventions in quantitative non-normally distributed variables . All statistical tests were two-sided , and p<0 . 05 was considered to be statistically significant . Further robustness for ‘omic data analysis was provided by considering the findings as clusters of co-expressed findings ( Cleary et al . , 2017 ) . Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS ( Statistical Package for Social Science ) program , version 24 software for Mac . Unless otherwise stated , all other statistical analyses were performed in R version 4 . 0 . 2 for Windows . Figures were plotted using ggplot2 ( Wickham , 2016 ) , gplots ( Warnes et al . , 2020 ) , ggpubr ( Kassambara , 2020 ) , and reshape2 ( Wickham , 2007 ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['medicine', 'computational and systems biology']",elife-62236-v1,95,6950,6855,73.15789473684211

The signals allow cells living in a group to coordinate their behaviors . This cooperation can help all the cells in the group , yet scientists are puzzled about how it could evolve and persist in a population . This is because individual bacteria that essentially cheat and benefit from the cooperation of the rest of the group without contributing their fair share would have a fitness advantage . Now , Majerczyk et al . show that a bacterium called Burkholderia thailandensis , which is commonly found in soil , poisons neighboring freeloaders to prevent such cheating . In the experiments , bacteria with mutations that allow them to ignore the chemical signals that trigger cooperation have an advantage over cooperative bacteria when the two types of bacteria are grown together in a liquid . However , the uncooperative mutants lose their advantage when they are grown on a surface where the cooperative bacteria touch them . To understand why , Majerczyk et al . examined which genes were active in both types of cells in these situations . These experiments showed that chemical signals released by the cooperative bacteria cause them to produce both toxins and proteins that protect against these toxins . This allows the cooperative cells to poison cheaters that they come in contact with , while suffering no ill effects themselves . This allows the cooperative bacteria , via the signaling chemicals , to police cheats and reward only other cooperative bacteria . The next step will be to determine if other types of bacteria also use this policing strategy and to identify more pairs of genes that contribute to protecting the benefits of cooperation .","Burkholderia thailandensis uses acyl-homoserine lactone-mediated quorum sensing systems to regulate hundreds of genes . Here we show that cell-cell contact-dependent type VI secretion ( T6S ) toxin-immunity systems are among those activated by quorum sensing in B . thailandensis . We also demonstrate that T6S is required to constrain proliferation of quorum sensing mutants in colony cocultures of a BtaR1 quorum-sensing signal receptor mutant and its parent . However , the BtaR1 mutant is not constrained by and outcompetes its parent in broth coculture , presumably because no cell contact occurs and there is a metabolic cost associated with quorum sensing gene activation . The increased fitness of the wild type over the BtaR1 mutant during agar surface growth is dependent on an intact T6SS-1 apparatus . Thus , quorum sensing activates B . thailandensis T6SS-1 growth inhibition and this control serves to police and constrain quorum-sensing mutants . This work defines a novel role for T6SSs in intraspecies mutant control . 
 Bacterial quorum sensing ( QS ) often controls factors that benefit cells in groups; it controls cooperative activities . A well-studied type of QS common to a number of Proteobacteria species is mediated by acyl-homoserine lactone ( AHL ) signals . AHLs are made by members of the LuxI family of signal synthases . The AHLs can diffuse in and out of cells . At sufficient cell densities , the AHLs accumulate to concentrations needed for expression of specific genes by binding signal receptors of the LuxR family of transcriptional regulators ( for reviews of QS see ( Fuqua et al . , 1996 ) ) . In some bacterial species , QS controls just a few genes and in others it controls hundreds of genes . Genes for production of secreted or excreted products are overrepresented in AHL quorum sensing regulons . These extracellular products have at least in some cases been shown to serve as public goods . Any member of a group can benefit from the public good regardless of whether that individual has contributed its share of the good ( West et al . , 2006 ) . There is a metabolic cost associated with QS and QS-activation of gene expression . QS control of public goods has been studied in some detail in Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Because QS activates production of extracellular proteases , QS signal receptor mutants have a fitness advantage over the wild type when growth is on milk protein as the sole carbon and energy source ( Diggle et al . , 2007; Sandoz et al . , 2007 ) . The receptor mutant fitness advantage presents a conundrum; how is QS-mediated cooperation preserved ? QS itself can be considered a cooperative trait , the QS signal is a public good , and QS is susceptible to exploitation by QS mutant social cheats . In P . aeruginosa , three mechanisms of QS cheater restraint have been demonstrated . The first is a direct benefit-based strategy called metabolic constraint ( Schuster et al . , 2013; Dandekar et al . , 2012 ) ; Quorum sensing activates genes coding for public goods ( such as extracellular proteases ) , as well as a limited set of privately utilized goods ( such as a hydrolase that allows producing cells to utilize adenosine ) . When cells are supplied with both casein and adenosine , QS signal receptor ( LasR ) mutant cheats are penalized and constrained ( Dandekar et al . , 2012 ) . A second mechanism has been called metabolic prudence ( Xavier et al . , 2011 ) where the QS-controlled public good is only made when it’s production is not costly . Metabolic prudence minimizes the cost of cooperation . Recently , a mechanism whereby P . aeruginosa cooperators punish or police cheats has been described . QS competent cooperators produce cyanide and are more resistant to cyanide than QS mutant cheats , and thus the cooperators can constrain cheats by slowing their growth with cyanide ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) . The P . aeruginosa policing is a rare example of this sort of activity in bacteria , and because cyanide production and resistance has some semblance to a toxin-immunity-like mechanism we hypothesis that QS activation of toxin-immunity systems might have some generality as a policing mechanism where QS bacteria can control QS mutants . We recently used RNAseq to identify genes in the Burkholderia thailandensis QS regulon ( Majerczyk et al . , 2014 ) . B . thailandensis has three AHL QS systems , BtaR1-I1 , BtaR2-I2 and BtaR3-I3 ( Ulrich et al . , 2004; Chandler et al . , 2009; Duerkop et al . , 2009 ) . Together , the QS systems control hundreds of genes . The BtaR1-I1 regulon appears to be the largest as BtaR1 regulates >150 genes ( Majerczyk et al . , 2014 ) . We queried the transcriptomics data and discovered that expression of several genes shown to encode Type VI secretion system ( T6SS ) substrates , including characterized toxins and their cognate immunity or antitoxin genes , are activated by QS . Expression of a toxin and its antitoxin results in a toxin-resistant producer cell , which can deliver toxins via the secretion apparatus via cell-cell contact to a sensitive cell thereby inhibiting growth of the sensitive cell ( Russell et al . , 2014 ) . We show that T6S provides wild-type B . thailandensis with an ability to constrain BtaR1 mutants in a contact-dependent manner . This supports the hypothesis that QS activation of toxin-immunity systems can serve as a policing mechanism to control QS mutants growing among QS competent wild-type cells . Our findings also reveal yet another role for T6S in bacteria . T6S has been shown to provide a competitive interspecies or interstrain advantage , and some T6Ss have been shown to play a role in bacterial virulence ( Schwarz et al . , 2010; 2014 ) . Here we describe intraspecific control of QS mutants . This provides a rationale for why T6S toxin and immunity genes might be under QS control . 
 To assess the fitness of the B . thailandensis QS mutants in competition with their parent , we cocultured the wild type with signal blind QS mutants . We used signal-blind mutants BtaR1- , BtaR2- or BtaR3- ( which each have mutations in the LuxR homolog genes btaR1 , btaR2 , or btaR3 ) because they cannot respond to signals made by QS-proficient bacteria in coculture . The starting inoculum was 99% wild type and 1% signal-blind mutant . Cocultures were transferred to fresh medium at 24 hr intervals as described in the Materials and methods ( there were about 12 doublings per day ) , and at each interval the relative abundance of parent and mutant was determined . After 3 days in broth , the BtaR1- mutant showed an increase from 1% of the total population to 50% ( Figure 1A ) . The BtaR2- and BtaR3- mutants did not have a growth advantage over the parent and remained at about 1% of the population throughout the experiment ( Figure 1A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14712 . 003Figure 1 . Growth of the wild type and QS mutants in LB broth and on an agar surface . ( A ) In LB broth , the wild type ( strain E264 ) was mixed with the BtaR1- mutant CM157 , the BtaR2- mutant CM159 or the BtaR3- mutant CM161 at a starting mutant relative abundance of 1% . All mutants were KmR . As a control we mixed the wild type with CM218 , a KmR strain derived from the wild type . Results are percent of total colonies that are KmR ( % mutants ) .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14712 . 004 Growth rates and yields of the BtaR1- mutant and the parent in pure culture were similar with a small but reproducible difference during late logarithmic phase where the parent showed slightly slower growth than the mutant ( Figure 1B ) . At 7 hr post-inoculation in pure liquid culture , there was a reproducible and statistically significant increase in cell number for the BtaR1- mutant; the average cell yield of the wild-type parent was 1 . 8 x 109 CFU/mL and the BtaR1- mutant was 2 . 6 x 109 CFU/mL ( p value=0 . 0041 ) ( Figure 1B , data for this figure can be found in the Figure 1—source data 1 ) . The slight difference in post-exponential growth rate coincides with the point during growth when we expect QS gene expression to be most evident , and when the BtaR1- mutant begins to take over the population ( Figure 1C ) . We attribute the slight influence on growth of the parent to the cost of BtaR1-mediated QS and QS-dependent gene expression . Previous experiments showed that BtaR1 controls aproximately 164 genes in post-exponential phase , whereas BtaR2 and BtaR3 controlled 20 and 12 , respectively ( Majerczyk et al . , 2014 ) . We suspect that the larger BtaR1 regulon may impart a larger burden on growth than either the smaller BtaR2 or BtaR3 regulons . In contrast to broth cocultures where the BtaR1- mutant had a strong fitness advantage , the BtaR1- mutant had no advantage on agar plate grown cocultures at 30°C ( Figure 1D ) or 37°C ( data not shown ) . The starting and final percent of the BtaR1- mutant after four daily plate transfers ( about 36 doublings in total ) was 1% of the total B . thailandensis population . The BtaR2- and BtaR3- mutants had no fitness disadvantage on agar plates , as was true for broth cocultures ( Figure 1D ) . Among the many growth conditions that vary between liquid- and agar-grown cocultures is a difference in cell-to-cell contact . Cell contact is minimal during growth in broth but does occur when cells are grown on a solid agar surface . This led us to ask if QS controls contact-dependent growth inhibition systems . We previously reported that QS-1 activated the contact-dependent inhibition ( CDI ) system encoded by the cdiAIB genes ( Majerczyk et al . , 2014 ) . However , CDI does not limit the outgrowth of the BtaR1- mutant during agar-grown cocultures . We next asked whether QS regulates other contact-dependent growth inhibitory factors . B . thailandensis contains five different T6SSs , at least one of which is used for interspecies competition ( T6SS-1 ) ( Schwarz et al . , 2010 ) . The T6SS-1 comprises a pathway that delivers effector proteins to neighboring cells upon direct cell contact . Some T6SS-1 effectors have been characterized and are toxic ( Russell et al . , 2014 ) . B . thailandensis is immune to the toxins because it produces cognate immunity proteins ( Russell et al . , 2014 ) . We asked if the T6SS-1 was under QS-control by querying B . thailandensis QS transcriptomics data ( Majerczyk et al . , 2014 ) for genes for the T6SS-1 apparatus or for previously identified substrates ( Russell et al . , 2012 ) . Although genes for the T6SS-1 apparatus are not QS-controlled , we observed that QS activates nine genes for T6SS-1 substrates , as well as an additional eight that are either adjacent to a substrate gene , fall within the same gene cluster , or include a putative T6SS-1 immunity gene ( Figure 2A ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14712 . 005Figure 2 . Map of QS-controlled genes for T6SS-1 substrates and solid-surface competition experiments with T6SS-1 mutants . ( A ) Genes coding for known or putative T6SS-1 substrates ( Russell et al . , 2012 ) are shaded grey and genes controlled by QS ( Majerczyk et al . , 2014 ) are outlined in red . BTH_I2698 is the tle1 toxin gene and BTH_I2699 is the tli1 immunity gene ( Russell et al . , 2013 ) . The neighboring genes , BTH_I2701 and BTH_I2702 are paralogs of tle1 and tli1 . ( B ) . Agar surface competition experiments . These experiments were started with a relative abundance of 10% target , CM316 TpR T6SS-1 immunity mutant ( △tle1△BTH_I2699-703 ) or CM218 TpR wild type ( WT ) . The inhibitor strains all carried a KmR marker; The wild type inhibitor was CM224 , The BtaR1- mutant ( △R1 ) was CM157 , the BtaR2- mutant ( △R2 ) was CM159 , and the BtaR3- mutant ( △R3 ) was CM161 . Target cell abundance after one 24 hr round of colony growth was determined by plate counting . Data are from three biological replicates . The asterisk ( * ) indicates statistical significance between the CFU/mL measured in the WT or BtaR1 culture , as determined by an unpaired t test . Data can be found in the Figure 2—source data 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14712 . 006 Ten of 15 genes in a cluster spanning BTH_I2691-BTH_I2705 were QS activated ( Figure 2A ) . Two of these 10 QS-activated genes , BTH_I2698 ( tle1 ) and BTH_I2699 ( tli1 ) , are a known T6S toxin and immunity pair that code for a lipase and immunity protein ( Russell et al . , 2013 ) . When a B . thailandensis recipient cell does not produce the Tli1 immunity protein , Tle1 acts as a T6SS-1-delivered antibacterial factor ( Russell et al . , 2013 ) . In addition to tle1 and tli1 , QS activates neighboring tle1 and tli1 paralogs ( BTH_I2701 and BTH_I2702 ) ( Figure 2A ) . To test the hypothesis that QS activates T6SS-1-mediated killing in B . thailandensis , we competed the wild type or the signal blind QS mutants against a B . thailandensis mutant lacking tle1 , tli1 , and adjacent immunity paralogs ( △tle1BTH_I2699-2703 ) . Consistent with a previous publication ( Russell et al . , 2013 ) , the wild type outcompeted the T6SS-1 effector and immunity mutant ( Figure 2B ) . We also found that the BtaR1- mutant was impaired in inhibition of the effector and immunity mutant ( Figure 2B ) . The BtaR2- and BtaR3- mutants each showed wild-type levels of inhibition ( Figure 2B ) . We propose that the T6SS-1-mediated killing defect in the BtaR1- mutant results from its inability to fully activate expression of one or more T6S toxin genes . We hypothesized that the QS-activated T6SS-1 effector and immunity proteins in wild-type bacteria restrict the proliferation of BtaR1- mutants upon cell contact in cocultures . This hypothesis was tested in LB agar competition experiments with a △clpV T6SS-1 secretion apparatus mutant ( T6SS-1- ) and a BtaR1-T6SS-1- mutant . In this experiment , the BtaR1-T6SS-1- mutant rose in frequency from about 1% to nearly 25% of the population ( Figure 3A ) . When the T6SS-1- mutants were complemented with clpV to restore the function of the T6SS-1 apparatus , a btaR1 mutation no longer conferred a coculture growth advantage ( Figure 3A ) . As predicted , in broth coculture , the BtaR1- T6SS-1- mutant showed a strong fitness advantage during growth with the T6SS-1- mutant ( Figure 3B ) . This fitness advantage was nearly identical to the fitness advantage of the BtaR1- mutant during coculture in broth with the wild-type parent ( Figure 1A ) and to a T6SS-1 complemented competition ( Figure 3B ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14712 . 007Figure 3 . The contributions of T6SS-1 in policing BtaR1- mutants . Competitions were on ( A ) LB agar plates for solid surface cocultures or in ( B ) LB broth for liquid cocultures . The T6SS-1-mutant ( △clpV ) was mixed with the TpR BtaR1- T6SS-1- mutant ES9 ( open red squares ) or the KmR T6SS-1- mutant ES18 ( open blue downward triangle ) . The clpV complemented T6SS-1- mutant △clpV-comp was mixed with the clpV complemented BtaR1- T6SS-1- mutant ES16 ( open orange circles ) . For liquid cultures , the wild type ( strain E264 ) was mixed with CM316 Tpr T6SS-1 toxin/ immunity mutant ( △tle1△BTH_I2699-703 ) ( black crosshatch ) . This served as a control to demonstrate T6SS-1-mediated killing does not occur in liquid broth cocultures . Results are the mean of at least three biological replicates . Ranges were within the size of the symbols . DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 14712 . 007 We reason that the parent , with an intact QS system , would express quorum-activated T6SS-1 toxin and immunity proteins , whereas the BtaR1- mutant should not fully induce its T6SS-1 effectors and immunity factors . As such , the BtaR1- mutant would be sensitive to cell contact-dependent growth inhibition or killing by the wild type . This can be considered a policing mechanism whereby QS-proficient cooperators hinder the success of individuals incapable of cooperation . 
 We present evidence that QS control of T6SS-1-mediated toxicity and immunity genes allows QS competent members of B . thailandensis colonies to police against BtaR1- QS mutants . During planktonic growth in broth where T6SS-1 does not function due to limited cell contact , BtaR1- mutants have a substantial fitness advantage over wild-type cells , presumably because of the cost associated with BtaR1-dependent activities . Policing of social deviants in Myxococcus xanthus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been reported previously ( Manhes and Velicer , 2011; Sandoz et al . , 2007 ) . Here we describe a novel mechanism , for limiting quorum sensing mutant growth in bacterial groups . Several functions have been ascribed to T6S . B . thailandensis T6S-mediated killing is active against Proteobacteria species other than B . thailandensis and is thought to be important for interspecies competition ( Schwarz et al . , 2010 ) . T6Ss occur in many species of Proteobacteria where they can provide an advantage over competing species ( see Russell et al . , 2014 for review ) . We note that in other organisms including , Pectobacterium atrosepticum ( Liu et al . , 2008 ) , P . aeruginosa ( Lesic et al . , 2009 ) , Aeromonas hydrophila ( Khajanchi et al . , 2009 ) , Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ( Zhang et al . , 2011 ) , Chromobacterium violaceum ( Stauff and Bassler , 2011 ) , Vibrio cholerae ( Zheng et al . , 2010 ) , Vibrio alginolyticus , ( Sheng et al . , 2012 ) , and Vibrio parahaemolyticus ( Wang et al . , 2013 ) , QS regulates genes for the T6S apparatus ( not the effector and immunity factors as we describe for B . thailandensis ) . We suspect QS regulation of the T6S apparatus might play a role in policing QS mutants during polymicrobial competitions or in other scenarios where T6S might benefit the producing cell . Furthermore , we note that other types of toxin-antitoxin systems have been reported to be under control of other non-AHL-mediated quorum sensing systems , for example the E . coli mazEF encoded toxin-antitoxin genes are controlled by a linear pentapeptide quorum sensing signal ( Kolodkin-Gal et al . , 2007 ) . Under the conditions of our experiments the BtaR1-BtaI1 QS system carries with it a metabolic cost , which is evident in broth culture competition experiments and to a lesser extent in pure broth culture grow curves . The BtaR2-BtaI2 and BtaR3-BtaI3 QS systems do not appear to carry this large cost . We describe a mechanism by which wild-type populations can mitigate the cost of BtaR1-BtaI1 gene regulation by hindering the growth of QS mutants via regulation of cell-contact-dependent toxin and immunity proteins . This is a form of microbial policing; QS-proficient bacteria are outcompeted in populations of signal blind non-cooperators in the absence of the T6S cell-contact growth inhibition system . It is interesting that BtaR1 also promotes aggregation of cells under some conditions ( Chandler et al . , 2009 ) . One can imagine that this system brings cells into close proximity where they can resist infiltration by other strains and species while at the same time protect themselves against social deviant BtaR1 mutant bacteria ( Figure 4 ) . 10 . 7554/eLife . 14712 . 008Figure 4 . A policing model where QS control of T6S contact-dependent killing ( effector and immunity proteins ) enforces cooperation . ( A ) The bacterium on the left depicts a situation where QS co-regulates a public good with the T6SS-1 effector and immunity factors . Under these conditions , QS-proficient bacteria ( cooperators , shown as white cells ) limit the proliferation of a QS mutant ( potential cheater , black cell ) in a population . ( B ) In this situation , QS no longer co-regulates public good production with the T6SS-1 killing mechanism . Without co-regulation of the killing mechanism , QS mutants ( potential cheaters , black cells ) outcompete the wild type cooperators ( white cells ) .

To generate Km-resistant mutants we transformed B . thailandensis strains JBT107 , JBT109 , JBT110 , E264 , and CM183 with pTNS2 and pUC18T-mini-Tn7T-km to generate CM157 ( △btaR1 glmS1 attn7::Km ) , CM159 ( △btaR2 glmS1 attn7::Km ) , and CM161 ( △btaR3 glmS1 attn7::Km ) .

The trimethoprim resistance cassette was removed from strain ES9 to make strain ES14 ( △clpV btaR1139::ISlacZ/PrhaBo scar ) by using pFLPe2 as previously described ( Choi et al . , 2008 ) . The clpV complementation construct pUC18T-miniTn7T-Tp-S12-BTH_I2958 ( Schwarz et al . , 2010 ) was introduced into ES14 by electrotransformation with pTNS2 as described elsewhere ( 8 ) to generate ES15 ( ES14 glmS1 attn7::PS12-clpV , Tp ) . ES16 ( ES15 glmS2 attn7::Km; TpR , KmR ) was then made by transforming ES15 with pTNS2 and pUC18T-mini-Tn7T-km . We used PCR to confirm that the antibiotic resistance markers and complementation construct were inserted at the attn7 site near glmS1 or glmS2 in all of the constructs . . For single strain growth curves bacteria were grown in 15 mL of broth in 125-mL flasks with an overnight culture as inoculum to a starting optical density at 600 nm of 0 . 05 . We sampled cultures every hour and determined cell numbers by plate counting . For competition experiments we used inocula from overnight cultures at a ratio of 99:1 as indicated . As above , the starting optical densities were 0 . 05 in a volume of 15 mL in a 125-mL flask . Abundances of each strain were determined by plate counting on selective media . Logarithmic phase cultures of each competing strain were diluted in fresh LB medium to an optical density of 0 . 2 . The diluted cultures were then mixed at a 99:1 or 9:1 ratio where indicated and 20 μl of the mixture was spotted on an agar plate or inoculated into 4 mL of broth in a 16 mm test tube . The solid surface-grown cocultures were incubated at 30°C and the liquid-grown cocultures were incubated with shaking at 37°C to minimize aggregation . At 24 hr intervals cells were harvested , counted and used to inoculate a new broth or plate . Colonies on plates were scraped from the agar surface , suspended in phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 0 ) , and subjected to water bath sonication for 10 min to disrupt aggregates . The cells in phosphate buffer were diluted to an optical density of 0 . 2 . Twenty μl of the density-adjusted cell suspension was spotted onto an agar plate for another round of competition . Bacteria grown in broth were similarly diluted and 20 μL of the density adjusted cell suspension was inoculated into a test tube with 4 mL broth . At each transfer cells of each of the competing strains were enumerated by selective plate counting .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials\xa0and\xa0methods']",['microbiology and infectious disease'],elife-14712-v1,208,4804,4596,23.096153846153847
196,"This text summarizes key points about ""Long‐distance coordination among distant neuron populations involving newborn mouse hippocampus""  and provides additional details.   Summary:   In newborns, synchronized electrical signals occur over distances far greater (~upwards)than any physical connection could allow widespread modulation throughout various structures including cerebral association zones like prefontal lobe where neurodevelopmental abnormalities underpinning autism exist therefore raise questions concerning pathological connections established prior birth while highlighting importance given observations primarily involve immature synapses formed postmigration radiations away form principal inhibitory pathways connecting remote sites widely distributed amongst diverse species spanning mammalian brainstempore specifically address issues pertaining human cognition evolution associatedwith unique aspects pf intraspecies variation seen cross humans ranging vastly above average individuals living today,. Although there exists extensive documentation outlining alterations impacting behaviour alongside perceptual functions stemming fronthalateral amygdala damage sustained predominantly upon infancy up until late adolescence however little empirical validation addressing influence exerted onto mature behaviors exhibited earlier stages encompassing childhood till young adolescents often absent hence further exploration needed especially detailed examination utilizing sophisticated techniques designed particularly fMRI combined EEG approaches will afford deeper insight toward comprehension surrounding subject matter discussed here..","When memories are stored , or mental tasks performed , different parts of the brain need to communicate with each other to process and extract information from the environment . For example , the communication between two brain areas called the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex is essential for memory and attention . However , it is still unclear how these interactions are established when the brain develops . Now , by looking at how the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex ‘work’ together in newborn mouse pups , Ahlbeck et al . hope to understand how these brain areas start to connect . In particular , the groups of neurons that kick start the development of the circuits required for information processing need to be identified . Recording the brains of the pups revealed that electrical activity in a particular sub-division of the hippocampus activated neurons in the prefrontal cortex . In fact , a specific population of neurons in this area was needed for the circuits in the prefrontal cortex to mature . In further experiments , the neurons from this population in the hippocampus were manipulated so they could be artificially activated in the brain using light . When stimulated , these neurons generated electrical activity , which was then relayed through the neurons all the way to the prefrontal cortex . There , this signal triggered local neuronal circuits . Thanks to this activation , these circuits could ‘wire’ together , and start establishing the connections necessary for mental tasks or memory in adulthood . The brain of the mouse pups used by Ahlbeck et al . was approximately in the same developmental state as the brain of human fetuses in the second or third trimester of pregnancy . These findings may therefore inform on how the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex start connecting in humans . Problems in the way brain areas interact during early development could be partly responsible for certain neurodevelopmental disorders and mental illnesses , such as schizophrenia . Understanding these processes at the cellular level may therefore be the first step towards finding potential targets for treatment .","The long-range coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks that account for cognitive performance emerges early in life . The discontinuous hippocampal theta bursts have been proposed to drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations , yet the cellular substrate of these early interactions is still unresolved . Here , we selectively target optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefrontal oscillatory entrainment . We show that despite stronger theta and ripples power in dorsal hippocampus , the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections . Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 that were transfected by in utero electroporation with high-efficiency channelrhodopsin boosts prefrontal oscillations . Our data causally elucidate the cellular origin of the long-range coupling in the developing brain . 
 In the adult rodent brain , coordinated patterns of oscillatory activity code in a frequency-specific manner for sensory and cognitive performance . For example , learning and memory critically depend on oscillations within theta frequency band ( 4–12 Hz ) that functionally couple the medial prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) and hippocampus ( HP ) ( Siapas and Wilson , 1998; Benchenane et al . , 2010; Brincat and Miller , 2015; Backus et al . , 2016; Eichenbaum , 2017; Wirt and Hyman , 2017 ) . These frequency-tuned brain states are present already during early development , long before the memory and attentional abilities have fully matured . They have been extensively characterized and categorized according to their spatial and temporal structure ( Lindemann et al . , 2016 ) . Network oscillations during development have a highly discontinuous and fragmented structure with bursts of activity alternating with ‘silent’ periods ( Hanganu et al . , 2006; Seelke and Blumberg , 2010; Shen and Colonnese , 2016; Luhmann and Khazipov , 2018 ) . The most common oscillatory pattern , spindle bursts , synchronizes large cortical and subcortical networks within theta-alpha frequency range . It is accompanied by slow delta waves as well as by faster discharges ( beta and gamma oscillations ) that account for local activation of circuits ( Brockmann et al . , 2011; Yang et al . , 2016 ) . In the absence of direct behavioral correlates , a mechanistic understanding of oscillatory rhythms in the developing brain is currently lacking . In sensory systems , spindle bursts have been proposed to act as a template facilitating the formation of cortical maps ( Dupont et al . , 2006; Hanganu et al . , 2006; Tolner et al . , 2012 ) , whereas early gamma oscillations seem to control the organization of thalamocortical topography ( Minlebaev et al . , 2011; Khazipov et al . , 2013 ) . In limbic systems dedicated to mnemonic and executive abilities , the knowledge on the relevance of early network oscillations is even sparser . Few lesion studies , yet without selectivity for specific activity patterns , suggested that prefrontal-hippocampal communication during development might be necessary for the maturation of episodic memory ( Krüger et al . , 2012 ) . Temporal associations between the firing and synaptic discharges of individual neurons and network oscillations in different frequency bands gave first insights into the cellular substrate of coordinated activity in neonates . Whereas in sensory systems , endogenous activation of sensory periphery drives entrainment of local circuitry through gap junction coupling as well as glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission ( Dupont et al . , 2006; Hanganu et al . , 2006; Minlebaev et al . , 2009 ) , in developing prefrontal-hippocampal networks , the excitatory drive from the HP has been proposed to activate a complex layer- and frequency-specific interplay in the PFC ( Brockmann et al . , 2011; Bitzenhofer and Hanganu-Opatz , 2014; Bitzenhofer et al . , 2015 ) . While most of this correlative evidence put forward the relevance of early oscillations beyond a simple epiphenomenal signature of developing networks , direct evidence for their causal contribution to circuit maturation is still missing . This is mainly due to the absence of a causal interrogation of developing networks , similarly to the investigations done in adult ones . Only recently the methodological difficulties related to area- , layer- and cell type-specific manipulations at neonatal age have been overcome ( Bitzenhofer et al . , 2017a; Bitzenhofer et al . , 2017b ) . By these means , the local neuronal interplay generating beta-gamma oscillations in the PFC has been elucidated . However , the long-range coupling causing the activation of local prefrontal circuits is still unresolved . We previously proposed that the hippocampal CA1 area drives the oscillatory entrainment of PFC at neonatal age ( Brockmann et al . , 2011 ) . Here , we developed a methodological approach to optically manipulate the neonatal HP along its septo-temporal axis . We provide causal evidence that theta frequency-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of intermediate and ventral ( i/vHP ) , but not of dorsal HP ( dHP ) elicits broad band oscillations in the PFC of neonatal mice via dense axonal projections . 
 While different organization and function of dHP vs . i/vHP of adults have been extensively characterized ( Thompson et al . , 2008; Dong et al . , 2009; Patel et al . , 2013 ) , their patterns of structural and functional maturation are still poorly understood . To fill this knowledge gap , we firstly examined the network oscillatory and firing activity of CA1 area of either dHP or i/vHP by performing extracellular recordings of the local field potential ( LFP ) and multiple unit activity ( MUA ) in neonatal [postnatal day ( P ) 8–10] non-anesthetized and urethane-anesthetized mice ( n = 153 ) . While urethane anesthesia led to an overall decrease of amplitude and power of oscillatory activity when compared to the non-anesthetized state of the same group of pups , the firing rate and timing as well as the synchrony and interactions within prefrontal-hippocampal networks were similar during both states ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1 ) . Due to the close proximity and the absence of reliable anatomical and functional borders between iHP and vHP at neonatal age , data from the two areas were pooled and referred as from i/vHP . The entire investigation was performed at the age of initiation of coupling between HP and PFC , that is , P8-10 ( Brockmann et al . , 2011 ) . Independent of the position along the dorsal-ventral axis , the CA1 area was characterized by discontinuous oscillations with main frequency in theta band ( 4–12 Hz ) and irregular low amplitude beta-gamma band components , which have been previously categorized as theta oscillations ( Brockmann et al . , 2011 ) . They were accompanied by prominent sharp-waves ( SPWs ) reversing across the pyramidal layer ( str . pyr . ) and by strong MUA discharge ( Figure 1A and E ) . While the general patterns of activity were similar in dHP and i/vHP , their properties significantly differed between the sub-divisions . The theta bursts in i/vHP had significantly higher occurrence ( i/vHP: 8 . 1 ± 0 . 2 oscillations/min , n = 103 mice vs . dHP: 5 . 2 ± 0 . 3 oscillations/min , n = 41 mice; p<0 . 001 ) , larger amplitude ( i/vHP:110 . 6 ± 5 . 6 µV vs . dHP: 92 . 9 ± 2 . 6 µV; p=0 . 015 ) , and shorter duration ( i/vHP: 3 . 5 ± 0 . 1 s vs . dHP: 4 . 3 ± 0 . 1 s , p<0 . 001 ) when compared with dHP ( Figure 1B , Figure 1—figure supplement 2A ) . Investigation of the spectral composition of theta bursts revealed significant differences within theta band with a stronger activation of dHP ( relative power: dHP: 13 . 0 ± 1 . 3 , n = 41 mice; i/vHP: 10 . 3 ± 0 . 5 , n = 103 mice; p=0 . 026 ) , whereas the faster frequency components were similar along the septo-temporal axis ( relative power: 12–30 Hz: dHP , 15 . 0 ± 1 . 6 , n = 41 mice; i/vHP , 13 . 2 ± 0 . 7 n = 103 mice , p=0 . 22; 30–100 Hz: dHP , 6 . 3 ± 0 . 6 , n = 41 mice; i/vHP: 5 . 2 ± 0 . 3 , n = 103 mice; p=0 . 073 ) ( Figure 1C , Figure 1—figure supplement 2B ) . Differences along the septo-temporal axis were detected both in hippocampal spiking and population events SPWs . Overall , pyramidal neurons in i/vHP fired at higher rates ( 0 . 45 ± 0 . 01 Hz , n = 557 units from 103 mice ) than in the dHP ( 0 . 35 ± 0 . 02 Hz , n = 158 units from 41 mice; p=0 . 025 ) ( Figure 1D ) . SPW in neonatal HP were more prominent in the dHP ( 712 . 8 ± 31 . 5 µV , n = 41 mice ) when compared with those occurring in the i/vHP ( 223 . 8 ± 6 . 3 µV , n = 103 mice , p<0 . 001 ) , yet their occurrence increased along the septo-temporal axis ( dHP: 6 . 6 ± 0 . 5 , n = 41 mice; i/vHP: 8 . 6 ± 0 . 2 , n = 103 mice , p<0 . 001 ) ( Figure 1E and F , Figure 1—figure supplement 2D . In line with our previous results ( Brockmann et al . , 2011 ) , SPWs were accompanied by prominent firing centered around the SPW peak ( dHP , 232 units; i/vHP , 670 units ) that were phase-locked to hippocampal ripples ( Figure 1—figure supplement 2C ) . The power of ripples decreased along the septo-temporal axis ( relative power: dHP , 24 . 4 ± 3 . 3 , n = 41 mice; i/vHP , 6 . 1 ± 0 . 60 , n = 103 mice , p<0 . 001 ) ( Figure 1G , H ) . Similarly , the ripple-related spiking was stronger in dHP when compared with i/vHP ( peak firing: dHP: 1 . 13 ± 0 . 09 Hz , n = 232 units; i/vHP 0 . 84 ± 0 . 03 , n = 670 , p<0 . 001 ) ( Figure 1I and J ) . These data show that the activity patterns in the dorsal and intermediate/ventral CA1 area differ in their properties and spectral structure . The different properties of network and neuronal activity in dHP vs . i/vHP led us to question their outcome for the long-range coupling in the developing brain . Past studies identified tight interactions between HP and PFC , which emerge already at neonatal age ( Brockmann et al . , 2011; Hartung et al . , 2016 ) and are in support of memory at adulthood ( Krüger et al . , 2012; Spellman et al . , 2015; Place et al . , 2016 ) . The discontinuous theta oscillations in HP have been proposed to drive the activation of local circuits in the PFC . To assess the coupling of dHP and i/vHP with PFC , we recorded simultaneously LFP and MUA in the corresponding hippocampal CA1 area and the prelimbic subdivision ( PL ) of the PFC of P8-10 mice . The entire investigation focused on PL , since in adults it is the prefrontal subdivision with the most dense innervation from HP ( Jay and Witter , 1991; Vertes et al . , 2007 ) . In a first step , we examined the temporal correspondence of discontinuous oscillations recorded simultaneously in the PL and dHP , as well as in the PL and i/vHP . We previously characterized the network activity in the PL and showed that spindle-shaped oscillations switching between theta ( 4–12 Hz ) and beta-gamma ( 12–40 Hz ) frequency components alternate with periods of silence ( Brockmann et al . , 2011; Cichon et al . , 2014; Bitzenhofer et al . , 2015 ) . The majority of prelimbic and hippocampal oscillations co-occurred within a narrow time window ( Figure 2A ) . The temporal synchrony between prelimbic and hippocampal oscillations was assessed by performing spectral coherence analysis ( Figure 2B ) . The results revealed a stronger coupling for PL-i/vHP ( 4–12 Hz: 0 . 17 ± 0 . 0069; 12–30 Hz: 0 . 31 ± 0 . 011; 30–100 Hz: 0 . 11 ± 0 . 0069 , n = 103 mice ) when compared with PL-dHP ( 4–12 Hz: 0 . 12 ± 0 . 0081; 12–30 Hz: 0 . 18 ± 0 . 0094; 30–100 Hz: 0 . 084 ± 0 . 004 , n = 41 mice ) . In line with previous investigations , this level of coherence is a genuine feature of investigated neonatal networks and not the result of non-specific and conduction synchrony , since we considered only the imaginary component of the coherence spectrum , which excludes zero time-lag synchronization ( Nolte et al . , 2004 ) . Due to the symmetric interdependence of coherence , it does not offer reliable insights into the information flow between two brain areas . Therefore , in a second step , we estimated the strength of directed interactions between PL and HP by calculating the generalized partial directed coherence ( gPDC ) ( Baccala et al . , 2007; Rodrigues and Baccala , 2016 ) ( Figure 2C ) . The method bases on the notion of Granger causality ( Granger , 1980 ) and avoids distorted connectivity results due to different scaling of data in HP and PL ( Baccala et al . , 2007; Taxidis et al . , 2010 ) . Independent of the position along the septo-temporal axis , the information flow in theta or beta frequency band from either dorsal or intermediate/ventral HP to PL was significantly stronger than in the opposite direction . However , mean gPDC values for i/vHP → PL were significantly ( p<0 . 001 ) higher ( 0 . 069 ± 0 . 003 , n = 103 mice ) when compared with those for dHP → PL ( 0 . 053 ± 0 . 003 , n = 41 mice ) . Cross-correlation analysis confirmed these results ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . The stronger information flow from i/vHP to PL was confined to theta frequency range and was not detected for 12–30 Hz frequencies ( i/vHP → PL: 0 . 048 ± 0 . 001; dHP → PL: 0 . 043 ± 0 . 002 , p=0 . 16 ) . Correspondingly , the firing of individual prelimbic neurons was precisely timed by the phase of oscillations in i/vHP but not dHP ( Figure 2D ) . Almost 20% of clustered units ( 52 out of 310 units ) were locked to theta phase in i/vHP , whereas only 6 . 5% of units ( 3 out of 46 units ) were timed by dHP . The low number of locked cells in dHP precluded the comparison of coupling strength between the two hippocampal sub-divisions . These results indicate that the distinct activity patterns in dHP and i/vHP at neonatal age have different outcomes in their coupling with the PL . Despite higher power , theta oscillations in dHP do not substantially account for prelimbic activity . In contrast , i/vHP seems to drive neuronal firing and network entrainment in the PL . Since SPWs and ripples in dHP significantly differ from those in i/vHP , they might have a distinct impact on the developing PFC . While abundant literature documented the contribution of SPWs-spindles complex to memory-relevant processing in downstream targets , such as PFC ( Colgin , 2011; Buzsáki , 2015; Colgin , 2016 ) , it is unknown how these complexes affect the development of cortical activation . Simultaneous recordings from neonatal CA1 area either in dHP or i/vHP and PL showed that already at neonatal age , prefrontal oscillations are generated shortly ( ~100 ms ) after hippocampal SPWs-ripples . This prelimbic activation is significantly stronger when induced by SPWs-ripples emerging in i/vHP than in dHP as reflected by the significantly higher power of oscillatory activity in theta ( PL for dHP: 186 . 9 ± 12 . 5 µV2; PL for i/vHP: 249 . 5 ± 14 . 5 µV2 , p=0 . 0088 ) , beta ( PL for dHP: 34 . 3 ± 3 . 3 µV2; PL for i/vHP: 48 . 1 ± 2 . 8 µV2 , p=0 . 0049 ) , and gamma ( PL for dHP: 11 . 3 ± 0 . 9 µV2; PL for i/vHP: 17 . 4 ± 1 . 2 µV2 , p=0 . 0026 ) frequency band ( Figure 3A ) . The SPWs-ripple-induced oscillatory activity in the PL of neonatal mice was accompanied by augmentation of firing rates . While the induced firing in i/vHP peaked ( ≈90 ms ) after SPWs-ripples and remained significantly ( p<0 . 001 ) elevated for several seconds , a less prominent peak was observed following SPW-ripples in dHP ( Figure 3B and C ) . The phase-locking of prelimbic units was similar before and after SPWs ( Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . These data reveal that SPWs-ripples from intermediate/ventral but less from the dorsal part of hippocampal CA1 correlate with pronounced neuronal firing and local entrainment in the PL of neonatal mice . To identify the anatomical substrate of different coupling strength between i/vHP - PL and dHP - PL , we monitored the projections that originate from the CA1 area in both hippocampal subdivisions and target the PFC . The direct unilateral projections from hippocampal CA1 area to PL have been extensively investigated in adult brain ( Swanson , 1981; Jay and Witter , 1991; Vertes et al . , 2007 ) and are present already at neonatal age ( Brockmann et al . , 2011; Hartung et al . , 2016 ) . We tested for sub-division-specific differences by using retrograde and anterograde tracing . First , we injected unilaterally small amounts of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold ( FG ) into the PL of P7 mice ( n = 8 mice ) . Three days after FG injections , labeled cells were found in str . pyr . of CA1 in both dHP and i/vHP ( Figure 4A ) . However , their density was significantly different ( p<0 . 001 ) ; whereas in dHP very few cells were retrogradely labeled ( 0 . 15*103 ± 0 . 074*103 cells/mm2 ) , a large proportion of pyramidal-shaped cells in the CA1 area of i/vHP projects to PL ( 3 . 29*103 ± 0 . 19*103 cells/mm2 ) . Second , the preferential innervation of PL by pyramidal neurons from CA1 area of i/vHP was confirmed by anterograde staining with BDA ( n = 9 mice ) . Small amounts of BDA were injected into the CA1 area of i/vHP ( Figure 4B ) . They led to labeling of the soma and arborized dendritic tree of pyramidal neurons in str . pyr . with the characteristic orientation of axons . In 7 out of 9 mice anterogradely-labeled axons were found in the PL , preferentially within its deep layers V and VI . Thus , the dense axonal projections from CA1 area of i/vHP might represent the substrate of HP-induced oscillatory entrainment of prelimbic circuits . The tight coupling by synchrony and the directed information flow from hippocampal CA1 area to PL via direct axonal projections suggest that the HP acts already at neonatal age as a drive for prelimbic activation . Moreover , the differences identified between the dHP – PL and i/vHP – PL communication argue for prominent augmentation of driving force along the septo-temporal hippocampal axis . To causally confirm these correlative evidences , we selectively activated by light the pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of either dHP or i/vHP that had been transfected with a highly efficient fast-kinetics double mutant ChR2E123T/T159C ( ET/TC ) ( Berndt et al . , 2011 ) and the red fluorescent protein tDimer2 by in utero electroporation ( IUE ) ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A ) . This method enables stable area and cell type-specific transfection of neurons already prenatally without the need of cell-type specific promotors of a sufficiently small size ( Baumgart and Grebe , 2015; Szczurkowska et al . , 2016 ) . To target neurons along the septo-temporal axis , distinct transfection protocols were used . When the IUE was performed with two paddles placed 25° leftward angle from the midline and a 0° angle downward from anterior to posterior , tDimer-positive neurons were mainly found in the CA1 area of the dHP , as revealed by the analysis of consecutive coronal sections from IUE-transfected P8-10 mice . Targeting of i/vHP succeeded only when three paddles were used , with both positive poles located at 90° leftward angle from the midline and the third negative pole at 0° angle downward from anterior to posterior ( Figure 5A , S2B ) . Staining with NeuN showed that a substantial proportion of neurons in str . pyr . of CA1 area ( dHP: 18 . 3 ± 1 . 0%; n = 36 slices from 13 mice; i/vHP: 14 . 5 ± 1 . 5% , n = 12 slices from 11 mice ) were transfected by IUE . The shape of tDimer2-positive neurons , the orientation of primary dendrites , and the absence of positive staining for GABA confirmed that the light-sensitive protein ChR2 ( ET/TC ) was integrated exclusively into cell lineages of pyramidal neurons ( Figure 5A ) . Omission of ChR2 ( ET/TC ) from the expression construct ( i . e . opsin-free ) yielded similar expression rates and distribution of tDimer2-positive neurons ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1C ) . To exclude non-specific effects of transfection procedure by IUE on the overall development of mice , we assessed the developmental milestones and reflexes of electroporated opsin-expressing and opsin-free mice ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1D ) . While IUE caused significant reduction of litter size ( non-electroporated 6 . 5 ± 0 . 7 pups/litter , electroporated: 4 . 5 ± 0 . 5 pups/litter , p=0 . 017 ) , all investigated pups had similar body length , tail length , and weight during early postnatal period . Vibrissa placing , surface righting and cliff aversion reflexes were also not affected by IUE or transfection of neurons with opsins . These data indicate that the overall somatic development during embryonic and postnatal stage of ChR2 ( ET/TC ) -transfected mice is unaltered . We first assessed the efficiency of light stimulation in evoking action potentials in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vivo . Blue light pulses ( 473 nm , 20–40 mW/mm2 ) at different frequencies ( 4 , 8 , 16 Hz ) led shortly ( <10 ms ) after the stimulus to precisely timed firing of transfected neurons in both dHP and i/vHP . Our previous experimental data and modeling work showed that the used light power did not cause local tissue heating that might interfere with neuronal spiking ( Stujenske et al . , 2015; Bitzenhofer et al . , 2017b ) . For both hippocampal sub-divisions the efficiency of firing similarly decreased with augmenting frequency ( Figure 5B ) . For stimulation frequencies >16 Hz , the firing lost the precise timing by light , most likely due to the immaturity of neurons and their projections . To decide whether activation of HP boosts the entrainment of prelimbic circuits , we simultaneously performed multi-site recordings of LFP and MUA in PL and HP during pulsed light stimulation of CA1 area of dHP ( n = 22 mice ) or i/vHP ( n = 9 mice ) ( Figure 5C ) . The firing in i/vHP timed by light at 8 Hz , but not at 4 Hz or 16 Hz , caused significant ( theta: p=0 . 039 , beta: p=0 . 030 , gamma: p=0 . 0036 ) augmentation of oscillatory activity in all frequency bands as reflected by the higher power in the PL during the stimulation when compared with the time window before the train of pulses ( Figure 5D , Table 1 ) . In contrast , stimulation by light of dHP left the prelimbic activity unaffected . In opsin-free animals , stimulation of dHP and i/vHP led to no significant changes in the oscillatory activity ( Figure 5—figure supplement 2A , Table 1 ) . Rhythmic firing of prelimbic neurons was not detected after light activation of hippocampal subdivisions , most likely because hippocampal axons were rather sparse . To confirm the driving role of i/vHP for the generation of oscillatory activity in PL , we selectively transfected Dlx5/6 positive interneurons with either ChETA or archaerhodopsin ( ArchT ) . Blue light stimulation ( 473 nm ) confined to i/vHP of Dlx5/6–ChETA mice ( n = 19 ) led to a significant reduction of hippocampal power in all frequency bands ( theta: p=0 . 024 , beta: p=0 . 018 , gamma: p=0 . 044 ) . Correspondingly , the oscillatory activity in PL diminished ( theta: p=0 . 027 , beta: p=0 . 077 , gamma: p=0 . 019 ) ( Figure 6A , B ) . Silencing of interneurons in Dlx5/6-ArchT mice ( n = 13 ) by yellow light ( 600 nm ) had an opposite effect and caused augmentation of oscillatory activity both within i/vHP ( theta: p<0 . 001 , beta: p=0 . 0012 , gamma: p<0 . 001 ) and PL ( theta: p<0 . 001 , beta: p<0 . 001 , gamma: p<0 . 001 ) ( Figure 6A , C ) . Taken together , these data reveal the critical role of hippocampal activity for the oscillatory entrainment of PL and identify pyramidal neurons in CA1 area of of i/vHP but not dHP as drivers for the broad activation of local prelimbic circuits . 
 The abundant literature dedicated to the adult hippocampus mainly deals with a single cortical module ( Amaral et al . , 2007 ) . However , an increasing number of studies in recent years revealed distinct organization , processing mechanisms and behavioral relevance for dHP vs . i/vHP ( Fanselow and Dong , 2010; Bannerman et al . , 2014; Strange et al . , 2014 ) . For example , the dHP , which receives dense projections from the entorhinal cortex ( Witter and Amaral , 2004 ) , is mainly involved in spatial navigation ( O'Keefe and Nadel , 1978; Moser et al . , 1995; Moser et al . , 1998 ) . In contrast , the ventral part receives strong cholinergic and dopaminergic innervation ( Witter et al . , 1989; Pitkänen et al . , 2000 ) and contributes to processing of non-spatial information ( Bannerman et al . , 2003; Bast et al . , 2009 ) . Correspondingly , the network and neuronal activity changes along the septo-temporal axis . The power of the most prominent activity pattern in the adult HP , the theta oscillations , as well as the theta timing of the neuronal firing was found to be substantially reduced in the i/vHP when compared with dHP ( Royer et al . , 2010 ) . By these means , the precise spatial representation deteriorates along the septo-temporal axis , since theta activity is directly linked to place cell representation ( O'Keefe and Recce , 1993; Geisler et al . , 2007 ) . In contrast , SPWs are more frequent and ripples have higher amplitude and frequency in the ventral HP than in the dHP ( Patel et al . , 2013 ) . Our data uncovered that some of these differences in the activity patterns along the septo-temporal axis emerge already during early neonatal development . Similar to findings from adult rodents , the power of theta bursts at neonatal age was higher in dHP than in i/vHP . The amplitude of SPWs and the power of ripples decreased along the septo-temporal axis . These findings give insights into the mechanisms underlying the early generation of activity patterns . It has been proposed that the differences in theta dynamics along the septo-temporal axis result from distinct innervation , on the one hand , and from specific intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons , on the other hand . Cholinergic projections of different origin in the dHP and i/vHP ( Stewart and Fox , 1990; Amaral et al . , 2007 ) as well as maturational differences in the intrinsic resonant properties of hippocampal neurons and notable gradients of parvalbumin immunoreactivity along the septo-temporal axis ( Honeycutt et al . , 2016 ) may contribute to the observed differences . Quantification along the septo-temporal axis revealed that , similar to adults , the occurrence of SPWs was higher in the i/vHP and their amplitude was larger in the neonatal dHP ( Patel et al . , 2013 ) . It is still an issue of debate when exactly ripples emerge in the developing hippocampus , although it is obvious that they appear later than theta bursts and SPWs , most likely towards the end of the first and during second postnatal week ( Buhl and Buzsáki , 2005; Brockmann et al . , 2011 ) . Their underlying mechanisms at neonatal age remain also largely unknown and need to be related to age-dependent changes in gap junctional coupling and GABA switch ( Ben-Ari et al . , 1989; Zhang et al . , 1990; Yuste et al . , 1995 ) . The organization of SPWs and ripples is of particular relevance when considering their impact on the early activity of PFC . Already at neonatal age , the prelimbic firing and oscillatory entrainment is timed by SPWs-ripples . Of note , the degree of timing varies along the septo-temporal axis and is much higher for the i/vHP . At adult age the communication between PFC and HP has been investigated in relationship with memory tasks both under physiological and disease-related conditions ( Sirota et al . , 2008; Adhikari et al . , 2010; Sigurdsson et al . , 2010; Eichenbaum , 2017 ) . Depending on the phase of memory processing , the prefrontal-hippocampal coupling via oscillatory synchrony has been found to be either unidirectional from the HP to PFC or bidirectional ( Siapas et al . , 2005; Hallock et al . , 2016; Place et al . , 2016 ) . Both theta and gamma network oscillations contribute to the functional long-range coupling . The model of prefrontal-hippocampal communication has been initially built based on experimental evidence correlating the temporal organization of neuronal and network activity in the two brain areas . The time delay between spike trains and oscillatory phase or between oscillations enabled to propose that the information flows in one direction or the other via mono- or polysynaptic axonal projections . More recently , a direct causal assessment of the coupling became possible through optogenetic interrogation of neural circuits . In a seminal study , Spellman and colleagues used light-driven inhibition of axonal terminals for dissecting the directionality of interactions between PFC and HP during different phases of memory retrieval ( Spellman et al . , 2015 ) . We previously showed that at neonatal age , long before full maturation of memory and attentional abilities , discontinuous theta bursts in i/vHP are temporally correlated to the network oscillations in the PFC and time the prefrontal firing ( Brockmann et al . , 2011; Hartung et al . , 2016 ) . Moreover , the temporal delay of 10–20 ms between prefrontal and hippocampal spike trains as well as the estimated directionality of information flow between the two areas suggested that hippocampal theta drives the oscillatory entrainment of the local circuits in the PFC . The present data directly prove this hypothesis , taking advantage of the recently developed protocol for optogenetic manipulation of neuronal networks at neonatal age ( Bitzenhofer et al . , 2017a , 2017b ) . We observed that prelimbic circuits were effectively entrained when the stimulation of paramidal neurons in i/vHP occurred at 8 Hz but not at 4 Hz or 16 Hz . Such frequency-specific effect might result from intrinsic resonance properties of neurons mediated through hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated ( HCN ) channels ( Hu et al . , 2002; Stark et al . , 2013 ) . It has been previously proposed that oscillatory activity in cortical regions may be entrained due to the rhythmic theta-band output from the hippocampus ( Stark et al . , 2013; Colgin , 2016 ) . Several considerations regarding the technical challenges of optogenetic manipulation of HP along the septo-temporal axis need to be made . Besides the inherent difficulties related to the specificity of promoters for selective transfection and the targeting procedure that are ubiquitary for all developing networks and have been addressed elsewhere ( Bitzenhofer et al . , 2017a ) , confinement of light-sensitive proteins to pyramidal neurons of either dHP or i/vHP required special attention . In a previous study ( Bitzenhofer et al . , 2017b ) , we developed a selective targeting protocol of neonatal neurons that relies on the combination of CAG promoter and IUE . By these means , the expression of light-sensitive proteins in the neurons located in the neocortical layer and area of interest was sufficiently high to ensure their reliable activation . Similarly , the expression of ChR2 ( ET/TC ) in the pyramidal neurons of hippocampal CA1 area under the CAG promoter was sufficiently high to reliably cause network and neuronal activity . Taking into account that viral transduction , which usually requires 10–14 days for stable expression , is only of limited usability to investigate local network interactions during development , IUE seems to represent the method of choice for manipulating circuits at this early age . IUE enables targeting of precursor cells of neuronal and glial subpopulations , based on their distinct spatial and temporal patterns of generation in the ventricular zone ( Tabata and Nakajima , 2001; Borrell et al . , 2005; Niwa et al . , 2010; Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár , 2015 ) . IUE based on two electrode paddles enabled selective targeting of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of dHP in more than half of the pups per litter ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1 ) , but it completely failed ( 0 out of 32 mice ) to target these neurons in i/vHP . Therefore , it was necessary to use a modified IUE protocol based on three electrodes . This protocol , although more complicated and time consuming , allows reliable transfection at brain locations that are only able to be sporadically targeted by two electrodes The IUE-induced expression of light sensitive proteins enables the reliable firing of neurons in both dHP and i/vHP in response to light pulses . One intriguing question is how many pyramidal neurons in str . pyr . of CA1 area must be synchronously activated to drive the oscillatory entrainment of prelimbic circuitry . Anterograde and retrograde tracing demonstrated the density increase along the septo-temporal axis of hippocampal axons targeting the PL . Light activation/inhibition of these axonal terminals paired with monitoring of network oscillations in the PFC might offer valuable insights into the patterns of coupling sufficient for activation . Abundant literature links theta frequency coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks to cognitive performance and emotional states of adults ( Adhikari et al . , 2010; Xu and Südhof , 2013; Spellman et al . , 2015; Hallock et al . , 2016; Place et al . , 2016; Ye et al . , 2017 ) . The early emergence of directed communication between PFC and i/vHP raises the question of functional relevance of this early coupling during development and at adulthood . The maturation of cognitive abilities is a process even more protracted than sensory development and starts during second-third postnatal week ( Hanganu-Opatz , 2010; Cirelli and Tononi , 2015 ) . Some of these abilities , such as recognition memory , can be easily monitored at early age and seems to critically rely on structurally and functionally intact prefrontal-hippocampal networks ( Krüger et al . , 2012 ) . Direct assessment of the role of neonatal communication for memory performance as performed for adult circuits is impossible due to the temporal delay of the two processes . The alternative is to manipulate the activity of either PFC , HP or the connectivity between them during defined developmental time windows and monitor the juvenile and adult consequences at structural , functional and behavioral levels . The present data and optogenetic protocol represent the pre-requisite of this investigation , opening new perspectives for assessing the adult behavioral readout of long-range communication in the developing brain . One question that remains to be addressed is how the hippocampal theta drive shapes the maturation of prefrontal-hippocampal networks . Following the general rules of activity-dependent plasticity ( Hubel et al . , 1977; Huberman et al . , 2006; Xu et al . , 2011; Yasuda et al . , 2011 ) , the precisely timed excitatory inputs from the i/vHP to the PL might facilitate the wiring of local prefrontal circuitry and enable the refinement of behaviorally relevant communication scaffold between the two regions . By these means , the prefrontal activity driven by projection neurons in the HP act as a template , having a pre-adaptive function that facilitates the tuning of circuits with regard to future conditions . This instructive role of theta activity for the prefrontal circuits needs to be proven by manipulation of temporal structure of the hippocampal drive without affecting the overall level of activity . Understanding the rules that govern the early organization of large-scale networks represents the pre-requisite for identifying the structural and functional deficits related to abnormal behavior and disease .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion']",['neuroscience'],elife-33158-v1,186,6470,6284,34.784946236559136

Scientists still do not know exactly what causes asthma , but studies in Europe and North America suggest that individuals born or raised in rural areas are less likely to be affected . However , few studies have examined asthma in African countries , where urbanization is often quickly increasing . Examining the factors associated with the disease as more people move to cities may provide new clues about how asthma emerges , and how to prevent it . To this end , Mpairwe et al . conducted a study with over 1 , 670 schoolchildren in Uganda . Those born or raised in rural areas were least likely to have asthma , but the risk doubled among children from small towns , and tripled in those born or who grew up in the city . Children whose parents had a higher education and socioeconomic status had the highest asthma risk , but more work is required to understand why this is the case . The study by Mpairwe et al . is the first step towards identifying environmental and lifestyle factors associated with increased asthma risk in Africa . Further studies may help scientists to understand how beginning life in a more urban area plays a role in the development of the disease .","Data on asthma aetiology in Africa are scarce . We investigated the risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren ( 5–17 years ) in urban Uganda . We conducted a case-control study , among 555 cases and 1115 controls . Asthma was diagnosed by study clinicians . The main risk factors for asthma were tertiary education for fathers ( adjusted OR ( 95% CI ) ; 2 . 32 ( 1 . 71–3 . 16 ) ) and mothers ( 1 . 85 ( 1 . 38–2 . 48 ) ) ; area of residence at birth , with children born in a small town or in the city having an increased asthma risk compared to schoolchildren born in rural areas ( 2 . 16 ( 1 . 60–2 . 92 ) ) and ( 2 . 79 ( 1 . 79–4 . 35 ) ) , respectively; father’s and mother’s history of asthma; children’s own allergic conditions; atopy; and cooking on gas/electricity . In conclusion , asthma was associated with a strong rural-town-city risk gradient , higher parental socio-economic status and urbanicity . This work provides the basis for future studies to identify specific environmental/lifestyle factors responsible for increasing asthma risk among children in urban areas in LMICs . 
 Asthma is estimated to affect more than 235 million people globally , and is the most common non-communicable condition among children ( World Health Organisation , 2017 ) . In Africa , the prevalence of asthma appears to be increasing ( Asher et al . , 2006; Addo-Yobo et al . , 2007; van Gemert et al . , 2011; Zar et al . , 2007; Lawson et al . , 2017 ) , particularly in urban areas ( Addo-Yobo et al . , 2007; Morgan et al . , 2018 ) , but the causes of this increase are not fully understood . Moreover , asthma has various phenotypes which may have different aetiologies ( Lötvall et al . , 2011 ) . Asthma risk factors appear to vary internationally , and to differ between high-income countries ( HICs ) and low-and-middle income countries ( LMICs ) ( Douwes and Pearce , 2002 ) . There is little previously published data on asthma risk factors from Africa . The few studies reported have suggested that current residence in urban areas is associated with a higher risk of asthma than rural residence in Africa ( Botha et al . , 2019; Addo-Yobo et al . , 2001 ) and other LMICs ( Robinson et al . , 2011; Gaviola et al . , 2016 ) . The association between helminth infections and asthma has been investigated in Africa and other LMICs , but the findings have been inconsistent across studies ( Leonardi-Bee et al . , 2006; Mpairwe and Amoah , 2019 ) . Other risk factors for asthma in Africa and other LMICs , similar to those in HICs , include maternal smoking ( Ayuk et al . , 2018; Arrais et al . , 2019 ) , maternal history of asthma ( Nantanda et al . , 2013 ) , childhood atopic sensitisation ( Addo-Yobo et al . , 2001; Nyembue et al . , 2012 ) and history of allergy ( Nantanda et al . , 2013; Mehanna et al . , 2018 ) . Previous reports suggest no association between biomass fuels and asthma risk ( Thacher et al . , 2013; Oluwole et al . , 2017a ) , but increased asthma symptoms ( Oluwole et al . , 2017a; Oluwole et al . , 2017b ) . Unlike in HICs , higher parental education and socioeconomic status has been associated with asthma among children in Africa ( Addo-Yobo et al . , 2007; Nantanda et al . , 2013; Wolff et al . , 2012 ) . We undertook a case-control study among schoolchildren in an urban area in Uganda , to investigate the main risk factors for asthma and the patterns of allergic sensitisation . 
 We enrolled participants from 55 schools ( 32 primary , 23 secondary ) . Of the 6385 children initially identified from the pre-screening exercise , we were unable to contact 4550 parents/guardians in time for them to attend the parents’ meeting; most of these children were in the boarding section ( Figure 1 ) . Of the 1835 who attended the meeting , 97% provided written informed consent for their child to participate in the study . We screened 1779 participants and of these , 77 who had initially reported breathing problems either did not have an asthma diagnosis or did not have asthma symptoms in the last 12 months and were excluded . We enrolled 562 children with and 1140 without asthma , but excluded thirty-two with incomplete data ( Figure 1 ) . At enrolment , 477 asthma cases successfully performed the spirometry , and only three of these had FEV1 values less than 80% of predicted values . Participants had mean age 11 years ( range 5–17 years ) ; children with asthma were slightly older , and more likely to have parents with a tertiary education and a reported history of asthma ( Table 1 ) . Compared to children born in rural Uganda , children born in any town in Uganda or in the city had an increased risk of asthma [adjusted OR ( 95% confidence interval ( CI ) ) 2 . 16 ( 1 . 60–2 . 92 ) ] and [2 . 79 ( 1 . 79–4 . 35 ) ] , respectively . The same pattern was observed for the area where the child spent most of their early life ( 0–5 years ) ( Table 1 ) . There were no differences in reported exposure to farm animals , or to cigarette smoke during pregnancy . Children with asthma were less likely to have a BCG scar [0 . 67 ( 0 . 51–0 . 89 ) ] ( Table 1 ) , but the TST response ( induration >10 mm ) at enrolment was similar between cases ( 15 . 6% ) and controls ( 14 . 4% ) [1 . 03 ( 0 . 67–1 . 58 ) ] . There was no statistical evidence of interaction between parental education and the children’s area of residence in early life , nor interaction between age and any of the asthma risk factors . Asthma cases were more likely to report a high frequency of ‘trucks passing on the street near their home’ [2 . 28 ( 1 . 52–3 . 43 ) ]; to come from homes that used electricity/gas for indoor cooking [1 . 58 ( 1 . 16–2 . 17 ) ]; and to report having used de-worming medication more than twice in the last 12 months [2 . 18 ( 1 . 62–2 . 93 ) ] than controls ( Table 2 ) . There was weak evidence for an inverse association between asthma and infection with any helminths species [0 . 75 ( 0 . 53–1 . 07 ) ] ( Table 2 ) ; overall this was not statistically significant as shown by the fact that the confidence interval included the null value of 1 , but it was significant for T . trichiura [0 . 33 ( 0 . 13–0 . 89 ) ] ( Supplementary file 1a ) . Children with asthma were more likely to report a history of allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis , conjunctivitis , eczema and urticarial rashes ( Table 1 ) and to have these conditions currently ( Table 2 ) . The prevalence of current exposure to cigarette smoke ( in the household ) was similar among cases and controls , although only about 11% were exposed ( Table 2 ) . Children with asthma were more likely to have allergic sensitisation: SPT positive to at least one of seven whole allergen extracts [2 . 40 ( 1 . 92–3 . 00 ) ]; and elevated asIgE levels to any of three whole allergen extracts [2 . 45 ( 1 . 53–3 . 91 ) ] , and higher total IgE ( Table 3 ) . The most common allergens were dust mites and cockroach . Asthma cases were more likely to have elevated FENO levels [2 . 57 ( 2 . 01–3 . 29 ) ] ( Table 3 ) . We investigated the relative importance of area of residence at birth versus the first years of life , on the asthma risk , by looking at children who migrated between rural and urban areas during these two periods . Children born and raised in rural areas had the lowest risk ( the reference group ) ; children born and raised in urban areas had the highest risk [2 . 55 ( 1 . 80–3 . 61 ) ] , children born in the urban area who migrated and spent most of 0–5 years in rural areas still had an increased risk of asthma [2 . 11 ( 1 . 14–3 . 91 ) ] , unlike children who were born in rural areas but migrated and spent most of 0–5 years in urban areas ( Table 4 ) . We investigated the combined effects of the child’s area of residence at birth and parental history of allergic disease . Even among children with no parental history of allergic disease , compared to being born in a rural area , being born in a town [2 . 15 ( 1 . 35–3 . 44 ) ] or in the city [3 . 33 ( 1 . 61–6 . 90 ) ] was associated with an increased risk of asthma , Table 5 . Compared to the same reference group , children with a parental history of allergic disease had a higher risk of asthma that increased steadily from among children born in rural areas [2 . 78 ( 1 . 58–4 . 89 ) ] , in a town [5 . 16 ( 3 . 25–8 . 17 ) ] and in the city [5 . 54 ( 2 . 99–10 . 26 ) ] ( Table 5 ) . We also investigated the combined effects of area of residence at birth and children’s atopic status ( positive SPT to any of seven allergens ) . Taking non-atopic children born in rural areas as the reference group , we found that non-atopic children born in town had a modest increase in asthma risk [1 . 72 ( 1 . 16–2 . 55 ) ] , which increased further among city-born children [2 . 63 ( 1 . 41–4 . 91 ) ] , Table 6 . However , atopic children had a modestly increased risk of asthma even if they were born in the rural area [1 . 77 ( 1 . 02–3 . 05 ) ] , which increased substantially among atopic children born in town [4 . 61 ( 3 . 07–6 . 90 ) ] or in the city [4 . 67 ( 2 . 56–8 . 52 ) ] , Table 6 . We investigated the combined effects of parental education and urbanicity on asthma risk , by looking at the father’s education level in combination with the child’s area of residence at birth . We found that for each level of father’s education , there was an increasing risk gradient from rural-town-city; for each area of residence , increasing father’s education level was associated with increased asthma risk; the highest risk of asthma was among children born in the city whose fathers had a tertiary education [6 . 95 ( 3 . 52–13 . 71 ) ] ( Table 7 ) . The same pattern in Table 7 was seen for mother’s education and for child’s area of residence in the first five years of life . For the combined effect of atopy ( SPT positive ) and parental history of allergic disease , we found that asthma risk was more than five times among children with both atopy and a parental history of allergic disease [5 . 74 ( 4 . 07–8 . 10 ) ] ( Supplementary file 1b ) . However , children who had both parents with a history of allergic disease had an effect size similar to children who had only one parent with a history of allergic disease [2 . 49 ( 1 . 74–3 . 58 ) ] ( Supplementary file 1c ) . 
 The risk of asthma among schoolchildren in urban Uganda is strongly predicted by their area of residence in early life , particularly at birth , with the highest risk among children whose early life is spent in small towns and in the city . This risk increases further in the presence of other asthma risk factors such as parental history of allergic disease , children’s own atopy , higher measures of socio-economic status and urbanicity . Given the current rapid urbanisation in Africa and other LMICs , the prevalence of asthma is likely to increase further . This study provides the basis for future studies investigating environmental and lifestyle factors that increase asthma risk in the urban areas of LMICs . 
 We conducted an un-matched case-control study among schoolchildren , and report following STROBE guidelines ( von Elm et al . , 2014 ) . The study base was determined a priori as schoolchildren , 5–17 years old , in primary and secondary schools in Entebbe Municipality and Katabi zone in Wakiso District , Central Uganda . This was a predominantly urban ( town ) setting . All schools in the study area were invited and 96% participated . Study enrolment was between May 2015 and July 2017 . We estimated that a sample size of 2112 would have 80% power to detect odds ratio ( OR ) <0 . 5 or>1 . 5 for exposures with prevalence 10% among controls . At each school , we pre-screened by registering all children with any breathing problems . We concurrently randomly selected from the class register two children without any breathing problems , using a random number generator programme in STATA ( StataCorp , Texas , USA ) . The children delivered invitation letters to their parents; parents/guardians with telephones were invited to attend a meeting during which those interested provided written informed consent , and children aged ≥8 years provided written informed assent . Following consent and assent , we screened all participants with the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood ( ISAAC ) questionnaire ( Asher et al . , 1995 ) . Children with a history of wheezing in the last 12 months underwent a detailed medical history and examination by study clinicians , to diagnose asthma . Asthma was defined as a history of recurrent symptoms of wheezing , cough ( mostly dry , worse at night and morning ) and/or difficulty in breathing experienced in the last 12 months , with or without forced expiratory volume in the first second ( FEV1 ) <80% expected for age , sex and height for African children . Additional medical history included a prior physician diagnosis and good response to asthma medication . If the diagnosis was not straightforward , two clinicians reviewed the participant and if they disagreed , that participant was excluded in order to ensure proper case ascertainment . Children with a history of wheeze or any asthma symptoms but not in the last 12 months were excluded . Controls were defined as having no history of wheeze or any other asthma symptoms . There were no other exclusion criteria . The study was approved by the Uganda Virus Research Institute Research and Ethics Committee , and the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology . We collected data about asthma risk factors and allergic conditions identified in literature using interviewer-led questionnaires to parents and adolescents , including the ISAAC questionnaire ( Asher et al . , 1995 ) . When a parent was not available in person and the participant answering the questionnaire did not know that parent’s history of allergy , we telephoned the parent for the relevant information . We looked for the presence of a Bacillus Calmette–Guérin ( BCG ) scar since BCG vaccination has been inversely associated with asthma previously ( El-Zein et al . , 2010 ) . We tested for fractional exhaled nitric oxide ( FENO ) , using a hand-held device ( NoBreath from Bedfonf Scientific , Maidstone , United Kingdom ) , and used the manufacturer’s cut-off for children of >35 parts per billion . FENO is considered a biomarker of allergic airway inflammation ( Hoyte et al . , 2018 ) . We conducted lung function tests for asthma cases using a hand-held spirometer ( Micro 1 Diagnostic Spirometer , CareFusion , Chatham Marine , United Kingdom ) . Skin prick tests ( SPT ) and allergen-specific IgE ( asIgE ) are important measures of allergic sensitisation ( Heinzerling et al . , 2013 ) . We conducted ( SPT ) following standard procedures ( Heinzerling et al . , 2013; Mpairwe et al . , 2008 ) , and crude extracts of seven allergens ( Dermatophagoides mix of D . farinae and D . pteronyssminus , Blomia tropicalis , Blattella germanica , peanut , cat , pollen mix of weeds , mould mix of Aspergillus species; ALK Abello , Hoersholm , Denmark ) . A positive response was a wheal diameter >3 mm measured after 15 min , with a negative saline control and positive histamine . We collected blood samples which we processed to obtain plasma that we stored at −80°C . At the end of the study , we randomly selected 200 plasma aliquots from all asthma cases and 200 from all controls for measurement of asIgE to whole allergen extracts ( D . pteronyssinus , B . germanica and peanut ) , using ImmunoCAP ( Phadia , Uppsala , Sweden ) . The standard cut-off for allergic sensitisation of >0 . 35 allergen-specific kilo units per litre ( kUA/L ) was used ( Key resources table ) . Because previous studies have reported an association between asthma and helminths ( Mpairwe and Amoah , 2019 ) , we collected three fresh stool samples from each participant and tested for intestinal helminths using the Kato Katz method ( Katz et al . , 1972 ) . The findings on the association between tuberculin skin test ( TST ) and allergy/asthma have been inconsistent ( Obihara et al . , 2006; Eifan et al . , 2009 ) . We investigated this association by performing the TST using standard procedures , as we have previously described ( Nkurunungi et al . , 2012 ) . Data were double-entered using OpenClinica open source software version 3 . 1 . 4 ( OpenClinica LLC and collaborators , Waltham , MA , USA ) . Data were analysed in STATA . For continuous variables with clinically relevant cut-off points such as for SPT , asIgE , FENO and TST , we used the dichotomous variables in the analysis . Total IgE was analysed as a continuous variable . The variable for maternal or paternal history of ‘allergic disease’ combines the history of asthma , eczema , allergic rhinitis , allergic conjunctivitis and any other allergies ( Greenland et al . , 2016 ) . We conducted a complete case analysis , and did not impute missing values . The key variables adjusted for ( see below ) were age , sex , area of residence at time of birth and father’s education . Each of these variables ( except sex ) had small numbers of missing values ( the largest number was 29 for father’s education ) . We therefore created a ‘complete case’ data set , comprising the 555 cases and 1115 controls which had no missing values for these variables . This ‘complete case’ data set was used for all analyses . The odds ratio was the main outcome measure ( as is appropriate for a case-control study ) , and we also estimated the 95% CIs . We identified age and sex as a priori confounders , and all analyses were adjusted for these variables . We identified area of residence at time of birth and father’s education as potential confounders; we did not also adjust for area where the child spent most of the first five years or mother’s education , since these were strongly associated with the above two factors , and therefore would have introduced collinearity . Previous studies in this setting have found that father’s and mother’s education are significantly associated with socioeconomic status ( Aarø et al . , 2009 ) . We did not identify any factors which were likely to be on the causal pathways ( and therefore were not potential confounders and should not be adjusted for ) . We conducted initial logistic regression analyses for each exposure of interest , adjusted for age and sex , with random effects to allow for any clustering by school . We then ran the adjusted random effects logistic regression model ( i . e . adjusted for the above factors in addition to age and sex ) for each exposure of interest , and checked for collinearity by comparing the standard error of the exposure coefficient in the adjusted model and in the basic model ( Greenland et al . , 2016; Greenland and Pearce , 2015 ) . We did not find any problems of collinearity , so we reported the findings for the adjusted model for each exposure .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['epidemiology and global health', 'medicine']",elife-49496-v2,343,3628,3285,10.577259475218659

Many countries now aim to banish malaria . One obstacle to elimination is people who carry malaria parasites without showing symptoms . These asymptomatic people are unlikely to be diagnosed and treated and may contribute to further spread of malaria . One way to clear all malaria infections would be to ask everyone in a community to take antimalarial drugs at the same time , even if they do not feel ill . This tactic is most likely to work in communities that are already reducing malaria infections by other means . For example , by treating symptomatic people and using bed nets to prevent bites from malaria-infected mosquitos . Several studies have shown that mass drug administration is a promising approach to reduce malaria infections . But its success depends on enough people participating . If enough community members take antimalarial drugs , then even those who cannot participate , such as young children or pregnant women , should be less likely to get malaria . This is called the herd effect . Now , Parker et al . demonstrate that mass antimalarial drug administration reduces infections with malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum . The analysis looked at malaria infections among residents of four villages in the Kayin State of Myanmar that used mass antimalarial drug administration . People who lived in neighborhoods with high participation in mass drug administration were almost three times less likely to get malaria than people who lived in communities with low participation . Even people who did not take part benefited . The analysis suggests that mass antimalaria drug administration benefits individuals and their communities if enough people take part . To be successful , malaria elimination programs that wish to use mass drug administration should approach communities in a way that encourages high levels of participation .","The global malaria burden has decreased over the last decade and many nations are attempting elimination . Asymptomatic malaria infections are not normally diagnosed or treated , posing a major hurdle for elimination efforts . One solution to this problem is mass drug administration ( MDA ) , with success depending on adequate population participation . Here , we present a detailed spatial and temporal analysis of malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in four villages undergoing MDA in Myanmar . In this study , individuals from neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had 2 . 85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-MDA in comparison to those from high adherence neighborhoods , regardless of individual participation , suggesting a herd effect . High mosquito biting rates , living in a house with someone else with malaria , or having an asymptomatic malaria infection were also predictors of clinical episodes . Spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA , even in villages with high overall participation , may frustrate elimination efforts . 
 Mass drug administration ( MDA ) is the provision of medications to entire target populations and the approach has been used for many infectious diseases , including lymphatic filariasis , soil-transmitted helminths , onchocerciasis , schistosomiasis , and trachoma ( Keenan et al . , 2013 ) . MDA has historically been used for P . falciparum malaria ( Poirot et al . , 2013 ) and has recently been trialed in several locations in Africa ( Gitaka et al . , 2017; Mwesigwa et al . , 2018; Shekalaghe et al . , 2011 ) and Asia ( Manning et al . , 2018; Tripura et al . , 2018; Nguyen et al . , 2018; Pongvongsa et al . , 2018; Landier et al . , 2017a ) . It is being considered by several nations as a tool ( to be used in unison with other interventions ) for elimination ( World Health Organization , 2017; Zuber and Takala-Harrison , 2018 ) , and has already been implemented as an operational strategy in at least one modern setting ( Parker et al . , 2017; Landier et al . , 2018a ) . Given that drug pressure ( through provision of antimalarial drugs ) provides a survival advantage for resistant parasites , there has been some hesitance in using MDA for malaria . One historical malaria eradication campaign relied on the inclusion of sub-therapeutic levels of antimalarials distributed in table salt across large populations ( Pinotti et al . , 1955 ) . This program likely led to the emergence of parasite resistance in the same regions ( Wootton et al . , 2002 ) and this has in part led to hesitance among some institutions ( i . e . the World Health Organization and ministries of health ) to implement MDA for malaria ( World Health Organization , 2015a ) . MDA should ideally be used in settings with strong public health infrastructure , including easy access to diagnosis and treatment; an up-to-date and responsive surveillance system; and effective community engagement . Used appropriately , MDA can quickly reduce or eliminate parasite reservoirs and can act as a catalyst for subregional elimination of P . falciparum malaria ( Landier et al . , 2018a ) . While antimalarials are usually administered following diagnosis ( confirmed or presumed ) or used as a prophylactic , MDA is used because of an intended population- or community-level effect . The rationale is that the transmission potential or reproductive rate of malaria is so high that a sufficient amount of the parasite reservoir needs to be removed in order to disrupt transmission . This group-level effect is also referred to as a ‘herd effect’ ( John and Samuel , 2000; Pollard et al . , 2015 ) and the concept applies to most communicable diseases . If a sufficient amount of the population participates in MDA , transmission chains cannot be sustained and transmission will cease , ultimately leading to a reduction in malaria morbidity and mortality ( World Health Organization , 2017 ) . There is likely to be a context-specific critical threshold for MDA coverage , below which the reduction of the parasite reservoir is not sufficient to halt ongoing transmission . Some literature has suggested that at least 80% coverage and adherence of MDA in the targeted population is necessary in order for the MDA to be successful ( World Health Organization , 2015b ) . If the aim for antimalarial MDA is to interrupt transmission , the notion of a herd effect providing additional levels of population protection is plausible but has not been examined empirically ( Cotter et al . , 2013 ) . Drawing from detailed micro-epidemiological and spatial data from an MDA trial in Kayin State , Myanmar ( Figure 1 ) , we describe geographic and epidemiological patterns of clinical and subclinical P . falciparum malaria in villages undergoing MDA . We investigate associations between individual- and group-level participation in MDA ( potential direct and indirect effects , respectively ) ; subclinical infections; and clinical episodes of P . falciparum post-MDA . Such empirical research is important for providing an evidence base for further research , intervention , and policy work . 
 uPCR-detected P . falciparum infections were widespread in all villages at baseline ( Figure 2 ) . These infections were significantly reduced following MDA in all villages . The prevalence of uPCR-detected P . falciparum infections had reduced in two control villages ( villages TPN and HKT ) prior to MDA . There were statistically significant clusters of uPCR-detected P . falciparum infections in each village at baseline but subsequently no significant clusters were detected ( Figure 2 ) . Clusters of clinical P . falciparum episodes occurred in two villages ( KNH and TOT ) . The cluster in KNH occurred from M5 through M7 but included only four episodes . There were two separate clusters in village TOT . A cluster in the western portion of the village began in M12 and lasted until M18 ( with a total of 35 episodes ) . A single-house cluster occurred in the eastern portion of the village ( M15 through M18 ) with five episodes among four house members ( 2 in a 10 yo male , 1 in a 48 yo male , 1 in a 16 yo male , and 1 in a 48-year-old female ) . There were significant clusters of non-participation in the MDAs in three of the study villages ( TPN , HKT and TOT ( Appendix 1—figure 2 ) ) . The non-participation cluster in TOT made up a large portion of the western part of the village and included 115 individuals not participating in the MDA ( out of 919 total individuals in TOT ) . The non-participation clusters in HKT and TPN included 206 and 15 individuals respectively . Sporadic clinical P . falciparum episodes occurred in village TOT following MDA ( MDA was completed by M3 ) , followed by a small outbreak beginning in M12 ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . The first clinical P . falciparum episodes during this outbreak occurred among villagers who lived in the cluster of non-MDA participation ( Figure 3 ) . By M15 the clinical episodes were occurring through much of the village ( Figure 3 ) . Cumulative hazards plots of clinical P . falciparum episodes in village TOT illustrate the temporal patterns in infections according to neighborhood MDA non-adherence ( aggregated into terciles ) and individual participation in MDA ( Figure 4 ) . The proportion of individuals who had acquired a clinical P . falciparum episode began consistently increasing in M12 for those living in either mid or high MDA non-adherence neighborhoods . P . falciparum episodes among low MDA non-adherence neighborhoods began increasing approximately 1 month after the increase in high non-adherence neighborhoods but never reached the level experienced in either mid or high MDA non-adherence neighborhoods . 4 . 4% of all individuals in low MDA non-adherence neighborhoods had at least one clinical P . falciparum episode by the end of the study period , in comparison to 7 . 6% in mid and 9 . 6% in high MDA non-adherence neighborhoods ( log-rank test p-value=0 . 0485; Figure 4A ) . The increase in clinical P . falciparum episodes in M12 also coincided with an increase in HBR in village TOT ( Appendix 1—figure 3 ) . After MDA , clinical P . falciparum episodes in village TOT were most likely to occur among 5 to 14 year olds ( AOR: 3 . 41; CI: 1 . 33–8 . 77 , compared to 0 to 4 year olds ) and participants who lived in a house with someone else who had a clinical P . falciparum episode during the same month ( AOR: 3 . 43; CI: 1 . 52–7 . 72 ) , after adjusting for other covariates ( Table 1 ) . Individuals who lived in a neighborhood with a high proportion of people who did not adhere to MDA had 2 . 8 times the odds of having a clinical episode ( AOR: 2 . 85; CI: 1 . 28–6 . 37 ) compared to people who lived in neighborhoods where most people adhered to MDA ( Table 1 ) . The human biting rate was also associated with increased odds of having a clinical P . falciparum episode , with a 10% increase in odds for every one unit increase in HBR ( AOR: 1 . 09; CI: 1 . 05–1 . 13 ) . 
 The primary objective of this research was to look for a potential herd effect and at the impact of non-adherence with regard to MDA for P . falciparum malaria . There was an apparent group level effect from MDA adherence , suggesting herd protection and evident from three lines of evidence . First , clinical episodes decreased among all groups for a longer period than the prophylactic effect ( approximately 1 month ) of the administered antimalarials . This group level protective effect from MDA was also evident in the rainy season following MDA ( Figure 3 ) which corresponded to a surge in vector activity ( Appendix 1—figure 3 ) . Once the P . falciparum outbreak began ( M12 ) , there was a lag of approximately 1 month between the onset of clinical episodes in neighborhoods with mid and low MDA adherence and then occurred in neighborhoods with high MDA adherence ( Figure 4A ) . Second , neighborhoods with high MDA adherence never experienced the same levels of infection as those with mid or low MDA adherence ( Figure 4A ) . Individuals who participated in MDA but lived in a neighborhood with low adherence had the highest risk of having a clinical episode whereas those who did not participate in MDA but lived in a neighborhood with high adherence had the lowest risk of having a clinical P . falciparum episode ( Figure 4B ) . As has been described in other settings , this individual-level finding may be related to relative perceptions of risk; with potential complacency among individuals living in areas with lower levels of malaria ( Koenker et al . , 2013 ) . Third , the results from the multivariable logistic regression also suggest that living in a neighborhood with a high proportion of people who did not adhere to MDA was a significant risk factor for acquiring a clinical P . falciparum episode , after adjusting for individual MDA adherence and other important predictors of having a clinical episode ( Table 1 ) . To our knowledge , this is the first documentation of a herd effect conferred by MDA for P . falciparum malaria . The increase in clinical P . falciparum episodes post-MDA also corresponded to an increase in village HBR . HBR also peaked in one other village ( HKT ) at the same time as in village TOT ( Appendix 1—figure 3 ) , but occurred in the absence of a detectable parasite reservoir and the HBR did not persist at high levels . Evidence also suggests that the MP in TOT was not functioning well in the first year of the study ( reported in Landier et al . , 2017a ) . The combination of a persisting parasite reservoir and persistently high HBR ( from M13 – M18 ) in TOT likely explains the drastically different results between the study villages with regard to P . falciparum malaria elimination ( Figure 2 ) . A better functioning MP in TOT would likely have reduced the size of the outbreak . Clustering of uPCR-detected P . falciparum infections across houses occurred for limited periods of time only prior to MDA ( Figure 2 ) . This clustering suggests that interventions such as reactive case detection would have resulted in the detection of extra cases ( of both clinical and uPCR-detected P . falciparum ) when searching within houses and occasionally in neighboring houses , but these would have only been a small proportion of all infections within the villages ( Parker et al . , 2016 ) and would not have halted transmission . Conversely , community based early diagnosis and treatment and MDA with high participation , targeted at the village scale or larger , appear effective at reducing prevalence , incidence , and transmission of P . falciparum ( Landier et al . , 2018b ) . There are several limitations to this work . Individuals who did not participate in MDA also did not participate in blood screenings immediately after MDA ( i . e . M3 in village TOT ) . uPCR-detected infections are therefore likely to be underdiagnosed for these individuals , and it is likely that such infections clustered and overlapped with the clusters of non-adherence to MDA . While no genetic analyses were done with samples from the village , it is likely that these underdiagnosed infections , combined with the high HBR , led to a resurgence of clinical episodes . There is also evidence of a poorly functioning MP in this village , which could have led to undiagnosed clinical episodes , especially during the beginning of the study . Some infections are likely to be acquired outside of the village , leading to complex spatial patterns in infections that are mapped at the house level . Within-household clustering can be the result of within-household transmission , or shared exposure outside of the household or village among household members . Finally , these data come from a limited number of villages ( total of 4 ) , with analysis of P . falciparum episodes coming from the sole village that continued to have P . falciparum after MDA . Given that clinical P . falciparum episodes post-MDA were only possible to analyze in a single village , and that neighborhoods were not discrete and overlapped ( 100 m buffer around each house ) , a neighborhood-level effect was not included in this analysis . It is possible that the confidence intervals around the neighborhood MDA adherence variable are therefore too small and would not have been statistically significant had a neighborhood effect been included . This work would benefit from analyses with larger datasets . This work has relevance with regard to further research and practice concerning MDA . While participation is obviously crucial to success , there is unlikely to be a single adherence proportion that can be applied in all situations . In this study , the elimination efforts were successful in three out of four villages even though one of those villages ( HKT ) had a similar overall adherence to the village with P . falciparum remaining after MDA ( TOT ) . Likewise , this work points toward the need for considering spatial scale in MDA and in MDA adherence . Most current MDA trials and programs in the GMS and elsewhere consider a single village or community as the target unit . In some cases , especially when high prevalence villages are spatially clustered across a landscape , it may be necessary to target units above the village level ( i . e . groups of villages ) . 
 The study site consisted of four villages ( KNH , TPN , HKT , and TOT ) along the Myanmar-Thailand border , in Kayin ( Karen ) State , Myanmar ( Landier et al . , 2017b ) . The villages were selected based on P . falciparum malaria prevalence surveys using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR ( uPCR ) ( Imwong et al . , 2015 ) and were part of a MDA pilot study ( Landier et al . , 2017b ) . The northernmost village is approximately 105 km from the southernmost and the two closest villages , KNH and TPN are within 10 km of each other ( Figure 1 ) . The study was conducted from May 2013 through June 2015 . A full population census was completed in each of the four study villages at baseline May – June 2013 . Everyone enumerated in the census was given a unique identification code . Geographic coordinates were collected for all houses in the four study villages and a unique identification code was assigned to each house . All individuals were then linked to their respective houses . Blood surveys were conducted at baseline in each village , aiming to screen all individuals above an age of 9 months . Venous blood ( 3 mL ) was drawn from each participant , transported to a central laboratory and analyzed using a highly sensitive quantitative PCR ( uPCR ) assay with a limit of detection of 22 parasites per mL . ( Imwong et al . , 2014 ) . Infections detected through these blood screenings are hereafter referred to as uPCR-detected infections . Most ( 86% ) uPCR-detected infections were subclinical ( Landier et al . , 2017a ) and clinical infections were provided the standard treatment ( see below ) . A community-based malaria clinic ( referred to as a malaria post or MP ) was established in each village at the beginning of the project , as part of the malaria intervention . Village health workers were trained to diagnose malaria using rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs ) and to treat RDT positive infections with dose based on weight and age . The ID code of each participant who self-presented at the MP was recorded , along with RDT results , and these cases are hereafter referred to as clinical malaria episodes of either P . falciparum or P . vivax . Malaria episodes were treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA + P ) for P . falciparum and chloroquine for P . vivax . Radical cure for P . vivax was not provided because the absence of G6PD ( Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ) tests required to prevent hemolysis in G6PD individuals ( Bancone et al . , 2014; Chu et al . , 2017 ) . MDAs were conducted in two villages at the beginning of the study ( month 0 , M0 ) and extended to the two control villages beginning in month 9 ( M9 ) . Restricted randomization was used to decide which villages received early or deferred MDA . MDA consisted of 3 days of DHA + P , with a single low dose of primaquine on the third day , repeated over three months ( M0 , M1 , M2 for the first group and M9 , M10 , M11 for the control group ) . Follow-up blood surveys were conducted in each village every third month after M0 until M18 . A final full blood survey was completed in each village at M24 . Mosquitoes were collected monthly using human landing catches to estimate the human biting rate ( HBR ) . Mosquito catching teams were based at five sites ( both indoors and outdoors ) within each of the four study villages ( total of 20 catch sites ) for five consecutive nights during the study period M0 through M20 . Mosquitoes were caught using glass tubes and later identified morphologically ( Ya-Umphan et al . , 2017 ) . The locations of study villages , MPs , catch sites , and village houses are indicated in Figure 1 .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['epidemiology and global health', 'microbiology and infectious disease']",elife-41023-v1,231,3423,3192,14.818181818181818
221," Summary & Significance     This paper presents novel discoveries regarding TerNatIN, known primarily targeting adiposity. It identifies key interactions within various complexes involving mammalian ribosomal large subunit associated factors such Ascendrin I alpha(EEFIA) upon inhibition via newly developed hybrid molecules named ""terratinin"" derivatives derived initially off fungal metabolites called 'Aspergillus'-inspired hexapeptidomimetics'. Through extensive experimentation across numerous methodologies including crystallography techniques combined alongside pharmacological evaluations it became evident there exists significant overlap among distinct yet chemically disparate natrual substances acting specifically towards said targeted site located deep inside human ribosomes where peptidyl transfer RNA binds during mRNA decoding process leading ultimately downregulation metabolic pathways involved therein resulting potentially beneficial outcomes when employed clinically versus cancerous tumor tissues..    Key Findings:         Identification: Novel high affinity binders (""TerRatinn"") mimicking naturally occurring toxins but displaying improved efficacy compared parent analogs inhibiting translational machinery comprising component EFIA along side ATPases engaged throughout oncogene activation mechanisms commonly observed amongst malignant tumors thereby offering promising avenues both individually tailored therapies while also paving way forward development effective combinatorial strategies aimed combatting aggressive cancers effectively even ones resistant conventional treatments approaches alone often prove inadequate hence highlighting importance optimizing pharmaceutical interventions focused around selective interference points downstream regulatory networks governing gene transcription initiation coupled closely dynamics underlying uncontrolled rapid prolifertion characterizing malignancy progression therefore opening doors exploring alternative therapeutics modalities rooted firmly anchored principles underpinning fundamental biochemistry guiding rational designs capable tackling challenging malignancies successfully enhancing overall patient survival rates concurrently minimizing adverse systemic toxicity experienced frequently encountered amidst traditional chemotherapy regimens utilized widely today albeit demonstrably less efficacious despite substantial advancements achieved thus far","Many plants , fungi , and bacteria have evolved to produce small molecules that have powerful effects on the cells of other living organisms , and can even kill them . These naturally produced compounds are often used as starting points for developing new drugs . One such class of compounds are the cyclic peptides , which can be relatively easily produced in the laboratory and are able to penetrate cells . Some cyclic peptides have also proved to be useful for treating cancer and immune diseases , so researchers are keen to identify others that have similar effects . One promising prospect , called ternatin , is produced by several species of fungi . In high doses , ternatin can kill mammalian cells , but it was not clear how it does so . To learn more , Carelli et al . searched a chemical database for cyclic peptides related to ternatin and identified several similar compounds that were reported to kill cancer cells . Inspired by the structures of these cyclic peptides , Carelli et al . synthesized modified versions of ternatin . One of these was 500 times more potent than ternatin , which means a much lower dose of the compound is still able to kill cancer cells . Further experiments showed that ternatin blocks the production of new proteins in cells . Specifically , ternatin binds to a complex that includes a protein called elongation factor-1A ( eEF1A ) . Mutations in a particular region of eEF1A prevent ternatin from killing cells , suggesting a potential binding site for ternatin . The next challenge is to dissect the mechanism by which compounds binding to this site on eEF1A block protein synthesis and kill cells . A related challenge is to understand why certain cancer cells are hypersensitive to ternatin and other eEF1A inhibitors , while other cancer cells are relatively resistant . These questions are relevant to the development of eEF1A inhibitors as cancer treatments .","Cyclic peptide natural products have evolved to exploit diverse protein targets , many of which control essential cellular processes . Inspired by a series of cyclic peptides with partially elucidated structures , we designed synthetic variants of ternatin , a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic natural product whose molecular mode of action was unknown . The new ternatin variants are cytotoxic toward cancer cells , with up to 500-fold greater potency than ternatin itself . Using a ternatin photo-affinity probe , we identify the translation elongation factor-1A ternary complex ( eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ) as a specific target and demonstrate competitive binding by the unrelated natural products , didemnin and cytotrienin . Mutations in domain III of eEF1A prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects , implicating the adjacent hydrophobic surface as a functional hot spot for eEF1A modulation . We conclude that the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products . 
 Macrocyclic natural products are a rich source of biologically active compounds , and identification of their targets can open up new opportunities for therapeutic intervention ( Driggers et al . , 2008; Villar et al . , 2014 ) . Cyclic peptide natural products , especially those containing one or more N-methyl ( or N-alkyl ) amino acids , comprise a privileged class of macrocycles due to their modular structure , relative ease of synthesis , intrinsic cell permeability , and constrained three-dimensional architectures ( Bockus et al . , 2013; Giordanetto and Kihlberg , 2014; Hewitt et al . , 2015 ) . Examples of cyclic peptides with well characterized cellular targets include cyclosporin ( Liu et al . , 1991 ) , trapoxin and romidepsin ( Taunton et al . , 1996; Nakajima et al . , 1998 ) , and cotransin/CAM741 and decatransin ( Besemer et al . , 2005; Garrison et al . , 2005; Junne et al . , 2015 ) . These macrocyclic compounds target conserved eukaryotic proteins that play essential roles in calcium-mediated signaling ( cyclophilin/calcineurin ) , epigenetic regulation ( histone deacetylases ) , and secretory protein biogenesis ( Sec61 translocon ) , respectively . In addition to serving as drugs and potential leads for cancer and immune diseases , these cyclic peptides have proven to be useful as chemical probes , revealing new cellular roles for their target proteins , as well as mechanistic insights into the biochemical processes they orchestrate . Ternatin ( 1 , Figure 1a ) is an N-methylated cyclic heptapeptide that inhibits adipogenesis at low nanomolar concentrations ( EC50 20 nM ) and becomes cytotoxic at ten-fold higher concentrations ( Shimokawa et al . , 2008a ) . Previous work established an important role for leucine-4 , as substitution with alanine ( ternatin-4-Ala , 2 ) abolished biological activity ( Shimokawa et al . , 2008b ) . Motivating the current study , ternatin's molecular target and mechanism of action were completely unknown . While searching for cyclic peptides that , like ternatin , incorporate a β-hydroxy leucine , we found a patent application that describes partially elucidated structures of five related cyclic heptapeptides isolated from an Aspergillus fungus in Malaysia ( Blunt et al . , 2010 ) . All five compounds were reported to be cytotoxic to cancer cells in the picomolar to low nanomolar range ( IC50 0 . 1–24 nM vs HCT116 , MCF7 , and P388 cells ) . One of the more potent congeners , termed ‘A3’ , is shown in Figure 1a . Although only 4 out of 11 stereocenters in A3 were assigned , we were able to map the amino acid sequence , stereochemistry , and N-methylation pattern directly onto the structure of ternatin . The apparent structural similarity to ternatin was not mentioned in the patent application . 10 . 7554/eLife . 10222 . 003Figure 1 .

DOI: http://dx . doi . org/10 . 7554/eLife . 10222 . 005 Based on the potential similarity between A3 and ternatin structures , we hypothesized that replacement of N-Me-Ala-6 and Leu-4 in ternatin with two A3-specific residues – pipecolic acid and dehydro-homoleucine , respectively – would be sufficient to confer increased cytotoxic potency . These considerations led to the design of cyclic peptides 3 and 4 as potential ‘north/south’ hybrids of ternatin and A3 ( Figure 1a ) . Compound 3 differs from ternatin only at position 6 , whereas 4 additionally has dehydro-homoleucine at position 4 . Here , we demonstrate that ternatin and its structural variants inhibit cellular protein synthesis , with compound 4 showing the greatest potency . We further identify the elongation factor-1A ternary complex ( eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ) as a direct target of ternatin-related cyclic peptides . This family of N-methylated cyclic heptapeptides represents a new structural class of macrocyclic elongation factor-1A inhibitors . 
 In this study , we sought to identify the target of the cytotoxic natural product , ternatin , previously characterized as a potent adipogenesis inhibitor . Inspired by the partially elucidated structure and cytotoxic activity of the cyclic heptapeptide natural product A3 , we designed compounds 3 and 4 , which are up to 500-fold more potent than ternatin . Ternatins inhibit protein synthesis with potencies that correlate with their ability to block cell proliferation , and photo-ternatin 5 identified eEF1A as a plausible target . Surprisingly , photo-ternatin crosslinked to purified eEF1A only in the context of its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacylated tRNA . To our knowledge , specific binding of a small molecule to the eEF1A ternary complex has not been reported previously . Whether this binding event blocks translation elongation by a mechanism analogous to the antibiotic kirromycin , as suggested by the genetic dominance of ternatin sensitivity , is an exciting question that awaits future biochemical and structural studies . Also unexpected was our discovery that two structurally unrelated natural products , didemnin and ansatrienin , compete with 5 for binding to the eEF1A ternary complex . Combined with the recent finding that nannocystin A targets domain III of eEF1A ( Krastel et al . , 2015 ) , our study suggests that four natural products with highly diverse chemical structures have evolved independently to target a shared interaction surface near Ala399 on eEF1A . A didemnin variant , plitidepsin , is currently in advanced clinical trials for multiple myeloma and T-cell lymphoma ( PharmaMar Pipeline ) . Hence , drugging this surface on eEF1A may have clinical utility . Of the four structurally divergent natural products now identified as eEF1A inhibitors , ternatins may be particularly attractive as leads for future medicinal chemistry efforts , due to their relative structural simplicity and accessibility by total synthesis .

Mutant HCT116 cells were obtained from Dominic Hoepfner ( Krastel et al . , 2015 ) . HEK293T cells ( ATCC ) and HeLa cells ( ATCC ) were maintained in DMEM ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum , 100 units/mL penicillin , and 100 μg/mL streptomycin . All other cell lines were obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia collection and were maintained as described ( Barretina et al . , 2012 ) . All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma ( Lonza , CH ) before use and were SNP-typed to verify that their identity matched that of the originally procured sample . None of the tested lines are present in the list of cross-contaminated/misidentified cell lines ( http://iclac . org/wp-content/uploads/Cross-Contaminations-v7_2 . pdf ) . All cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere . Growing cells were briefly trypsinized and repeatedly pipetted to produce a homogenous cell suspension . 2 , 500 cells were seeded in 100 μL complete growth media per well in 96-well clear-bottom plates . After allowing cells to adhere overnight , cells were treated with 25 μL/well 5X drug stocks ( 0 . 1% DMSO final ) and incubated for 72 hr . AlamarBlue ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) was used to asses cell viability per the manufacturer’s instructions . Briefly , 12 . 5 μL alamarBlue reagent was added to each well , and plates were incubated at 37°C . Fluorescence intensity was measured hourly to determine the linear range for each assay ( Ex 545 nm , Em 590 nm , Spectra Max M5 , Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Proliferation curves were generated by first normalizing fluorescence intensity in each well to the DMSO-treated plate average . Normalized fluorescence intensity was plotted in GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad , La Jolla , CA ) , and IC50 values calculated from nonlinear regression curves . The reported IC50 values represent the average of at least three independent determinations ( ±SEM ) . Proliferation assays with the 21-cell line panel ( Figure 1c ) and EEF1A1 mutant and parental HCT116 cells ( Krastel et al . , 2015 ) were performed using an ultra-high throughput screening system ( GNF Systems , San Diego , CA ) .

Assay plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then luminescence was measured using a ViewLux uHTS Microplate Imager ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) . Reported IC50 values were calculated as described ( Barretina et al . , 2012 ) . Experiments with EEF1A1 mutant and parental HCT116 cells were conducted in the same manner as described above , except compounds were applied by 22-point two-fold dilution series ( 30 μM–0 . 1 nM ) . WT and A399V eEF1A coding sequences were inserted by Gibson assembly ( Gibson et al . 2009 ) into a pHR lentiviral vector containing an eEF1A promoter and P2A-mCherry sequence ( gift of A . Weiss , UCSF ) . Lentiviral particles were generated as described ( http://www . broadinstitute . org/rnai/public/resources/protocols ) . Briefly , HEK293T packaging cells in 6-well plates were transfected with eEF1A-P2A-mCherry expression plasmid , 2nd-generation packaging plasmid pCMV-dR8 . 91 , and envelope plasmid pMD2 . G using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent ( Mirus Bio , Madison , WI ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions .

Virus-containing media was collected after 24 and 48 hr , pooled , and used for infections without further processing . Parental and EEF1A1 A399V homozygous mutant HCT116 cells at 70% confluence in 6-cm dishes were treated with polybrene ( 8 μg/mL , AmericanBio , Natick , MA ) and virus ( 0 . 5 mL ) . After 24 hr , cells were trypsinized and passaged in complete growth media . Trypsinized cells ( 8 . 6 × 105 ) were washed with PBS , resuspended in 1 mL PBS , and treated with CFSE ( 1 mL , 5 μM in PBS , Life Technologies ) . After 5 min , FBS ( 2 mL ) was added , and cells were washed once with complete growth media . CFSE-labeled cells were plated ( 8 × 104 cells/well ) in 6-well dishes and treated with 4 or DMSO . After 72 hr , plates were centrifuged ( 500 ×g , 5 min ) , media aspirated , and cells trypsinzied . Trypsinized cells were washed with FACS buffer ( PBS –Mg/Ca + 2% FBS + 2 mM EDTA ) and resuspended in the same buffer ( 0 . 4 mL ) . Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry ( BD LSRFortessa , BD , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , with data analysis using FlowJo software ( Tree Star , Ashland , OR ) . mCherry expression gates were defined to span a ten-fold expression range with at least 500 events for each data point . HCT116 cells at 80% confluence in 12-well plates were incubated with compounds for 5 hr at 37°C . The cell culture media was replaced with methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM with the appropriate amount of compound . 35S-methionine ( PerkinElmer EasyTag , 40 μCi/well ) was added and cells were incubated for 1 hr . Subsequently , media was aspirated and cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) . For samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE/autoradiography ( Figure 2a ) , cells were lysed in buffer ( PBS , 0 . 5% Triton X-100 , Roche complete protease inhibitor cocktail , Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) and protein content was normalized by Bradford assay . Dried gels were exposed to a storage phosphor screen ( Amersham Biosciences , UK ) overnight and scanned with a Typhoon imager ( GE Life Sciences , Pittsburgh , PA ) . Bulk incorporation measurements ( Figure 2b ) were made by treating cells with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid ( TCA , 0 . 5 mL ) for 10 min . Precipitated monolayers were washed with 10% TCA ( 2 × 0 . 5 mL ) and solubilized in 0 . 2 N NaOH ( 0 . 5 mL ) . Aliquots ( 100 μL ) were diluted into liquid scintillation fluid and radioactivity was quantified by scintillation counting . HeLa cells grown to 80% confluence in 10-cm dishes were treated with DMSO or 4 ( 5 μM ) for 20 min ( Figure 2c , left panel ) , or were first treated with DMSO , 4 ( 5 μM ) , or cycloheximide ( CHX , 100 μg/mL , Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) for 15 min , followed by harringtonine ( 2 μg/mL , LKT Laboratories , St . Paul , MN ) for 20 min . Following treatment , dishes were placed on ice , media aspirated , and cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS .

Lysates were incubated for 10 min on ice , then passed through a 26-G needle 5 times . Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C . Lysates were applied to 10–50% sucrose gradients ( prepared in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT , 100 μg/mL CHX ) , followed by centrifugation at 35 , 000 rpm for 3 hr in a SW41 rotor at 4°C . Ribosome/polysome profiles were obtained by flowing the gradient top to bottom through an in-line spectrometer ( 254 nm , EM-1 Econo UV Monitor , BioRad , Hercules , CA ) . Lysates were prepared from HEK293T cells by washing a monolayer of cells once with ice-cold PBS and briefly freezing at –80°C . Lysis buffer ( 25 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7 . 3 , 100 mM KOAc , 5 mM MgOAc2 , 1 mM TCEP , 1 mM PMSF , Roche EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor ) was added , and cells were detached with a cell scraper . Crude lysates were clarified by centrifugation ( 15 min at 14 , 000 rpm ) , protein was quantified by Bradford assay , and the protein concentration was brought to 1 . 5 mg/mL with lysis buffer . Lysates were processed for photo-labeling as described below . For samples treated with RNase A , RNase A ( Roche ) was added to lysates ( 10 mg/mL final concentration ) and incubated for 20 min at RT . Photo-labeling experiments were preformed essentially as described ( MacKinnon and Taunton , 2009; MacKinnon et al . , 2007 ) . Reactions ( 100 μL ) were treated with DMSO ( 1 μL ) or competitor in DMSO as 100X stocks and incubated for 10 min at RT , then treated with photo-probe 5 and incubated for 20 min . Reactions were transferred to 96-well plates and irradiated with long-wave UV light ( λmax = 355 nm , 1000 W , 90 s ) . To each reaction ( 34 μL ) was added a click chemistry master mix ( 8 . 3 μL ) made from the following stock solutions: 1 . 7 mM TBTA in 1:4 DMSO/tBuOH [2 . 5 μL]; 5 mM TAMRA-N3 [0 . 5 μL]; 50 mM TCEP [0 . 8 μL , freshly prepared]; 10% SDS [4 . 5 μL] . Then , CuSO4 ( 0 . 8 μL , 50 mM stock ) , was added and reactions were incubated for 1 hr at RT . Reactions were quenched with 5X Laemmli sample buffer , and separated by SDS-PAGE . Gels were scanned for TAMRA fluorescence ( 532 nm excitation laser , 568 nm emission measured with LPG filter ) on a Typhoon FLA 9000 scanner ( GE Life Sciences ) . HEK293T cells were transfected overnight with Flag-eEF1A DNA ( pQCXIP-Flag-eEF1A1 , provided by Orna Elroy-Stein [Sivan et al . , 2011] ) in 6-well dishes using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions .

As you stand waiting to cross , tiny movements of your body – such as those due to breathing – cause you to sway by small amounts . To prevent you from falling over , your brain makes active corrections to your posture . These posture-correcting mechanisms oppose movements such as sway and keep you standing upright . But what happens when you want to cross the road ? To get you moving , your brain has two options . It could temporarily suppress the posture-correcting mechanisms . Or it could reconfigure them so that they work in a different way . The posture-correcting mechanisms rely upon sensory input from various sources . These include the vestibular system of the inner ear . The vestibular system tells the brain about the position and movement of the head in space and relative to gravity . Monitoring vestibular system activity as a person starts to move should thus reveal what is happening to the posture-correcting mechanisms . Tisserand et al . asked healthy volunteers to transition between standing still and walking , or to shift their weight from one foot to the other . At the same time , small non-painful electric currents were applied to the bones behind the volunteers' ears . These currents induced small changes in vestibular system activity . Sensors in the floor measured the forces the volunteers generated while standing or walking , thereby revealing how they adjusted their balance . The results showed that the brain suppresses its posture-correcting mechanisms before people start or stop moving . These findings have implications for robotics . They could make it easier to program robots to show smooth transitions into and out of movement . The findings are also relevant to movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease . One common symptom of this disorder is freezing of gait , in which patients suddenly feel as though their feet are glued to the ground . Understanding how the brain controls movement transitions may reveal how such symptoms arise .","The neural control of transition between posture and movement encompasses the regulation of reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion . Optimal feedback theory suggests that such transitions require the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another . To test this possibility , we investigated the continuity of the vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures . Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet , while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli ( EVS ) . The relationship between EVS and ground reaction forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses . Discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods were observed preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination . These results show humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states , suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies , as predicted by optimal feedback theory . 
 The initiation of movement from a stable posture is a central issue in neuroscience because of the need to overcome reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion ( von Holst and Mittelstaedt , 1950 ) . Navigating our world involves frequent transitions between posture ( e . g . quiet stance ) and movement ( e . g . locomotion ) , representing an ideal model to explore this issue . Indeed , balance correcting responses may hinder locomotor initiation and the transitions that are essential to safely navigate our environment ( Ostry and Feldman , 2003 ) . Optimal feedback control theory ( OFC ) ( Todorov and Jordan , 2002; Scott , 2004 ) , a prominent motor control theory , proposes that the brain implements the optimal means of performing a task by adjusting the appropriate feedback gains to reach the goal . Specific postural configurations and movement patterns are considered separate control policies , one of which must be disengaged ( i . e . by decreasing sensory feedback gains ) prior to the engagement of another ( i . e . by adjusting and increasing sensory feedback gains ) ( Cluff and Scott , 2016 ) . In this respect , OFC seems to diverge from other motor control theories , such as referent ( threshold ) control theory ( Asatryan and Feldman , 1965; Ostry and Feldman , 2003 ) . This latter theory suggests that a transition between postures involves a monotonic shift in the referent body orientation ( Feldman et al . , 2011; Mullick et al . , 2018 ) , transforming posture-stabilizing mechanisms into movement-inducing ones . To determine whether transition between motor states is comprised of discrete events or is a continuous process , we examined the temporal dynamics of sensory feedback gains prior to and during the transition between two motor states . Specifically , we examined the contribution of vestibular sensory signals to the control of balance during transition between quiet standing and locomotion as well as between two standing postures . The vestibular system encodes motion of the head in space , and is vital to our ability to maintain stability during both quiet standing and locomotion ( Angelaki and Cullen , 2008; Goldberg et al . , 2012 ) . Vestibular signals influence the activation of muscles engaged in the control of posture . This influence depends on the muscles’ active engagement in balance control , and the alignment of the muscles’ mechanical action with both the plane of instability and the direction of the vestibular disturbance ( Lund and Broberg , 1983; Britton et al . , 1993; Fitzpatrick et al . , 1994; Luu et al . , 2012; Mian and Day , 2014; Forbes et al . , 2016 ) . Contextually-dependent vestibular responses have been observed during both quiet standing ( Lund and Broberg , 1983; Fitzpatrick et al . , 1994; Marsden et al . , 2002; Son et al . , 2008; Luu et al . , 2012; Mian and Day , 2014; Forbes et al . , 2016 ) and locomotion , where the magnitude of vestibular-evoked muscle responses are modulated further during the phase of the gait cycle ( Orlovsky , 1972; Matsuyama and Drew , 2000; Blouin et al . , 2011; Dakin et al . , 2013; Forbes et al . , 2017 ) . The vestibular control of balance during locomotor or posture-to-posture transitions can be monitored by continuously quantifying the magnitude of vestibular-evoked balance responses over the transition . A similar approach has been used previously to monitor the time course of engagement and disengagement of the vestibular control of balance between self- and externally-driven states of balance control ( Luu et al . , 2012 ) . Here , the continuity of the vestibular influence on postural control during transitions was assessed to determine whether a discrete change in balance correcting mechanisms accompanies transitions between two motor states . We hypothesized that a discrete suspension in the vestibular control of balance would occur prior to the transition , due to the disengagement of the current control policy prior to the implementation of the next control policy , as predicted under OFC theory . 
 During the quiet standing period preceding the onset of locomotion , subjects swayed , generating low amplitude shear forces at the feet ( root-mean-square of 0 . 39 ± 0 . 3 N ) and relatively small accelerations of the head ( averaged horizontal linear acceleration <0 . 01 ± 0 . 3 m/s2 ) ( Figure 2 ) . All subjects ( n = 10 ) also exhibited significant EVS-GRF coherence across the 0–10 Hz bandwidth in both head orientations ( Figure 2 ) . On average , coherence peaked with a magnitude of 0 . 29 ± 0 . 11 and 0 . 41 ± 0 . 07 at frequencies of 2 . 1 ± 0 . 6 and 2 . 4 ± 0 . 9 Hz , for the head forward and the head left conditions respectively ( Figure 3 ) . At the end of the quiet standing period , that is immediately preceding the onset of the transition period , the forces applied to the body , the linear acceleration of the head and the angular velocity of the head all remained in the range observed during the quiet standing period ( Figure 2 ) indicating the initiation of locomotion had yet to begin . However , during this period , the EVS-GRF coherence decreased in all subjects ( n = 10 ) . Coherence fell below the 99% confidence limit for both head orientations: 0 . 435 ± 0 . 191 s prior to the onset of the transition , for a duration of 0 . 860 ± 0 . 260 s with the head facing forward ( Figure 4 ) and 0 . 259 ± 0 . 143 s before the onset of the transition when the head was turned to the left . However , unlike the head forward condition , coherence did not return once subjects began to walk with the head turned to the left ( Figure 2 and 4 ) . During the transition period , EVS-GRF coherence returned in the head forward condition ( Figures 2 and 4 ) . It peaked on average with a magnitude of 0 . 18 ± 0 . 05 at 6 . 6 ± 2 . 0 Hz across subjects ( n = 10 , Figure 3 ) . Periods of significant EVS-GRF coherence continued during locomotion ( i . e . the two first steps ) for the head forward condition , but only during the double-support phases ( shaded grey areas , Figure 2 ) . The maximum coherence measured during the first step of locomotion ( Figure 1 ) in the head forward condition was 0 . 15 ± 0 . 06 at 3 . 9 ± 1 . 9 Hz ( n = 10 , Figure 3 ) . In general , EVS-GRF coherence in the head forward condition was greater during quiet standing than during both the transition and the first step ( Figure 3 ) . Peak coherence during quiet standing was significantly greater than during the transition ( difference of ( Δ ) =0 . 17 ± 0 . 10 , t ( 9 ) = 3 . 32 , p=0 . 009 ) and the first step ( Δ = 0 . 14 ± 0 . 11 , t ( 9 ) = 3 . 12 , p=0 . 012 ) ( Table 1 ) . Peak coherence during quiet standing also occurred at a lower frequency than during the transition ( Δ = −4 . 4 ± 1 . 9 Hz , t ( 9 ) = −7 . 50 , p<0 . 001 ) and the first step ( Δ = −4 . 8 ± 1 . 9 Hz , t ( 9 ) = −2 . 98 , p=0 . 015 ) ( Figure 3 ) . No statistical difference was observed between the transition and the first step ( p=0 . 073 ) . During the locomotion period preceding locomotor termination ( i . e . the last two steps ) , all subjects ( n = 10 ) exhibited significant EVS-GRF coherence when the head was facing forward but not when the head was turned to the left ( Figure 5 ) . EVS-GRF coherence showed a peak magnitude of 0 . 14 ± 0 . 03 at 4 . 6 ± 2 . 7 Hz during locomotion for the head forward condition ( Figure 3 ) . As we observed significant coherence for every double-support phase following the transition at locomotion initiation in the head forward condition ( shaded grey areas , Figure 2 ) , we expected similar significant coherence levels in the double-support phase prior to the transition associated with the termination of locomotion . Coherence , however , was non-significant for the last double support phase prior to the transition in most subjects ( n = 8 ) , even though participants performed a complete final step , which displayed similar kinetics and kinematics to the previous steps ( shaded grey areas , Figure 5 ) . During the transition period from locomotion to quiet standing ( i . e . between the grey and red lines ) , EVS-GRF coherence increased past the 99% confidence limit ( >0 . 045 for individual subjects ) and remained significant into , and for the duration of , quiet standing ( Figure 5 ) . During the transition , on average , coherence peaked at a magnitude of 0 . 41 ± 0 . 08 and 0 . 24 ± 0 . 08 at frequencies of 3 . 3 ± 0 . 8 and 2 . 4 ± 0 . 4 Hz for the head forward and the head left conditions ( Figure 3 ) , respectively . Subjects exhibited larger EVS-GRFs coherence during quiet standing at the end of each trial and during the transition than during the last step ( refer to Figure 1 for the total duration representing the final step ) , regardless of head orientation . On average , with the head facing forward , peak coherence during the last step was significantly smaller than during the transition ( Δ = −0 . 27 ± 0 . 09 , t ( 9 ) = −9 . 22 , p<0 . 001 ) and during quiet standing ( Δ = −0 . 29 ± 0 . 1 , t ( 9 ) = −9 . 02 , p<0 . 001 ) . Similar results were observed when the head was turned to the left ( last step versus transition: Δ = −0 . 15 ± 0 . 09 , t ( 9 ) = −4 . 65 , p=0 . 001; last step versus quiet standing: Δ = −0 . 33 ± 0 . 08 , t ( 9 ) = −12 . 64 , p<0 . 001 ) . Peak coherence was not different between quiet standing and transition periods in the head forward condition ( p=0 . 857 ) , but was significantly higher during quiet standing when compared to the transition period with the head turned to the left ( Δ = 0 . 18 ± 0 . 09 , t ( 9 ) = −6 . 21 , p<0 . 001 ) ( Table 1 and Figure 3 ) . Finally , the kinematics and kinetics of the quiet standing period at the end of each trial were similar to those observed during the quiet standing period at the start of each trial ( i . e . small amplitude oscillations at low frequency ) . Similarly , significant EVS-GRF coherence persisted for the duration of the quiet standing period at the end of trials , with coherence peaking at a magnitude of 0 . 43 ± 0 . 09 at 3 . 1 ± 0 . 9 Hz with the head forward and 0 . 42 ± 0 . 07 at 2 . 0 ± 0 . 5 Hz with the head left ( Figure 3 ) . During the quiet standing period preceding the shift in postures , subjects swayed with low amplitude horizontal linear acceleration ( <0 . 02 ± 0 . 2 m/s2 ) , generating small GRF ( root-mean-square of 0 . 44 ± 0 . 4 N ) . All subjects ( n = 6 ) exhibited significant EVS-GRF coherence that peaked with a magnitude of 0 . 45 ± 0 . 21 at 3 . 6 ± 1 . 2 Hz ( Figure 6 ) . Before the onset of the posture-to-posture transition ( vertical red line , Figure 6 ) , coherence decreased in all subjects ( n = 6 ) , while the linear acceleration of the head and the angular velocity of the head both remained in the range observed during the quiet standing period . On average , coherence fell below the 99% confidence limit 0 . 336 ± 0 . 230 s before the onset of the transition and remained below significant level for 0 . 810 ± 0 . 351 s . Coherence returned during the transition , and remained significant into , and for the duration of , the new standing posture period . On average , coherence peaked at a magnitude of 0 . 53 ± 0 . 07 at 4 . 7 ± 1 . 9 Hz during the transition period ( i . e . between the red and grey vertical lines , Figure 6 ) , and at a magnitude of 0 . 51 ± 0 . 08 at 4 . 8 ± 2 . 3 Hz in the shifted posture period ( i . e . after the vertical grey line ) . Statistical analysis revealed that peak coherence measured during each of the three movement phases ( quiet standing posture , transition , standing posture with new weight distribution ) were not different from each other ( F ( 2 , 5 ) = 0 . 76 , p=0 . 56 ) . 
 In order to transition between two motor states , balance correcting responses are disrupted . Indeed , prior to the transitions tested , the vestibular influence on whole-body balance responses is suspended . The suspension of vestibular-evoked responses at movement initiation starts while subjects are still maintaining quiet upright stance , well before the transition onset ( vertical red line , Figures 2 , 4 and 6 ) . At locomotion termination , the suspension begins during the final step and ends after the transition onset ( vertical grey line , Figure 1 and 5 ) . Thus , changes in vestibulo-motor control occur before overt markers of the biomechanical transition . In addition , inhibition of ankle plantar flexor muscular activity during locomotion initiation occurs 150 ms before the first change in vertical GRF ( Herman et al . , 1973 ) , suggesting that balance correcting responses are down regulated 100 to 300 ms before the step-related modulation in muscle activity . These results partly confirm and extend previous work that reported a decrease in vestibular influence at locomotion initiation but increased vestibular influence at locomotor termination ( Bent et al . , 2002 ) . The apparent contradiction between these two studies is likely due to the near continuous approach we used , which improves upon the resolution with which vestibulo-motor responses can be observed compared to the discrete stimuli used by Bent et al . ( 2002 ) . The period of null coherence preceding the transition was robust and observed in all individual subjects ( n = 16 ) , and it provides insight into the neural control of stabilizing mechanisms that enable motion from a stable posture . From an OFC perspective , distinct neural processes govern the control of posture and movement ( Scott , 2004; Kurtzer et al . , 2005; Cluff and Scott , 2016 ) . To transition from quiet standing to movement , or another relatively stable posture , the current motor policy associated with quiet standing must be disengaged to permit the implementation of a new control policy ( Cluff and Scott , 2016 ) . In the locomotor transition task , the control policy regulating standing balance is disengaged to allow implementation of the locomotor control policy , and reversely when terminating locomotion . For the posture-to-posture transition , the motor control policy associated with standing balance is disengaged to permit the shift to a new posture . These periods of null coherence preceding transition thus illustrate when the brain disengages the current control policy . Furthermore , this vestibular disengagement solves the classic problem formulated by von Holst and Mittelstaedt regarding the opposing action from stabilizing reflexes when initiating motion ( von Holst and Mittelstaedt , 1950 ) . From a biomechanical point of view , the disengagement of vestibular influence on the whole-body postural responses may also be necessary for the transition process , and thus incorporated into motor planning . The disruption in vestibular contribution to balance during transitions appears to contradict a key prediction from referent control theory: a monotonic shift in referent body orientation during shifts in postures while standing upright ( Mullick et al . , 2018 ) . Our data show the intermittent use of vestibular feedback during transition between standing postures but it is unclear if a shift in referent body configuration is associated with such a transition . The period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses appears related to the different relative sensory feedback gains needed to control whole-body movements by the quiet standing and locomotor control policies . During quiet standing , whole-body accelerations ( and related GRF ) and oscillations within the limits of the base of support are small . An adaptive feedback controller ( Fitzpatrick et al . , 1996; van der Kooij and de Vlugt , 2007 ) to which vestibular feedback contributes , can generate the appropriate muscular torques required to maintain upright stance . When initiating movement , whole-body accelerations larger than those observed during quiet stance are needed to move the whole-body center of mass towards the base of support limits or outside the base of support . If the gain of the vestibular channel in the adaptive controller remained unchanged during the transition , the vestibular-evoked whole-body responses would increase due simply to the larger whole-body accelerations , potentially challenging the limits of postural stability or countering the intended motion of the body . Consequently , an adaptive controller would need to adjust the gain of the vestibular channel to maintain upright stability during this transition period . Based on our results , it appears that the transition in gains between the initial and the final policies is preceded by a suppression of vestibular gain . Vestibular gain is increased once again following the transition , but in a context-dependent manner . For example , in the event of a transition from quiet standing to locomotion , vestibular gain is increased during locomotion to control lateral stability , primarily ( Figure 2 ) . Similarly , it appears that the locomotor control policy is interrupted preceding locomotion termination ( i . e . during the last step ) to allow the implementation of the quiet standing control policy . Lastly , an alternative interpretation is that the brain abruptly switches policies and starts predicting the whole-body’s future state whilst the body briefly remains in the previous state . Thus , for a short period of time , there is a discrepancy between the predicted and the actual sensory feedback that might result in a reduction in the size of the vestibular-evoked responses ( Luu et al . , 2012 ) . Significant coherence between EVS and the GRF were limited primarily to the 0–10 Hz bandwidth despite using EVS up to 20 Hz . These observations are in line with previous studies that characterized vestibular-evoked responses when humans are standing and walking ( Dakin et al . , 2007 , 2010 ) . As vestibular signals cascade from the nervous system to muscle activation and from muscle activation to whole-body accelerations , the vestibular signals are low-pass filtered ( Dakin et al . , 2010 ) . Presumably , the inertia of the limb segments and whole-body impose mechanical constraints that limit the frequencies at which their motion can remain in phase with , and thus correlate with , the EVS . These low frequency responses observed in the GRF to the vestibular stimuli are thought to reflect neural processing underlying an organised balance correcting response to a craniocentric vestibular error signal ( Reynolds , 2010; Mian and Day , 2014 ) . Although the exact anatomical regions associated with the suppression of vestibular-evoked responses are unclear , putative regions that may contribute to control policy changes have been proposed . Primary motor cortex neurons responding to externally applied mechanical loads were found active only during the maintenance of postural orientation while others only during movement ( Kurtzer et al . , 2005; Herter et al . , 2009 ) . For certain cortical neurons , Kurtzer et al . ( 2005 ) observed an abrupt switch in the pattern of neural processing ~0 . 3 s before the transition from a stationary posture to a reaching movement . Our results appear to mirror this behavior and extend the framework to a balance-locomotor context . In the brainstem , selective attenuation of ‘vestibular only’ neurons might change the response of vestibular nuclei neurons during self-generated locomotor movement ( Roy and Cullen , 2001 ) . However , these neuronal responses are largely related to the predictable nature of the feedback and would therefore be ineffective at selectively suppressing an unpredictable EVS-induced perturbation signal . Although this mechanism may contribute to the attenuation of EVS-GRF responses , recent findings ( Brooks and Cullen , 2014 ) indicate that it is likely insufficient to suppress the vestibular-evoked responses observed in this study . Whole-body balance responses evoked by EVS are craniocentric and thus the direction of the error can be manipulated by actively maintaining the head in different orientations ( Materials and methods , Lund and Broberg , 1983; Dalton et al . , 2014 ) . In the frontal plane , our upright posture is normally unstable during locomotion because the whole-body centre of mass is always medial to the propulsive foot ( Winter , 1995 ) . Stability in the sagittal plane , on the other hand , is enhanced by the forward momentum of the body ( Sparrow and Tirosh , 2005 ) and the long base of support during double-support phases . This difference in stability between the frontal and the sagittal planes may explain the small ( or absent ) vestibular-evoked responses observed during locomotion when the head is turned to the left ( i . e . vestibular error directed in the anteroposterior direction ) . The reduced coherence between EVS and anteroposterior GRF further support the hypothesis that the anteroposterior control of whole-body balance during locomotion requires less feedback-driven control than in the frontal plane , and may instead be largely passively controlled . Thus , our results agree with the assumption that sagittal plane stability is passively controlled ( Bauby and Kuo , 2000 ) . We further showed that vestibular-evoked whole-body responses in the frontal plane are phasically modulated during locomotion , exhibiting larger coherence during the double-support phase ( excluding the last step at termination , Figures 2 and 5 ) . Vestibulo-muscular coherence also exhibits phasic behavior for single muscles during locomotion with the head facing forward ( Blouin et al . , 2011; Dakin et al . , 2013; Forbes et al . , 2017 ) , however it was not clear from summing coherence over several muscles whether the whole-body response is also phasically modulated ( Dakin et al . , 2013 ) . From a biomechanical point of view , the double-support phase is important for stability: the base of support is larger in the mediolateral direction compared to single-support phase , the swing foot lands and body weight is transferred from one foot to another ( Winter , 1995 ) . Not surprisingly , EVS applied during either locomotor transition or walking leads to increased upper body roll and modified lateral foot placement ( Bent et al . , 2002 ) . This could result in an inefficient mediolateral transfer of body weight and to steps placed more laterally than usual , raising energy consumption ( Kuo , 2002 ) . The disruption in the vestibular control of balance observed prior to biomechanical transition indicates that the brain first down regulates balance-correcting mechanisms to enable the transition . This disruption in the vestibular control of balance reduces counteracting effects of vestibular balance correcting responses that could prohibit movement initiation , thus supporting a prediction from current OFC models . Importantly , the suppression of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms is not specific to one type of transition , suggesting it represents a general control process that occurs during transitions between standing balance and other motor states . Thus , our results demonstrate that humans ‘stop balancing’ before they start moving and ‘stop moving’ before they start balancing again . 
 Sixteen healthy young subjects without any history of neurological nor muscular disorders participated in our experimental protocol approved by the University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Committee and conforms to the Declaration of Helsinki . The experimental protocols were explained to each subject and written consent was obtained . Among our participants , ten males [age 27 . 6 ± 4 . 6 years old , height 1 . 81 ± 0 . 04 m , weight 80 . 5 ± 9 . 6 kg ( mean ± SD ) ] performed the experiment involving locomotion initiation and termination ( locomotor transition ) and three males and three females [age 27 . 5 ± 2 . 1 years old , height 1 . 74 ± 0 . 07 m , weight 69 . 9 ± 6 . 3 kg] performed the experiment involving a change in body-weight distribution ( posture-to-posture transition ) . During trials , subjects were exposed to electrical vestibular stimulation ( EVS ) ( Dakin et al . , 2007 , 2013; Blouin et al . , 2011 ) applied to the mastoid processes behind each ear . EVS non-specifically modulates the firing rate of the nearby vestibular nerves ( Goldberg et al . , 1984; Kim and Curthoys , 2004 ) and , when delivered in a binaural bipolar electrode configuration , evokes a perception of rotation ( Fitzpatrick et al . , 2002; Peters et al . , 2015 ) about an axis directed posteriorly and superiorly 18° relative to the Reid’s plane ( Fitzpatrick and Day , 2004 ) . When the head is facing forward , the binaural bipolar electrical stimulus induces a postural response to compensate for the vestibular-induced roll error signal of the body in the frontal plane ( Lund and Broberg , 1983; Britton et al . , 1993; Day et al . , 1997; Mian and Day , 2014; Forbes et al . , 2016 , 2017 ) . Subjects were exposed to a bandwidth-limited noisy EVS ( 0–20 Hz , zero-mean low-pass filtered white noise , 20 Hz cut-off frequency , zero lag , 4-order Butterworth , peak amplitude of 4 mA , root mean square ~2 mA ) lasting 30 s ( locomotor transition ) or 15 s ( posture-to-posture transition ) , and created using LabVIEW software ( 2011 version; National Instruments , Austin , TX , USA ) ( Dakin et al . , 2007 , 2013 ) . EVS was delivered to subjects using an isolated constant current stimulation unit ( STMISOLA , Biopac Systems , Goleta , CA , USA ) connected to carbon rubber electrodes ( ~9 cm2 ) coated with conductive gel ( Spectra 360 , Parker Laboratories , Fairfield , NJ , USA ) and secured over their mastoid processes with adhesive tape and an elastic headband . During the experiment , the stimulation unit remained in a torso-pack worn by the subject . The stimulus bandwidth ( 0–20 Hz ) was chosen to characterize the entire frequency response of vestibular-induced modulation in lower limb muscle and whole-body force production ( Dakin et al . , 2007 , 2010 , 2011; Mian et al . , 2010; Reynolds , 2010 ) . The stimulus amplitude varied between ±4 mA , and was chosen to evoke measurable force responses during both standing and walking and ensure subject comfort , based on previous experience ( Dakin et al . , 2007 , 2013; Blouin et al . , 2011; Forbes et al . , 2017 ) . Across all subjects ( n = 16 ) , six were new to EVS . First , subjects stood with each foot over distinct forceplates ( FP1 and FP5 , Figure 1 ) , their arms at their side and eyes open . Subjects self-selected both the position and orientation of their feet , to ensure their comfort , but were encouraged to choose a foot width close to their pelvis width , because support width influences the magnitude of EVS-evoked responses ( Day et al . , 1997 ) . Once chosen , the position and orientation of the feet were marked on the ground , to ensure a reproducible starting position across trials . Subjects wore a head-mounted laser pointer and were instructed to maintain the projected position of this laser at a specific point on the wall , which was 4 m in front of them at the start of the trial . We determined the target for the laser by positioning participant’s head nose up from the floor , with their Frankfurt plane ( the auriculo-orbital plane ) approximately 18° up from horizontal , to maximize the EVS-evoked balance responses ( see Fitzpatrick and Day , 2004 , for a review ) . Participants were required to maintain this head orientation for the duration of the trial . The experimenter visually monitored the inclination angle of the head during the trial . To control the modulating effect of head orientation on the vestibular-induced instability during locomotor transition , participants completed trials in one of two head orientations . During this experiment , subjects repeated blocks of 105 trials with the head facing forward or turned 90° over the left shoulder ( Figure 1 ) . During the posture-to-posture experiment , subjects performed only one block of 105 trials with the head facing forward . When the head is facing forward , EVS induces a postural response along the mediolateral whole-body axis . When the head is turned 90° to the left , postural responses are directed along the anteroposterior whole-body axis ( Lund and Broberg , 1983; Fitzpatrick et al . , 1994; Forbes et al . , 2016 ) . Subjects participating in the locomotor transition experiment performed blocks of trials on separate days and we randomly assigned the order of the two blocks for each subject . During each block , the first five trials were used to collect the subject's kinetic and kinematic data in absence of EVS . These trials served as a control to determine if EVS modified the movement pattern . We provided EVS for the remaining 100 trials . Statistical analysis of the movement patterns between trials with and without EVS were performed using two-sided t-tests for each head position condition . In the locomotor transition experiment , the analysis did not reveal any major behavioral difference between these two conditions , except at locomotion termination , for a significantly decreased transition period ( Δ = −0 . 094 ± 0 . 070 s , t ( 54 ) = −4 . 93 , p<0 . 001 and Δ = −0 . 330 ± 0 . 123 s , t ( 51 ) = −7 . 49 , p<0 . 001 ) and an increased walking velocity ( Δ = 0 . 044 ± 0 . 013 m/s , t ( 50 ) = −15 . 79 , p<0 . 001 and Δ = 0 . 113 ± 0 . 070 m/s , t ( 51 ) = 73 . 82 , p<0 . 001 ) , respectively in the head forward and head left conditions . In the posture-to-posture experiment , we did not find any significant behavioral differences between the trials with and without EVS . To quantify the effect of the vestibular stimulus on subjects' behaviour , we recorded the ground reaction forces ( GRF ) applied to their body as well as linear acceleration and angular velocity of their head over the duration of each trial . The GRF were collected from eight forceplates ( squares of 60 × 60 cm , AMTI , Watertown , MA , USA ) recessed into the ground of the experimental room , covering an area of 2 . 88 m2 . GRF were digitized using a sampling rate of 1000 Hz ( PXI-8108 , National Instruments , Austin , TX , USA ) and saved offline , with the vestibular stimulus and the vibration pulse signals . We measured the linear acceleration and angular velocity of the head and waist using two inertial measurement units ( Shimmer2R w450/mAH Battery , 5 . 1 × 3 . 4 × 1 . 4 cm , Shimmer Sensing , Dublin , Ireland ) positioned on the forehead and the sacrum . The inertial measurement units were secured to the head and waist using Velcro belts . During trials , data from the inertial measurement units were sampled at 256 Hz and streamed to a personal computer for storage and future analysis . Because we used two separate computers to save the forceplate and inertial measurement units’ data , the two were synchronized in post-processing using the onset of the first vibration pulse . After identifying the biomechanical markers of the transitions phases , we analyzed the vestibular responses during the transition between standing balance and locomotion and between the two standing postures to determine if vestibular feedback is disrupted as predicted by the OFC theory . All non-statistical analyses were performed using custom-designed routines on Matlab software ( 2015a version , Mathworks , Natick , MA , USA ) . The relationship between EVS and the GRF for each experiment was estimated using time-frequency coherence based on continuous Morlet wavelet decomposition ( Zhan et al . , 2006; Blouin et al . , 2011 ) . This method has been previously used to estimate the changes in vestibular-evoked responses measured by EMG ( Blouin et al . , 2011; Luu et al . , 2012; Dakin et al . , 2013; Forbes et al . , 2014 , 2017 ) and was chosen here to avoid potential issues associated with gain estimates due to the larger GRF during locomotion ( and transitions ) than during quiet standing . We evaluated the coherence between the vestibular stimulus and the horizontal GRF because they reflect the net muscle activity of the body and are related to the horizontal accelerations of the whole-body centre of mass . Coherence [C ( τ , f ) ] used to estimate vestibulo-GRF coupling was computed using the following equation: ( 1 ) C ( τ , f ) = |Pxy ( τ , f ) |2Pxx ( τ , f ) Pyy ( τ , f ) In Equation ( 1 ) : τ is the movement time; f denotes the frequency; Pxy ( τ , f ) is the time-dependent cross-spectrum between the EVS and the shear force of interest; and Pxxτ , f and Pyy ( τ , f ) are the time-dependent auto-spectra of the EVS and the shear force of interest , which depends on head orientation . When the head faces forward , the perturbation resulting from the vestibular stimulus is directed mediolaterally , therefore the mediolateral shear forces ( FY ) were used for the analysis of the head forward condition . When the head is turned to the side , the perturbation resulting from the vestibular stimulus is in the anteroposterior direction , therefore the anteroposterior shear forces ( FX ) were used for the head left condition . Significant whole-body responses to the EVS were identified on a subject-by-subject basis when coherence exceeded a 99% confidence limit determined by the number of trials completed ( n = 100 ) . This confidence limit corresponds to a coherence magnitude threshold of 0 . 045 , and better represents an α-level of 0 . 05 because of the two-dimensional ( time and frequency ) nature of the measures ( Blouin et al . , 2011 ) . For illustrative purposes , we also computed the coherence for all subjects using the same procedure ( n = 1000 for the locomotor transition or n = 600 for the posture-to-posture transition ) . Coherence crossed the 99% confidence limit in these pooled data at a magnitude of 0 . 005 ( locomotor transition ) or 0 . 008 ( posture-to-posture transition ) . Under OFC theory , we expected a discontinuity in time-frequency coherence prior to the different transitions which should be reflective of the disengagement of either the balance , or ( loco ) motor control policies . To test this hypothesis , using the non-normalized time-scale format , we determined whether the magnitude of time-frequency coherence was significant or not ( i . e . above or below the 99% confidence interval , respectively ) over the transition period . To identify state-dependent changes in vestibular control of balance over the locomotor transition period , the magnitude of the peak time-dependent coherence and its corresponding frequency were extracted from the movement-time normalized data in each subject and for the three phases of the balance-locomotor transitions: quiet standing ( from first vibration pulse to transition onset for initiation and from end of transition to last vibration pulse for termination ) , transition ( from transition onset to first foot-off for initiation and from last foot-strike to transition end for termination ) and the first/last step ( from first foot-off to second foot-off for initiation and from second last foot-strike to last foot-strike for termination ) ( Figure 1 ) . The same procedure was repeated for the posture-to-posture transition ( but for the non-normalized time format ) for the three following steps: quiet standing ( from first vibration pulse to transition onset , i . e . vertical red line ) , transition ( from transition onset to transition end , i . e . between the two vertical lines ) and the new posture ( from transition end , i . e . the vertical grey line , to the end of the trial ) ( Figure 6 ) . Peak magnitude and/or frequency were used to determine whether coherence changed between the three phases , relative to the direction of vestibular-evoked responses . To test for significant differences across the three phases of each transition tested , we used repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) . To decompose the main effect , we used a multivariate post hoc analysis consisting of paired Hotelling’s t-square tests ( Bonferroni corrected ) . For each multivariate post hoc test providing a significant result , we tested whether the significant result was caused by differences in magnitude peak coherence , peak coherence frequency , or both by performing a Bonferroni corrected paired t-test . In the locomotor transition , this whole procedure was repeated independently for each head orientation within each transition ( initiation and termination ) . Coherence confidence limits were computed using Matlab software ( 2015a version , Mathworks , Natick , MA , USA ) . All other statistical tests were performed using R Studio software ( version 3 . 3 . 1 ) with an α level of p<0 . 05 serving as the threshold for significance .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']",['neuroscience'],elife-36123-v2,235,6923,6688,29.459574468085105

Without treatment , it is always fatal: even with proper antibiotics , about a quarter of patients do not survive and many will have permanent brain damage . Overactive inflammation is thought to contribute to this process . Corticosteroid drugs , which dampen the inflammatory process , are therefore often used during treatment . However , they merely reduce mortality by 30% , suggesting that only some people benefit from them . Two recent studies have linked the genetic makeup of individuals who have tuberculous meningitis to how they respond to corticosteroids . There were , in particular , differences in the LTA4H gene that codes for an inflammation-causing protein . According to these results , only individuals carrying high-inflammation versions of the LTA4H gene would benefit from the treatment . Yet a third study did not find any effect of the genetic background of patients . All three papers used frequentist statistics to draw their conclusions , only examining the percentage of people who survived in each group . Yet , this type of analysis can miss important details . It also does not work well when the number of patients is small , or when the effectiveness of a drug varies during the course of an illness . Another method , called Bayesian statistics , can perform better under these limitations . In particular , it takes into account the probability of an event based on prior knowledge – for instance , that the risk of dying varies smoothly with time . Here , Whitworth et al . used Bayesian statistics to reanalyse the data from these studies , demonstrating that death rates were correlated with the type of LTA4H gene carried by patients . In particular , corticosteroid treatment worked best for people with the high inflammation versions of the gene . However , regardless of genetic background , corticosteroids were not effective if patients were extremely sick before being treated . The work by Whitworth et al . demonstrates the importance of using Bayesian statistics to examine the effectiveness of medical treatments . It could help to design better protocols for tuberculous meningitis treatment , tailored to the genetic makeup of patients .","Tuberculous meningitis has high mortality , linked to excessive inflammation . However , adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids reduce mortality by only 30% , suggesting that inflammatory pathophysiology causes only a subset of deaths . In Vietnam , the survival benefit of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids was most pronounced in patients with a C/T promoter variant in the leukotriene A4 hydrolase ( LTA4H ) gene encoding an enzyme that regulates inflammatory eicosanoids . LTA4H TT patients with increased expression had increased survival , consistent with corticosteroids benefiting individuals with hyper-inflammatory responses . However , an Indonesia study did not find an LTA4H TT genotype survival benefit . Here using Bayesian methods to analyse both studies , we find that LTA4H TT genotype confers survival benefit that begins early and continues long-term in both populations . This benefit is nullified in the most severe cases with high early mortality . LTA4H genotyping together with disease severity assessment may target glucocorticoid therapy to patients most likely to benefit from it . 
 Tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) is the most severe form of tuberculosis . Despite effective antimicrobial therapy , it results in 20–25% mortality in HIV-negative individuals and ~40% mortality in HIV-positive individuals ( Stadelman et al . , 2020; Thwaites et al . , 2013 ) . A long-standing hypothesis that an excessive intracerebral inflammatory response underlies TBM mortality ( Shane and Riley , 1953 ) led to multiple trials of adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids ( e . g . dexamethasone ) ( Prasad et al . , 2016; Wilkinson et al . , 2017 ) . Findings from a randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) in Vietnam that adjunctive dexamethasone improved survival by ~30% led to it becoming standard of care treatment ( Thwaites et al . , 2004 ) . However , the modest benefit of adjunctive dexamethasone treatment suggested a heterogeneity in glucocorticoid-responsiveness ( Donald and Schoeman , 2004; Schoeman and Donald , 2013 ) . Findings in a zebrafish model of TB provided a testable hypothesis for a mechanism underlying this heterogeneity ( Thwaites et al . , 2004; Tobin et al . , 2012; Tobin et al . , 2010 ) . The zebrafish findings suggested that either deficiency or excess of leukotriene A4 hydrolase ( LTA4H ) , a key enzyme that regulates the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids , increase susceptibility to TBM for opposite reasons - too little or too much inflammation ( Tobin et al . , 2012; Tobin et al . , 2010 ) . It became possible to test the prediction when a common human functional LTA4H promoter variant ( rs17525495 ) was identified comprising a C/T transition that controlled LTA4H expression , with the T allele causing increased expression ( Tobin et al . , 2012 ) . A retrospective analysis of patient LTA4H rs17525495 genotypes in the Vietnam dexamethasone RCT cohort confirmed the prediction ( Thwaites et al . , 2004; Tobin et al . , 2012 ) . Among HIV-negative patients , the survival benefit of dexamethasone was restricted to patients with the hyper-inflammatory TT genotype , with CC patients potentially harmed by this treatment ( Tobin et al . , 2012 ) . These findings supported the model that mortality from TBM was due to two distinct inflammatory states , and that LTA4H genotype might be a critical determinant of inflammation and consequently of the response to adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment . If true , then personalized genotype-directed adjunctive glucocorticoid treatment would be warranted , with the drug given only to TT patients . This would be particularly important given the possible harm to the hypo-inflammatory CC group , as well as the adverse effects of long-term high dose treatment with a broadly acting immunosuppressant . To further these findings , two new studies of the association of LTA4H genotype with TBM survival in HIV-negative patients were performed in Vietnam and Indonesia , respectively ( Thuong et al . , 2017; van Laarhoven et al . , 2017 ) . Because glucocorticoid adjunctive therapy had become standard of care owing to the benefit observed in the randomised controlled trial ( Thwaites et al . , 2004 ) , all patients received it in both studies . Therefore , the prediction that could be tested was that TT mortality is less than CC+CT mortality . Whereas the Vietnam study confirmed this prediction , the Indonesia study did not . The Vietnam cohort had an overall mortality of 18 . 8% , similar to that reported in the literature ( Stadelman et al . , 2020 ) . A striking feature of the Indonesia cohort was its more than two-fold increased mortality in comparison with the Vietnam cohort . Moreover , most of the Indonesia cohort deaths occurred early with a median time to death of eight days versus 50 days in Vietnam ( Table 1 ) . This high early mortality raised the possibility that the impact of the LTA4H variant differs by disease severity , and may not be relevant in more severe disease ( Fava and Schurr , 2017 ) . If so , then the effects of the LTA4H genotype were being masked by the preponderance of extremely severe cases in the Indonesia cohort ( Fava and Schurr , 2017 ) . Both studies used , as the primary metric of significance testing , Cox regression modelling , an approach that assumes that the ratio of hazard rates between groups is constant throughout the observed period ( Bradburn et al . , 2003; Greenland et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , this analytical method could miss important differences in these studies of TBM , a disease which can present acutely yet have a prolonged time-course with vastly differing mortality risks over time ( Thuong et al . , 2017; Thwaites et al . , 2013; van Laarhoven et al . , 2017 ) . Moreover , testing the hypothesis that LTA4H effects are limited to specific disease severity grades requires subgroup analysis . The use of frequentist statistics would limit the ability to perform such subgroup analyses because the penalties it sets for multiple comparisons do not reflect real-world situations ( Gelman and Loken , 2013; Smith and Ebrahim , 2002 ) . Bayesian analysis is ideally suited to simultaneously estimate treatment effects in multiple subgroups because it results in different interactions with the number of results obtained which are much less problematic than those arising in frequentist analysis ( Box 1 and Appendix 1 ) . Therefore , we used a Bayesian approach to analyse data from the two cohorts ( Gelman and Loken , 2013; MacKay , 2003; Zampieri et al . , 2020 ) ( Appendix 2 ) . Bayesian analysis also enables the detection of significant differences that might be limited to just a part of the time-course and therefore would allow analysis to be independent of the kinetics of death in the Vietnam and Indonesia cohorts . Medical management decisions are guided by an assessment of the probabilities of outcome . In TBM , the question faced by the clinician is how likely is glucocorticoid therapy going to help or harm a patient . Bayesian paradigms , unlike frequentist ones , understand probability in a real-world way , using it to indicate the plausibility of a particular conclusion ( MacKay , 2003; Zampieri et al . , 2020 ) . Finally , relevant to this re-analysis of completed clinical studies , Bayesian paradigms have less potential for bias arising from post-hoc analysis ( Appendix 1 ) . The severity grade-specific analyses , coupled with temporal analyses made possible by Bayesian methods , reveal that the LTA4H TT genotype is associated with survival in both cohorts . 
 The age range of patients was similar in the Vietnam and Indonesia cohorts with Indonesia patients tending to be younger ( Table 1 ) . We compared the cohorts for disease severity on presentation using both measures used in the studies , the Glasgow Coma Score ( GCS ) and the modified British Medical Research Council TBM grade ( TBM grade ) ( Box 2 ) . The Indonesia cohort had more severe disease on presentation by both measures ( Table 1 and Figure 1 ) . We used the TBM grade for further analyses because it divides patients into just three severity groups , making comparisons more feasible . Importantly , it also provides clinically relevant separation of GCS 15 patients , the most highly represented in both cohorts ( Figure 1 ) , into those with and without focal neurological signs . Because the Indonesia cohort was skewed towards more severe disease on presentation , one explanation for the lack of an LTA4H genotype association with survival in Indonesia was that the underlying association is overridden by severe disease , a strong independent correlate of mortality ( Fava and Schurr , 2017; Wang et al . , 2019 ) . Indeed , a detailed comparison of the Vietnam and Indonesia cohorts showed that 76% of Indonesia patients presented in Grade 2 versus 47% of the Vietnam patients ( Table 1 ) . This increase was driven entirely by a shift from Grade 1 ( 9% vs 37% in Vietnam ) . The cohorts had nearly equal proportions of Grade 3 patients ( 15% each ) . Therefore , the ~2 fold-increased overall mortality in Indonesia could be largely accounted for by a corresponding increase of Grade 2 patients ( 1 . 6 fold higher than Vietnam ) . Disease severity as assessed by BMRC Grade or GCS at presentation is also a strong predictor of earlier death ( Fava and Schurr , 2017; Wang et al . , 2019 ) , and the Indonesia patients died sooner ( median time to death 8 days versus 50 days in Vietnam ) ( Table 1 ) . If LTA4H genotype associates with survival most strongly in mild disease , then the association seen for the entire Vietnam cohort ( Thuong et al . , 2017 ) should be strongest in Grade 1 patients . We tested this prediction with Bayesian analysis using a prior that was intentionally uninformative and very wide , while still being centred on clinician-expected survival curves and hazard rates . We included additional parameters to allow for the possibility that not all patient deaths would be linked to the same mode of death . Importantly , the model and priors used allowed us to incorporate our pre-existing knowledge that mortality risk to a population of TBM patients varies smoothly with time , rather than occurring at a number of discrete times common to all patients as is implied by the maximum likelihood solution illustrated by a Kaplan-Meier plot . The details of the model and the priors are in Appendix 2 . The definitions of terms and abbreviations used throughout the paper are in Box 3 . In the original Vietnam study , the TT genotype was associated with survival and the CC and CT genotypes had similarly increased mortality over TT ( Thuong et al . , 2017 ) , so we compared TT survival to that of CT and CC combined ( non-TT ) . We first confirmed that the TT variant distribution did not differ by grade on presentation ( Table 2 ) . Bayesian analysis confirmed that the TT genotype was associated with a survival advantage in the overall cohort ( Figure 2A ) . Moreover , the analysis revealed that this survival advantage manifested early and persisted over most of the observation period ( Figure 2A ) . The Bayesian method enables a more detailed evaluation of mortality risk over time through a hazard rate analysis . This analysis reinforced the significantly higher hazard rate for non-TT starting at 4 days and persisting through 120 days ( Figure 2A , inset ) . As predicted by the earlier analysis , the survival probability between CC and CT was not significantly different at any time during the 270 day observation period ( data not shown ) . When we stratified the Vietnam patients by grade and LTA4H genotype , we got a surprising result . The LTA4H TT association with survival was barely present in Grade 1 , a bit more in Grade 2 , and strongest in Grade 3 where it reached significance ( Figure 2B–D ) . Similar to the overall cohort , the Grade 3 increased survival probability for TT also manifested early and persisted throughout ( Figure 2D ) . Hazard rate analysis again showed that non-TT patients had a greatly increased risk of mortality very early ( Figure 2D , inset ) . The non-TT over TT hazard rate ratio peaked at 16 on day 3 ( Figure 2D , inset ) . This early high peak dropped only gradually over time; it was 5 at day 100 and remained >1 throughout ( data not shown ) . Again survival of CC and CT patients was not significantly different at any time during the 270 day observation period ( data not shown ) . In sum , our analysis revealed that in Vietnam , LTA4H TT was associated with survival , not in mild disease as suggested earlier ( Fava and Schurr , 2017 ) , but rather in the most severe disease grade . In fact , the bulk of the overall association was being driven by Grade 3 patients who constituted only 15 . 9% of the cohort ( Table 1 ) . Non-TT patients were at greatest risk of dying within days of admission , a risk that diminished with time but remained greater than the TT patients throughout . Bayesian analysis found that , in the overall Indonesia cohort , survival of the TT patient group was higher than non-TT though falling short of significance ( maximum probability 0 . 92 ) ( Figure 2E ) . Moreover , this analysis detected that the hazard rate for non-TT patients was higher than TT patients from day 1 to day 13; the non-TT over TT ratio reached significance on days 2 and 3 , at which time the non-TT hazard rate was twice that of TT . Thus , while the TT beneficial effect was weaker than in Vietnam ( compare Figure 2E–A ) , hazard rate analysis showed that as in Vietnam , TT benefit manifested early ( Figure 2E inset , compare to Figure 2A inset ) . For the grade-stratified cohorts , the analysis of Grade 1 patients was uninformative as there was only one TT patient in this group who survived throughout ( Table 2 and Figure 2F; also see Appendix 2 , section 4 ) . In Grade 2 , the TT survival effect was significant , in contrast to Grade 2 Vietnam ( compare Figure 2G–C ) . Rather , the pattern of the Grade 2 association was similar to Vietnam Grade 3 with a significant early TT survival benefit . As in Vietnam , the TT survival benefit started within days with an early hazard rate peak for the non-TT group . In Grade 3 , the LTA4H TT effect was again absent ( Figure 2H ) . As in Vietnam , survival of CC and CT patients was not significantly different at any time during the analysis for the overall cohort and for each of the three grades ( data not shown ) . Since Grade 2 patients constitute the bulk of the Indonesia cohort ( 75 . 5% ) , why was the LTA4H genotype effect in this grade not reflected in the overall cohort analysis ? This was particularly curious given that in Vietnam the overall significant effect was being driven very substantially by Grade 3 patients who constituted only 15 . 9% of the cohort . We saw that the LTA4H TT benefit was weaker and less prolonged in Indonesia Grade 2 than in Vietnam Grade 3 ( compare Figure 2G to D ) . Non-TT patients had similar mortality in Indonesia Grade 2 and Vietnam Grade 3 ( compare Figure 2G to D ) . Thus , Bayesian analysis revealed an LTA4H TT survival association in Indonesia as well . The association being only in Grade 2 and not in Grade 3 patients suggested an upper limit of disease severity for its efficacy . Why might LTA4H effects stop after Grade 2 in Indonesia ? A closer comparison of the overall survival between the two sites suggested that there were mortality differences between the two cohorts for all grades combined and in grade-for-grade comparisons that were LTA4H-independent ( Figure 2 ) . For instance , Indonesia Grade 2 non-TT patients had a mortality risk similar to that of Vietnam Grade 3 non-TT patients ( compare Figures 2D and 1G ) . We confirmed by Bayesian analysis that within each cohort , mortality risk increased with grade severity ( Thuong et al . , 2017; van Laarhoven et al . , 2017; Figure 3 ) . From early on , Grade 1 survival was significantly greater than Grade 2 , which was significantly greater than Grade 3 ( Figure 3A and B ) . The hazard rate ratios highlighted that while the risk of increased mortality with higher grade was highest early , it was sustained long-term ( Figure 3C and D ) . Importantly , both the survival and hazard rate analyses again pointed to an increased grade-for-grade risk of mortality in Indonesia over Vietnam . Next , we directly compared grade-for-grade mortality between the cohorts . Vietnam survival probability was higher in all grades , and significantly so for Grades 2 and 3 with survival gaps of 18% and 24% , respectively ( Figure 4A , C and E ) . Similarly , hazard rates did not differ significantly between the cohorts in Grade 1 ( Figure 4B ) , but there was a significant and substantial increase in early hazard rates for Indonesia Grades 2 and 3 ( Figure 4D and F ) . We ruled out the possibility that this increased mortality was because the Indonesia patients had more severe disease within each grade as reflected in the GCS . While they had somewhat more severe disease in Grade 2 , in Grade 3 where the difference was the most pronounced , they had milder disease ( Figure 1 ) . In sum , these analyses show that the inherent higher mortality associated with more severe disease on presentation was sharply accentuated in Indonesia . Indonesia grade 2 patients experienced similar mortality risk as Vietnam Grade 3 patients with the Indonesia Grade 3 patients experiencing far greater mortality . This higher mortality could potentially explain the finding that the LTA4H TT survival advantage did not extend to Indonesia Grade 3 patients . It may be that the TT genotype advantage , in response to corticosteroid treatment , is overridden by other factors that cause extreme mortality . 
 The finding in two independent cohorts in Vietnam collected from 2001 to 2004 and 2011–2015 that a common functional human variant was associated with responsiveness to adjunctive glucocorticoid treatment in TBM represented an ideal example of pharmacogenomics , coming as it did from mechanistic understanding of the underlying reason ( Sadée and Dai , 2005; Thuong et al . , 2017; Tobin et al . , 2012 ) . The potential importance of these findings was heightened with subsequent pathway analyses in the zebrafish ( where the LTA4H link to disease severity was discovered ) identifying more specific , inexpensive , steroid-sparing drugs that might circumvent LTA4H-mediated pathology ( Roca and Ramakrishnan , 2013; Roca et al . , 2019 ) . It was disappointing and puzzling when a similar study of TBM patients in Indonesia failed to find a significant association ( van Laarhoven et al . , 2017 ) . In a commentary published alongside the Indonesia and second Vietnam studies , Fava and Schurr suggested that background genetic differences between the cohorts might account for the lack of an LTA4H association ( Fava and Schurr , 2017 ) . However , noting that the Indonesia cohort presented with more severe disease and died earlier , they postulated that rather than invoking an unknown genetic phenomenon , it was more likely that the beneficial effects of dexamethasone for the LTA4H TT genotype were nullified in more severe disease . This concept of the disease being too severe for outcomes to be influenced by intervention has precedent . The beneficial effect of fluoroquinolones in TBM is present in Grade1 or 2 disease , but lost in Grade 3 disease ( Thwaites et al . , 2011 ) . To test if increased grade severity on presentation in Indonesia was sufficient to account for the loss of the LTA4H TT survival effect , a grade-for-grade analysis within and between the two cohorts was necessary , while taking into account the temporal changes in mortality risk over the several months-long observation period . Moreover , both the magnitude and the time to mortality seemed to vary dramatically between the cohorts ( Table 1 ) . We realized that Bayesian methods were ideal for these complex and intrinsically multivariate comparisons and possibly the only path to a biologically and clinically relevant understanding . When we analysed the Vietnam cohort separated by grade severity , we saw that there was indeed a relationship between LTA4H effect and grade severity . However , it was opposite to what had been predicted ( Fava and Schurr , 2017 ) . The TT survival benefit became stronger not weaker with increasing grade . The analysis also suggested the reason for this . Patients with mild disease on presentation did well regardless of LTA4H genotype , so that the added benefit of the TT genotype was small . In Indonesia , the LTA4H TT effect was present in Grade 2 and completely absent in Grade 3 , a finding that was perplexing until we analysed the LTA4H-independent mortality risk of the two cohorts . The Indonesia cohort did not just contain a greater number of patients presenting at a more severe grade as had been noted earlier ( Fava and Schurr , 2017 ) , but patients in this cohort had substantially higher early mortality than their Vietnam counterparts even grade-for-grade ( Table 1 ) . Indonesia patients had nearly twice the mortality risk in Grade 2 and ~50% higher risk in Grade 3 . Tellingly , Grade 2 Indonesia overall mortality risk was virtually identical to Grade 3 Vietnam ( 38% versus 37 . 9% ) , suggesting that this level of overall mortality represents the boundary of the beneficial effect of LTA4H TT . Thus , LTA4H TT efficacy was limited by other factors that cause mortality . These factors appear independent of severity grade on presentation , and if they exceed a threshold ( represented by about ~40% mortality ) then the beneficial effect of LTA4H TT is lost . A limitation of this study is that we cannot definitively determine the causes of this LTA4H genotype-independent excess Grade 3 mortality in Indonesia because the patient populations , hospital care protocols and the availability of intensive care differed between each study site . One possibility is that better ancillary care was possible in Vietnam where all patients were enrolled into a clinical trial versus only 17% in Indonesia ( Thuong et al . , 2017; van Laarhoven et al . , 2017 ) . The excess Grade 3 Indonesia mortality peaked within days , and optimized respiratory support , in particular , would be essential to keep patients alive through the early high risk stage in order allow for anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids to benefit the TT patients . Thus the beneficial effect of dexamethasone to the LTA4H TT group may simply not have had time to come into play in Grade 3 Indonesia patients . A second possibility is that Indonesia Grade 3 patients presented with a greater degree of dysregulated inflammation in a manner not revealed by standard metrics of judging disease severity . If this were the case then corticosteroids might no longer be beneficial . Since both TT and non-TT patients suffered identical excess mortality risk , its cause would have been LTA4H-independent . Indonesia patients tended to be younger than Vietnam patients in all grades ( Table 1 ) , and perhaps were more prone to develop such a response . Such a previously unrecognized form of dysregulated inflammation might be caused by other genetic variants uniquely present in the Indonesia patients and would work through an inflammatory pathway that is less responsive to dexamethasone . Why was the LTA4H TT effect thought to be limited to the least severe patients in both cohorts ( Fava and Schurr , 2017 ) ? Two reasons might explain this . First , it was not appreciated that apart from having fewer Grade 1 patients , Indonesia patients also suffered higher grade-for-grade mortality risk ( Fava and Schurr , 2017 ) . Second , because of a paucity of less severe patients , a subgroup analysis was performed in an attempt to tease out an effect in this group . Patients were divided into GCS 14–15 ( less severe ) versus <13 ( more severe ) , and a nonsignificant TT survival benefit was found in the GCS 14–15 group only , supporting the idea that TT effects , if any , were limited to the less severe group ( Figure 5A and B ) . However , our analysis now shows the two reasons why this grouping resulted in the LTA4H TT effect going unrecognized: ( 1 ) GCS 15 does not separate patients by whether or not they have neurological signs , so it includes all BMRC Grade 1 and some BMRC Grade 2 patients ( Box 2 ) ; ( 2 ) the grouping used resulted in the Grade 2 patients being split so that some were grouped with Grade 3 and the remaining with Grade 1; ( 3 ) of the 11 TT patients in the GCS 14–15 grouping only 1 TT patient was in Grade 1 , with the remaining 10 in Grade 2 , so the effect seen in their GCS 14–15 was entirely from Grade 2 patients ( compare Figure 5B–C ) . In any case this subgroup TT effect would have been impossible to detect with the frequentist analyses used . The use of Bayesian methods has identified subgroups of TT patients that gain the most survival benefit from dexamethasone treatment . Our findings set the stage for using Bayesian methods for subgroup analyses of the ongoing trial with the goal of comparing the survival of CC and CT patients randomised to dexamethasone or placebo , and also comparing the survival of each of these groups individually and combined to TT patients who are all getting dexamethasone ( Donovan et al . , 2018; Donovan and Phu , 2020 ) . Finally , in addition to providing guidance for TBM pharmacogenomic approaches , we hope that our analyses highlight the unique value of Bayesian methods for providing guidance for other complex diseases with difficult treatment decisions . The vital importance of defining the patient populations and subgroups which will benefit the most from specialised interventions and treatments is increasingly appreciated ( Sadée and Dai , 2005 ) . This is not only to target such treatments to those who will benefit , but to avoid their adverse effects in those individuals who have little chance of experiencing a clinically relevant benefit from them . Our finding that the LTA4H TT genotype’s salutary role is incumbent on the optimization of other factors that maximize patient survival has broad implications for pharmacogenomic approaches . 
 The anonymized patient cohort data used here has been previously described in detail ( Thuong et al . , 2017; van Laarhoven et al . , 2017 ) . Our analysis included all 439 HIV-negative patients from the Vietnam study and 376 of the 515 HIV-negative patients from the Indonesia study . The remaining 139 Indonesian patients were excluded for lack of information on LTA4H rs17525495 genotype ( 87 ) , baseline disease severity ( 44 ) or outcome ( 8 ) ( Supplementary file 1 ) . All Vietnam patients were admitted to one of two tertiary care referral hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam: Pham Ngoc Thach Hospital for Tuberculosis and Lung Disease ( designated Hospital 1 ) and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases ( designated Hospital 2 ) ( Heemskerk et al . , 2016 ) . All patients were treated with adjunctive dexamethasone for the first 6–8 weeks with the regimen adjusted to disease severity on presentation ( Thwaites et al . , 2004 ) . Patient cohorts were compared overall as well as stratified into disease severity groups based on the TBM grade and by LTA4H genotypes , into the TT group ( previously linked to response to steroids ) and the CC , CT , and combined CC and CT genotypes ( non-TT group ) . The Bayesian analysis methods to compare survival probabilities are detailed in Appendix 2 . We limited analysis to the first 9 months of the one-year observation period in Indonesia to be compatible with the 9 month observation period in Vietnam . For the data in Tables 1 and 2 , Bayesian posterior probabilities for the comparisons of genotype and GCS frequencies , for each bin separately and for the mean of the distribution , were based on a flat Dirichlet prior on the bin probabilities . Comparisons of age and time to median mortality were done using comparisons of arithmetic means of distributions , allowing Bayesian model choice between the following distribution families: Gaussian , log-Gaussian , Student , log-Student , Gamma , inverse-Gamma , Gamma-power . For age , log-Gaussian had overall the highest posterior probability; for time to median mortality , inverse-Gamma was preferred .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']","['microbiology and infectious disease', 'genetics and genomics']",elife-61722-v2,269,5023,4754,18.6728624535316

Further , the airflow over bird wings can be highly turbulent , meaning it can generate loud sounds , like the jets of air coming out of the engines of aircraft . Given all the sound-generating mechanisms at hand , it is difficult to determine why some wings buzz whereas others whoosh or hum . Hightower , Wijnings et al . wanted to understand the physical mechanism that causes animal wings to whine , buzz , hum or whoosh in flight . They hypothesized that the aerodynamic forces generated by animal wings are the main source of their characteristic wing sounds . Hummingbird wings have the most features in common with different animals’ wings , while also featuring acoustically complex feathers . This makes them ideal models for deciphering how birds , bats and even insects make wing sounds . To learn more about wing sounds , Hightower , Wijnings et al . studied how a species of hummingbird called Anna’s hummingbird hums while drinking nectar from a flower . A three-dimensional ‘acoustic hologram’ was generated using 2 , 176 microphones to measure the humming sound from all directions . In a follow-up experiment , the aerodynamic forces the hummingbird wings generate to hover were also measured . Their wingbeat was filmed simultaneously in slow-motion in both experiments . Hightower , Wijnings et al . then used a mathematical model that governs the wing’s aeroacoustics to confirm that the aerodynamic forces generated by the hummingbirds’ wings cause the humming sound heard when they hover in front of a flower . The model shows that the oscillating aerodynamic forces generate harmonics , which give the wings’ hum the acoustic quality of a musical instrument . Using this model Hightower , Wijnings et al . found that the differences in the aerodynamic forces generated by bird and insect wings cause the characteristic timbres of their whines , buzzes , hums , or whooshes . They also determined how these sounds scale with body mass and flapping frequency across 170 insect species and 80 bird species . This showed that mosquitos are unusually loud for their body size due to the unusual unsteadiness of the aerodynamic forces they generate in flight . These results explain why flying animals’ wings sound the way they do – for example , why larger birds are quieter and mosquitos louder . Better understanding of how the complex forces generated by animal wings create sound can advance the study of how animals change their wingbeat to communicate . Further , the model that explains how complex aerodynamic forces cause sound can help make the sounds of aerial robots , drones , and fans not only more silent , but perhaps more pleasing , like the hum of a hummingbird .","How hummingbirds hum is not fully understood , but its biophysical origin is encoded in the acoustic nearfield . Hence , we studied six freely hovering Anna’s hummingbirds , performing acoustic nearfield holography using a 2176 microphone array in vivo , while also directly measuring the 3D aerodynamic forces using a new aerodynamic force platform . We corroborate the acoustic measurements by developing an idealized acoustic model that integrates the aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics , which shows how the timbre of the hummingbird’s hum arises from the oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing . Comparing birds and insects , we find that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of their flapping wings originates from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces that support their bodyweight . Our model analysis across insects and birds shows that allometric deviation makes larger birds quieter and elongated flies louder , while also clarifying complex bioacoustic behavior . 
 Birds , bats , and insects flap their wings to generate unsteady aerodynamic forces that lift their body into the air , which enables them to fly . When their flapping wings move through air , they create unsteady pressure fluctuations that radiate outward at the speed of sound . In addition to furnishing flight , pressure waves serve various acoustic communication functions during behavioral displays . Male Drosophila use aerodynamically functional wings to create humming songs near their flapping frequency to increase female receptivity to mating ( von Schilcher , 1976 ) . In a more sophisticated form of courtship behavior , male and female mosquitoes duet at the third harmonic ( multiple ) of their wingbeat frequency ( Cator et al . , 2009 ) . In contrast , pigeons use modified primary feathers that sonate around 1 kHz when they start flapping their wings that incite flock members to fleeing and take-off behavior ( Davis , 1975; Hingee and Magrath , 2009; Niese and Tobalske , 2016; Murray et al . , 2017 ) . Feather sonation during flapping flight may also communicate information like flight speed , location in 3D space , and wingbeat frequency to conspecifics ( Larsson , 2012 ) . Hence , male broad-tailed hummingbirds generate a whistling sound with modified primary feathers in their flapping wings during displays to defend courting territories ( Miller and Inouye , 1983 ) . Silent fliers like owls , on the other hand , suppress the aerodynamic sound generated by their wings to mitigate interference with their hearing and escape prey detection ( Geyer et al . , 2013; Jaworski and Peake , 2020; Kroeger et al . , 1972; Sarradj et al . , 2011; Clark et al . , 2020 ) . Their flapping wings also generate less structural noise ( Clark et al . , 2020 ) because their feathers lack the noisy directional fastening mechanism that locks adjacent flight feathers during wing extension in other bird species ( Matloff et al . , 2020 ) . These diverse adaptations illustrate how a wide range of mechanisms can contribute to the sound that flapping wings generate . Consequently , it is not fully understood how flapping wings generate their characteristic sound—from the mosquito’s buzz , the hummingbird’s hum , to the larger bird’s whoosh . Our physical understanding of how wings generate sound is primarily based on aircraft wing and rotor aeroacoustics ( Brooks and Pope , 1989; Crighton , 1991 ) . In contrast to animals , however , engineered wings do not flap , do not change shape dynamically , are much larger , and operate at much higher speeds ( higher Reynolds numbers ) . They also operate at lower angles of attack to avoid stall , which results in more compact airflow patterns than animals generate in flapping flight ( Ellington et al . , 1996; Dickinson et al . , 1999; Mueller , 2001 ) . Despite these marked differences , rotors and flapping wings have one thing in common: they both revolve around a center pivot . Whereas flapping wings reciprocate along the joint , rotors revolve unidirectionally . The revolution of rotors generates loud tonal noise , because the pressure field they generate rotates in space at the same frequency ( Lighthill , 1954; Lowson , 1965 ) . Similarly , when animals flap their wing back and forth along the shoulder joint during each stroke , they create a high-pressure region below their wing and a low-pressure region above . The pressure differences are associated with the wing’s high lift and drag , respectively ( Sane and Dickinson , 2001; Wu and Sun , 2004 ) . Computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) simulations of flapping insect wings suggest that the acoustic field can be characterized as a dipole at the wingbeat frequency ( Bae and Moon , 2008; Geng et al . , 2017; Seo et al . , 2019 ) . Further , flapping wing pitch reduction ( Nedunchezian et al . , 2018 ) and increased wing flexibility ( Nedunchezian et al . , 2019 ) reduces the simulated nearfield sound pressure level . All these findings point to the potential role of oscillating aerodynamic forces in generating wing hum . Indeed , numerical simulation of the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings aeroacoustic equation ( Williams and Hawkings , 1969 ) showed that the farfield hum of flapping mosquito wings is primarily driven by aerodynamic force fluctuation ( Seo et al . , 2019 ) . Despite these important advances , in vivo acoustic near-field measurements are lacking . Finally , there is no simple model that can satisfactorily integrate flapping wing kinematics and aerodynamic forces to predict the acoustic near and far field generated by animals across taxa without using computationally expensive fluid dynamic simulations . Hummingbirds are an ideal subject for developing and testing a model of flapping wing hum: their wing kinematics and unsteady aerodynamic forces are very repeatable during hover ( Altshuler and Dudley , 2003; Tobalske et al . , 2007; Ingersoll and Lentink , 2018 ) . Further , hummingbird wing morphology and flight style share similarities with both birds and insects . In addition to high-frequency feather sonations , hummingbirds produce a prominent hum that is qualitatively similar to an insect’s buzz . Earlier aeroacoustics studies of hummingbirds have resolved the farfield acoustic pressure field at a distance greater than 10 or more body lengths away from the hummingbird ( Clark and Mistick , 2018a; Clark , 2008; Clark et al . , 2016; Clark and Mistick , 2018b ) . While this distance relates to how humans perceive and interact with these animals , hummingbirds frequently interact with conspecifics and other animals at more intimate distances—in the acoustic nearfield . Furthermore , wing hum can announce a hummingbird's presence , especially to the opposite sex ( Hunter , 2008 ) . Although their audiogram has yet to be established below 1 kHz ( Pytte et al . , 2004 ) , this and other behavioral evidence suggests hummingbirds may be able to perceive the wing hum from a conspecific . Finally , the hum may reveal the hummingbird’s presence to predators in plant clutter when vision is obstructed . To resolve how the oscillating aerodynamic force generated by flapping wings may contribute to wing hum , we developed a new aerodynamic force platform ( Ingersoll and Lentink , 2018; Lentink et al . , 2015; Hightower et al . , 2017 ) to directly measure the net 3D aerodynamic force generated by freely hovering hummingbirds . We integrated this data in a new aeroacoustics model to predict the sound radiated due to the oscillating forces from flapping wings . Our model is idealized in the sense that it assumes the wings are rigid airfoils , thereby neglecting auxiliary effects such as wingtip flutter , feather whistle and ( turbulent ) vortex dynamics . Next , we compared the predicted acoustic field with novel acoustic nearfield recordings for six freely hovering hummingbirds , which corroborates the predictive power of our minimal model . We then used our validated model to determine how flapping wing hum depends on the frequency content in the oscillating forces across mosquitos , flies , hawkmoths , hummingbirds , and parrotlets in slow hovering flight . Finally , we used these findings to determine how the hum scales with body mass and flapping frequency across 170 insect and bird species . 
 To determine how the flapping wings of hovering hummingbirds generate unsteady aerodynamic forces as well as their namesake acoustic humming signature , we combine aerodynamic force platform ( Figure 1A ) and microphone array recordings ( Figure 1D ) in vivo . The aerodynamic force platform integrates both the steady and unsteady components of the pressure field around the bird up to three times the wingbeat frequency , which are associated with its net 3D aerodynamic forces . In contrast , the microphone arrays measure the unsteady component of the pressure field around the bird up to ~1000 times the wingbeat frequency ( of which we studied the first ten harmonics ) : the acoustic field . Critically , these two representations of the pressure fluctuations generated by the bird should relate mechanistically if the acoustic field of the hummingbird’s hum originates primarily from the oscillating aerodynamic lift and drag forces generated by the flapping wings . The oscillating 3D aerodynamic forces were recorded simultaneously with the wingbeat kinematics using three calibrated stereo high-speed camera pairs ( Figure 1A; N = 6 birds , n = 2 flights per bird , n = 5 wingbeats per flight: 60 total wingbeats ) . We combined the 3D aerodynamic forces , 3D wing kinematics and wing morphology measurements to decompose the oscillating lift and drag forces that each wing generates throughout the wingbeat ( Figure 1B , C ) . The oscillating lift trace consists primarily of the peak force generated during downstroke , which corresponds to a peak in its spectrum at the first wingbeat harmonic ( 44 . 2 ± 1 . 8 Hz ) . The drag trace consists of two equivalent drag peaks during the upstroke and downstroke , which corresponds to a dominant peak in its spectrum at the second harmonic . We also measured the 3D beak contact force on the artificial flower from which the hummingbird was feeding , which is negligible ( 5 . 2 ± 2 . 3% bodyweight ) . The 3D acoustic field associated with the bird’s hum was quantitatively reconstructed from measurements recorded in a custom flight arena using four acoustic arrays ( Figure 1D; N = 6 birds , n = 18 flights total , see Supplementary file 1 for details ) . The recording by a single microphone centered above the bird shows a typical pressure trace throughout a single wingbeat ( Figure 1E ) . The many fluctuations explain the rich frequency content revealed in the acoustic spectrum averaged over all microphones ( Figure 1F ) . These include strong peaks at the fundamental frequencies of the wingbeat as well as its higher harmonics , which rise prominently above the background noise floor and characterize the hummingbird hum . To determine if the low frequency oscillating forces generated by the birds’ flapping wings drive the characteristic humming sound spectrum , we develop a simple aeroacoustics model based on the governing acoustics equations that predict the resulting acoustic field . Our minimal model of the acoustic pressure field radiated by the flapping wings ( Figure 1G ) depends only on the physical properties of air , the wing stroke kinematics ( Figure 1H ) , and the oscillating lift and drag forces that we measured in vivo ( Figure 1B ) . Aerodynamic analysis of propellers shows how a radial force distribution can be integrated and represented by the net force at the center of pressure , a characteristic radial location where the net force acts ( Weis-Fogh , 1973 ) . Analogously , we determine that the acoustic sound radiation of an unsteady aerodynamic force distribution over the wing can also be concentrated into an equivalent point force at the effective acoustic source location along the wing , similar to propeller noise theory ( Lowson , 1965 ) . The effective radius of this point , measured with respect to the shoulder joint , is equal to the point at which the net drag force results in the same net torque on the wing ( Lowson , 1965 ) . This radius lies at the wing-length-normalized third moment of area for flapping wings , R3/R ( Weis-Fogh , 1973 ) . For Anna’s hummingbirds R3/R is equal to 55% wing radius ( Kruyt et al . , 2014 ) . In practice , the effective radius for acoustic calculations can differ somewhat from the effective radius for a point force ( Lowson , 1965 ) . Therefore , we conduct a dimensional analysis to determine how acoustic pressure scales with radial position ( see Supplementary Information for details ) , which confirms R3 is the appropriate radius . This acoustic radius agrees with wind turbine acoustics measurements at lower harmonics of the blade passing frequency ( Oerlemans et al . , 2001 ) . Starting at the time and location where the acoustic wave was generated by the unsteady force on the left and right wing , we numerically solve how the acoustic wave propagates outward into space to the location where we observe it with a microphone . Mathematically , the acoustic equation describes how the unsteady aerodynamic point force , Fwing , generated by the flapping wing generates an air pressure fluctuation , p , in the stationary atmosphere at the so-called ‘retarded time’ , t , which radiates outward as a wave at the speed of sound , ao , as follows Lowson , 1965: ( 1 ) p=[14π|r|2 ( 1−Mr ) 2 ( 1|r| ( 1−M2 ) ( 1−Mr ) ( r⋅Fwing ) − ( Fwing⋅M ) ) ]⏟nearfield+[14πao|r|2 ( 1−Mr ) 2 ( ( r⋅∂Fwing∂t ) +11−Mr∂Mr∂t ( r⋅Fwing ) ) ]⏟farfield . The brackets indicate that the propagating pressure values , p , are evaluated at the retarded time , t . The vectorial distance from the moving point source on the flapping wing to the stationary microphone is measured by the vector , r , in a Cartesian reference frame fixed to earth . The wing’s velocity at the radial position where the point force acts , vR3 , is nondimensionalized with the acoustic wave velocity , ao , the speed of sound , which defines in the Mach vector M=defvR3/ao . The Mach number is simply the magnitude of the Mach vector M=def|M| . Similarly , the convective Mach number , Mr=defM⋅r/|r| , is simply the component of the Mach vector , M , along the vector , r , that runs from the wing source to the microphone . The acoustic pressure fluctuation , p , consists out of two components of which the respective strengths depend on how far the microphone is located away from the wing—measured in wavelengths of the acoustic frequency of interest ( Howe , 2014 ) . For a flapping hummingbird wing we choose the wingbeat frequency , because it is associated with the first harmonic we observe in the humming spectrum ( Figure 1F ) , λ1=a0/f1≈343/44 . 2=7 . 8 m . The first term in Equation 1 dominates in the nearfield close to the wing up to a wavelength away from it . The associated pressure wave has a 3D dipole shape radiating in two opposing directions . Its strength is proportional to the force vector reorientation in space with respect to the radial vector , r , pointing from the source to the microphone . The second term dominates in the farfield starting at a wavelength away from the wing . The associated pressure wave has a 3D quadrupole shape along four primary directions . Its strength is proportional to the point force unsteadiness and the radial acceleration of its position in space . In the case of a hummingbird , the nearfield term decays exponentially with distance . This is because the hummingbird acts as a compact acoustic source ( Rienstra and Hirschberg , 2004 ) , since the wavelength at the wingbeat frequency ( first harmonic ) is much larger than the radius of the wing , R , the representative acoustic source length scale: R/λ1=0 . 007 for R=0 . 058±0 . 003 m . Consequently , a hummingbird wing acts as an approximate compact acoustic source up to its tenth wingbeat harmonic ( 10⋅f1 ) with wavelength λ10=a0/f10≈343/442=0 . 78 m . Because the hummingbird wing is acoustically compact across all the humming frequencies we study here , the wing is effectively acoustically transparent . The sound scattering over the wing is negligible and the time differences between local sound generating sources distributed over the wing can be ignored . Indeed , we observe a median difference of 0 . 1 dB between a single source model and a distributed model with 10 sources ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1A , Supplementary file 2 ) . The associated acoustic holograms of both models match spatially ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1B ) , confirming hummingbird wings are compact acoustic sources at humming frequencies . Using Equation 1 , we calculate the resulting pressure fluctuation at each of the 2176 microphones in our acoustic arena to directly compare the simulated and measured humming sound up to the tenth harmonic . Beyond the tenth harmonic the ambient noise floor of the experiment is approached ( Figures 1F and 2A ) . Since the in vivo flapping frequency is used as an input to our model , Equation 1 , there is exact frequency agreement between the modeled and in vivo spectra ( Figure 2A ) . Spatially , the model captures the wingstroke transitions in the top and front arrays in the holograms ( Figure 2B ) . The model and recordings are in good agreement , because the difference in the magnitude of the sound pressure is ~4 dB or less for the first four harmonics ( maximum difference between the model and the measurement ±1 SD; Figure 2A , Table 1 ) . The first four harmonics represent most of the radiated harmonic power: ~99% of the simulated power and ~67% of the measured power for ±2 . 5 Hz bands around each wingbeat harmonic up to 180 Hz . The percentage difference is due to at least three factors: ( i ) harmonics beyond the fourth contribute more power in the measured spectrum than in the simulated spectrum ( Table 2 ) , ( ii ) the experiment's ambient noise floor is substantially higher than the computational noise floor ( Figure 1F ) , and ( iii ) some low amplitude tonal noise sources observed between harmonics cannot be attributed to humming ( Figure 2A ) . The differences across all 10 harmonics may include some acoustic scattering by the wing and body , possible wingtip flutter ( Sane and Jacobson , 2006 ) and turbulent vortex dynamics contributions occurring multiple times during a wingbeat , so they overlap with the measured harmonics . The magnitude of these effects combined is bounded by the differences in the measured and simulated spectra ( Figure 2A ) , which ranges from ~0 . 5 to ~7 . 0 dB ( min . and max . difference ±1 SD; Table 1 ) . The directivity of the acoustic pressure field varies between harmonics . Odd harmonics are associated with a rotational pressure fluctuation mode while even harmonics are associated with a vertical pressure fluctuation mode . To assess the near and farfield directivity , we reconstruct 3D broadband pressure fields ( across 3–500 Hz ) over an entire wingbeat during stationary hovering flight . The reconstructed pressure fields start out at a radius of 8 cm centered on the body such that the inner spherical surface encloses the hummingbird ( the wing radius with respect to the body center is 5 . 8 ± 0 . 3 cm ) and the outer spherical surface ends at a radius of 10 m ( Figure 3A; animation in Video 1 ) . To evaluate acoustic pressure directivity in the nearfield ( 1 m distance , ~8 . 6 wingspans , Figure 3B ) and farfield ( 10 m distance , ~86 wingspans , Figure 3C ) , we calculate the cross-sections of the pressure field in the sagittal ( side ) and coronal ( frontal ) anatomical planes . Averaging directivity plots across all birds and flights , we find the 3D broadband pressure surface is roughly spherical in the nearfield and farfield ( plotted in the middle of Figure 3B , C in black ) . To observe the contribution from each harmonic , we decompose the broadband pressure with a bandwidth of ±2 . 5 Hz around each of the first four harmonics ( Figure 3D–K ) . Each individual directivity plots’ principal axis is oriented perpendicular to the waistline of the dipole lobes we measured ( average , gray line; ±1 standard deviation , light gray arc ) and simulated ( comparison in Table 2 ) . The principal axis is mostly vertical because the net aerodynamic force generated during hover opposes gravity . The dipole shape also manifests in the ovoid 3D pressure surface at these harmonics ( Figure 3D–K ) . The orientation of the measured and predicted broadband holograms in the sagittal and coronal plane agrees within one standard deviation or less ( Figure 3B , C; Table 2 ) . This is explained by the reasonable correspondence between the measured and predicted directivity ( Figure 3D–G ) and amplitude ( Figure 2A ) of the first and second harmonic , which have the largest amplitudes across all harmonics . Both the near and farfield broadband directivity plots are pointed aft in the sagittal plane because the dominant first harmonic is oriented aft . The correspondence between the predicted and measured amplitude ( Table 1 ) and directivity in the sagittal ( but not coronal ) plane ( Table 2 ) weakens starting at the fourth and third harmonic respectively . Higher harmonics contribute less to the broadband directivity , because their amplitude is much lower ( <48 dB beyond the third harmonic , Table 1 ) . Due to the symmetry between the left and right wing , the coronal directivity points upwards at 90° across all measured and simulated harmonics ( Figure 3 , Table 2 ) , showing the hummingbirds performed symmetric hovering flight . In summary , the first harmonic of the hummingbird hum is formed by an acoustic dipole , tilted aft in the coronal plane , which corresponds to the fluctuation of the net vertical and asymmetric horizontal force over a wingbeat . The associated rotational mode can be observed in the time-dependent 3D hologram ( Video 2 ) . The second harmonic is formed by an upward pointing dipole , corresponding to the vertical force generation that occurs twice per wingbeat ( Figure 3F , G ) . This is visible as a vertically oriented mode in the time-dependent 3D hologram ( Video 3 ) . The third harmonic consists also of a rotational mode like the first harmonic ( Figure 3H , I ) , as seen in the time-dependent 3D hologram ( Video 4 ) . Likewise , the fourth harmonic consists of a vertical mode like the second harmonic ( Figure 3J , K; Video 5 ) . Using our model , we predict the acoustic sound generated by flapping wings for a wide range of insects and birds that hover or perform slow flapping flight during takeoff and landing across seven orders of magnitude in body mass , m , and three orders of magnitude in wing flapping frequency , fw . We generalize the flapping animals we consider here into five distinct groups for which we found data: generalist birds ( Aves except Trochilidae ) , hummingbirds ( Trochilidae ) , moths and butterflies ( Lepidoptera ) , compact flies ( Cyclorrhapha ) , and elongated flies ( Nematocera ) , which fly with marked shallower stroke amplitudes than compact flies . Since 3D aerodynamic force and wing kinematics data are not available for all these species , and most of the radiated acoustic sound is directed vertically ( Figure 3B–K ) , we simplified the model . We chose a well-studied animal for which a wingbeat-resolved vertically-oriented force component has been reported previously to act as a paradigm for each group . Respectively , the vertical force of pacific parrotlets ( Forpus coelestis Chin and Lentink , 2017 ) for generalist birds , the vertical force of Anna’s hummingbird ( Calypte anna; Ingersoll and Lentink , 2018 ) for hummingbirds , the lift force of hawkmoths ( Manduca sexta Zheng et al . , 2013 ) for moths and butterflies , the lift force of mosquitos ( Culex quinquefasciatus; Bomphrey et al . , 2017 ) for elongated flies and the net force of Drosophilid flies ( Drosophila hydei; Muijres et al . , 2014 ) for compact flies ( Supplementary file 5 ) . To simplify the comparison further , we approximate the stroke plane as horizontal and the normalized lift profile to have the same shape as the reported vertically oriented force profile , so that the lift generated during a wingbeat sums up to body weight for all associated species in the same way . To calculate the associated drag profile , we used previously reported quasi-steady lift/drag ratio data for Anna’s hummingbirds ( Ingersoll and Lentink , 2018; Kruyt et al . , 2014 ) and assume it is representative for all animals . Finally , to compute the acoustic field for each animal’s wing , we locate the lift and drag force at the third moment of area of a hummingbird wing , 55% of the wing radius ( which compares to 58% for parrotlets Chin and Lentink , 2017 ) . In our comparison , we make the exact same approximations for hummingbirds as we do for the other animals . Despite these assumptions , the simplified model matches the original model for a hummingbird well ( Figure 2—figure supplement 2 , Supplementary file 3 ) . Between each of the four groups , the instantaneous weight support , stroke amplitude , and frequency content throughout the wingbeat change based on the associated paradigm animal ( Figure 4A , B ) . In contrast , the mass , wingspan , and flapping frequency change across all individual animals in each group . Calculating the ratio of the wing length versus acoustic wavelength at the wingbeat frequency across all species , we find Rfw/ao=R/λ1≲0 . 01 ( Figure 4—figure supplement 1 ) . Indeed , synchronized acoustic and video recordings show that the measured first acoustic harmonic overlaps with the wingbeat frequency across insects ( Cator et al . , 2009; Aldersley and Cator , 2019 ) and hummingbirds ( Figure 1 ) as well as other birds and bats ( Boonman et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , similar to the hummingbird , the flapping wings of all these animals act as compact acoustic sources from the first to tenth harmonic . Furthermore , because wing length is inversely proportional to flapping frequency ( Greenewalt , 1962 ) , the assumption of acoustic compactness holds across species . Consequently , the humming sound generated across flapping animal wings can be modeled accurately with a single point force source per wing half , similar to what we found for hummingbirds ( Figure 2—figure supplement 1 ) . This even holds for mosquito buzz , the most extreme case among our five paradigm animals , because the mosquito wing’s compactness , R/λ1=0 . 006 , is equivalent to that of a hummingbird’s 0 . 007 . The weight support profiles of each of the five paradigm animals has distinct harmonic content ( Figure 4B ) . To understand how this drives acoustic power and timbre , we use our acoustic model to assign each of the five paradigm animals all five weight support profiles . For example , we variously assign the weight support profile of a mosquito , fly , hawkmoth , hummingbird , and parrotlet to our hummingbird model . This allows us to investigate the weight support profile’s effects on differences in radiated acoustic power ( Figure 4C ) and the acoustic spectrum ( Figure 4D ) . The weight support profiles of the mosquito and fly consistently generate more acoustic power and sound pressure than the other weight support profiles . Lastly , we extend the acoustic model from the five paradigm animals to 170 animals across the five groups . Body mass and flapping frequency for hummingbirds , compact flies , elongated flies , and moths and butterflies were obtained from Greenewalt , 1962 , while the values for larger birds were obtained from Pennycuick , 1990; Figure 4E , F . Comparing the model simulation results with the isometric scaling relation we derived based on the model ( Equations A25–50 ) shows that radiated acoustic power scales allometrically with body mass ( Figure 4E ) except for compact flies and moths and butterflies , which scale isometrically . Considering flapping wing parameters are known to scale allometrically with body mass , we test the scaling law itself ( Figure 4F ) , which collapses the data well on average across species ( average slope = 0 . 9; ideal slope = 1 ) , confirming the scaling law represents our model . 
 Our idealized aeroacoustic model shows the hummingbird’s hum originates from the oscillating lift and drag forces generated by their flapping wings . Remarkably , the low frequency content in the aerodynamic forces also drives higher frequency harmonics in the acoustic spectrum of the wing hum . The higher harmonics originate from nonlinear frequency mixing in the aeroacoustic pressure equation between the frequency content in the wing’s aerodynamic forces and kinematics . The predicted humming harmonics of the wingbeat frequency overlap with the measured acoustic spectrum ( averaged over all microphones ) . In addition to the good frequency match , the sound pressure level magnitudes of the first four harmonics match with a difference of 0 . 5–6 . 0 dB ( Table 1 ) . This agreement is similar or better compared to more detailed aeroacoustic models of drone and wind turbine rotors , that predict noise due to blade-wake interactions and boundary layer turbulence ( Oerlemans and Schepers , 2009; Zhang et al . , 2018; Wang et al . , 2019 ) . Further , comparing the measured and predicted spatial acoustic-pressure holograms for the top and front arrays ( reconstructed holograms at a plane 8 cm from the bird; Figure 2B ) , we find that the hologram phase , shape , and magnitude correspond throughout the stroke . The regions of high and low pressure in the hologram are associated with wing stroke reversals , similar to the pressure extrema observed at stroke reversal in computational fluid dynamics simulations of flapping insect wings ( Geng et al . , 2017; Seo et al . , 2019; Nedunchezian et al . , 2018 ) . Even though the input forces were lowpass filtered beyond the fourth harmonic , the amplitudes of higher harmonics are predicted . This is due to two distinct stages of nonlinear frequency mixing in our wing hum model: ( i ) the calculation of the resulting aerodynamic force vector generated by each flapping wing and its oscillatory trajectory in space , and ( ii ) the calculation of the resulting acoustic pressure waves ( see Supplementary Information for details ) . Our acoustic model predicts hum harmonics that lie in an intermediate frequency range between the wingbeat frequency ( ~40 Hz ) and the lower bound of feather sonations ( typically >300 Hz; Clark et al . , 2013a; Clark et al . , 2013b ) . Hence our model allows for an objective contrast between wing hum sound and other possible aerodynamic noise generation mechanisms . Indeed , we observe small tonal peaks between the prominent harmonics in Figure 2A that are not radiated by the oscillating aerodynamic forces generated by the flapping wing , according to our hum model . Consequently , these low amplitude peaks must radiate from another acoustic source such as aeroelastic feather flutter ( Clark et al . , 2011 ) or vortex dynamics ( Ellington et al . , 1996 ) . In the under-studied frequency regime of the hum , the first two harmonics are paired as they have similar sound pressure levels ( Figure 2A ) . For the hummingbird , the pairing of the first and second harmonics is due to the dominance of the pressure differential generated twice per wingbeat during the downstroke and upstroke . The associated substantial weight support during the upstroke ( Figure 1B; Ingersoll and Lentink , 2018 ) has been found across hummingbird species ( Ingersoll et al . , 2018 ) , which generalizes our findings . The sound pressure level pairing also mirrors the harmonic content in the lift and drag forces ( Figure 1C ) as well as the stroke and deviation kinematics ( Figure 1I ) . Given that the first and second harmonics dominate both the forces and kinematics spectra , the harmonic content of the resulting acoustics is a mixture of these two . The third harmonic and beyond resemble the first paired harmonic because they are associated with the noise generation mechanisms of the first two harmonics ( Rienstra and Hirschberg , 2004 ) . In concert , the first four harmonics constitute most of the acoustic radiated power of the hum timbre—the distinct sound quality that differentiates sounds from distinct types of sources even at the same pitch and volume—which is determined by the number and relative prominence of the higher harmonics present in a continuous acoustic wave ( Sethares , 2005 ) . Acoustic directivity is consistent from near to farfield , but changes based on the harmonic . In the 3D holograms , the dipole structures are associated with the high vertical forces to offset weight ( Ingersoll and Lentink , 2018 ) . These dipole orientations are not evident in the broadband holograms ( Figure 3B , C ) because slight variations between the flights are averaged and smear out the dominant dipole lobes ( individual flights for each directivity plot shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . The first and third harmonics resemble dipoles that are tilted aft . For example , for the first harmonic in the sagittal plane in both the nearfield and farfield , the dipole is tilted aft ( Figure 3D , E; Table 2 ) , which is associated with the pressure generated during the downstroke once per wingbeat . In contrast , second and fourth harmonics are more vertically oriented . The second harmonic is directed upwards in the nearfield and farfield ( Figure 3F , G; Table 2 ) and is associated with the pressure generation for the vertical weight support that occurs twice per wingbeat . The third and fourth harmonics have more complex shapes ( Figure 3H–K ) that bear resemblances to the first two because they are associated with the first two harmonics ( Rienstra and Hirschberg , 2004 ) . The acoustic model also shows these directionality effects over the first two harmonics in the sagittal and coronal near and farfield . In contrast , the simulation has more symmetry between the upstroke and downstroke , resulting in a symmetric and better-defined dipole structure . The dipoles that we measured for the first four hummingbird harmonics ( Figure 3D–K ) are strikingly similar to the ones found for hovering insects in computational fluid dynamics simulations ( Geng et al . , 2017; Seo et al . , 2019 ) . Although the mosquito dipoles are oriented more horizontally , because their wings generate unusually high drag at these harmonics ( Seo et al . , 2019 ) , due to their particularly shallow wingstroke ( Bomphrey et al . , 2017 ) . The sound magnitude that flapping wings produce depends heavily on the weight the flapping wings must support , and the timbre depends on the unique frequency content of each weight support profile ( Figure 4B ) . Flies and mosquitos are orders of magnitude lighter than our three other paradigm animals and produce less acoustic power accordingly ( Figure 4C ) . Yet the fly and mosquito weight support profiles have the highest harmonic content ( Figure 4B ) and therefore , when all else is equal , consistently radiate the most power ( Figure 4C ) . In contrast , the parrotlet weight support profile has the lowest harmonic content ( Figure 4B ) ; with most of the force being generated once per wingbeat during the downstroke , hence it radiates the least power when all else is equal ( Figure 4C ) . For hummingbirds and hawkmoths , the proportion of weight support in upstroke versus downstroke is similar ( Geng et al . , 2017; Ingersoll and Lentink , 2018 ) ; this gives them roughly similar vertical force profiles and leads to similar acoustic power ( Figure 4C ) . The effect of altering the weight support profile is also visible in the acoustic spectrum . At the scale of a hummingbird ( Figure 4C , inset ) , the prescribed weight support profiles distinguish the distribution of the overall decibel level for the first four harmonics ( Figure 4D ) . This explains why flies and mosquitos may seem loud relative to their small size: while they have little mass , it is partially offset by the high harmonics in their weight support profiles . Furthermore , it is the higher harmonics present in the weight support profile that directly affect the perceived quality of the sound—the timbre . Body mass is a strong predictor of radiated acoustic power because the aerodynamic forces needed to sustain slow hovering flight must be proportionally larger for heavier animals ( Weis-Fogh , 1973; Altshuler et al . , 2010; Skandalis et al . , 2017 ) . The associated increase in aerodynamic force amplitude drives acoustic pressure ( Equation 1 ) . The resulting radiated acoustic power , P , scales with the square of the acoustic pressure , p ( Equation A25 ) . Increasing flapping frequency also increases the radiated acoustic power; flapping faster requires more power from the animal and injects more acoustic energy into the air . Applying scaling analysis to Equation 1 ( derived in Supplementary Information; Equations A25–50 ) , we can predict the order of magnitude of the radiated acoustic power in the farfield ( Howe , 2014 ) : ( 2 ) Po=4Fo2Φo2fw2πρoao3≈2 . 5⋅10−6Φo2m2fw2 , where the subscript 'o' corresponds to the reference value and F0=mg is the aerodynamic force magnitude required to maintain hover . The resulting acoustic power law scales with the product of wing stroke amplitude , Φo , body mass , m , and wingbeat frequency , fw , squared . Further , since Φo is dimensionless , it has order of magnitude one , measured in radians , across flapping birds ( Nudds et al . , 2004 ) and insects ( Azuma , 2006 ) . The remaining terms , 4/π , the gravitational constant g=9 . 81ms−2 , the air density ρo≈1 . 23kgm−3 , and speed of sound in air , ao≈343ms−1 are constants that determine the factor 2 . 5×10−6 kg−1s−1 between the radiated acoustic power and its scaling variables . When acoustic power is plotted as a function of mass ( Figure 4E ) , the predicted exponent of 2 . 0 is higher than the observed average exponent of 1 . 3 . Among the five groups , compact flies and moths and butterflies do match the scaling law prediction , showing their acoustic power scales isometrically with body mass . The other groups scale allometrically with either higher , elongated flies , or lower , hummingbirds and other birds , exponents of body mass . Allometric divergence can more readily explain why larger hummingbirds are quieter , because they have disproportionally larger wings combined with an approximately constant wing velocity across an order of magnitude variation in body mass , which is thought to maintain constant burst flight capacity ( Skandalis et al . , 2017 ) . Conversely , for insects , the gracile bodies and larger wings of moths and butterflies are offset by the higher flapping frequency of compact flies . Therefore , flies use asynchronous flight muscles to achieve these high flapping frequencies ( Deakin , 1970 ) . Large , elongated flies are unusually noisy for their body mass , with radiated acoustic power values well above the average scaling law ( Figure 4E ) . The disproportional noise generated by elongated flies is due to two combined effects: the higher harmonic content of their weight support profile ( Figure 4A , B ) and their consistent allometric acoustic power scaling ( Figure 4E ) . The difference between the scaling exponents for mass is primarily due to allometric scaling of wingbeat frequency with body mass because the simulated acoustic power scales with the right-hand side of scaling Equation 2 with an exponent of 0 . 9 ( on average ) , close to 1 ( Figure 4F ) . Scaling Equation 2 is precise for birds , compact flies , and moths and butterflies , but the two other groups scale allometrically: larger birds get more silent ( slope = 0 . 9 ) while elongated flies ( 1 . 1 ) get louder than predicted by isometric scaling incorporating the allometric body mass and wing frequency relationship . The deviation may be partially explained by variation in wing stroke amplitude ( Bomphrey et al . , 2017; Nudds et al . , 2004; Azuma , 2006 ) . Further , body size and wingspan in insects are highly variable amongst individuals of even the same species ( Debat et al . , 2003 ) , which may explain the larger variation . Finally , the assumptions underpinning our scaling analysis may explain some deviation . The extension of our simple model to predict flapping wing hum across a wide range of species ( Figure 4 ) makes it a useful tool to study insects , birds , and bats performing a variety of complex behaviors . Like the acoustic power scaling law ( Equation 2 ) , Equation 1 can be simplified further ( Figure 4—figure supplements 1 , 2 ) for comparative biomechanical and neuroethological studies: ( 3 ) p=14π|r|3 ( r⋅Fwing ) ⏟nearfield+14πao|r|2 ( r⋅∂Fwing∂t+4ΦoRfw2ao ( r⋅Fwing ) ) ⏟farfield . Our study shows how this model can elucidate the mechanistic origin of wing hum timbre ( and modulation ) in vivo by integrating acoustic recordings with high-speed videography and aerodynamic force recordings . Likewise , we showed it can be used to make predictions or interpret acoustic measurements by integrating a simplified wing kinematics and aerodynamic force model . It can also be used to estimate the auditory detection distance of wing hum by combining it with an audiogram . Finally , the ability to distinguish between the nearfield versus farfield provides an additional lens for behavioral inquiry . The predicted range over which wing hum can be perceived is even larger in rock pigeons; approximately four meters or ~12 wing radii ( Columba livia: flapping frequency 7 Hz , mass 400 g , wing length 32 cm; Pennycuick , 1968 ) . The perception distance scales up with body mass ( Figure 4E ) and the auditory threshold of pigeons is exquisitely sensitive to the wingbeat frequency ( Kreithen and Quine , 1979 ) , which can thus potentially inform flocking behavior ( Larsson , 2012 ) . Conversely , while the low-frequency oscillating aerodynamic forces also radiate high-frequency humming harmonics up to the tenth wingbeat harmonic ( Figure 2A , Table 1 ) and beyond , the corresponding decibel amplitudes are insignificant compared to harmonics close to the wingbeat frequency ( Figure 1F ) . This helps explain why some birds rely on specialized flight feathers that sonate loudly at high frequency to signal over longer distances how they are flapping their wings during flock takeoff ( Hingee and Magrath , 2009; Niese and Tobalske , 2016; Murray et al . , 2017 ) , mating displays ( Clark et al . , 2016 ) and displays to defend courting territories ( Miller and Inouye , 1983 ) . Perception of wing whoosh also has implications for bird-insect predation , because moths have been shown to respond to the wingbeat hum of birds in playback experiments ( Fournier et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , an acoustic model analogous to the one we present here has recently been used to simulate mosquito buzz ( Seo et al . , 2019 ) in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics to predict how aerodynamic forces ( Bomphrey et al . , 2017 ) color the mosquito’s aerial courtship song ( Cator et al . , 2009 ) . Intriguingly , whereas mosquitos fly with a shallow wing stroke to generate high harmonic content , fruit flies do not ( Bomphrey et al . , 2017 ) . When fruit flies use their wing as an aeroacoustic instrument during terrestrial courtship serenades; however , they reduce their stroke amplitude to a similar degree ( von Schilcher , 1976; Bennet-Clark and Ewing , 1968 ) , which likely colors their timbre as in mosquitos ( Figure 4A–D ) . Our acoustic model explains how the oscillating lift and drag forces generated by each wing of a hovering hummingbird radiate the distinctive humming timbre . It integrates in vivo 3D aerodynamic force and wing kinematics measurements and is corroborated spatially and temporally through in vivo nearfield acoustic holography . The measurements and model show that hovering hummingbirds generate a highly directional hum . The broadband acoustic pressure is primarily oriented downward opposing gravity , while the acoustic directivity and orientation of the harmonic components depend on harmonic parity . The model explains how perceived differences in hum loudness and timbre across birds and insects stem primarily from the harmonic content in the aerodynamic weight support profile . Higher harmonic content throughout the wing stroke makes flies and mosquitos buzz , equivalent first and second harmonic content makes hummingbirds hum , while dominant first harmonic content gives birds their softer whoosh . The associated scaling relation for radiated acoustic power shows how it is proportional to the product of stroke amplitude , body mass and wingbeat frequency squared . Our scaling analysis across 170 different animals in slow hovering flight reveals how the radiated acoustic power scaled with mass . Allometric deviation explains why larger birds radiate less acoustic power than expected and why elongated flies have a remarkably loud buzz as perceived by a casual observer . Finally , our acoustic model and scaling equation can help neuroethologists and bioacousticians interpret the loudness and timbre of the hum generated by flapping winged animals performing complex behaviors as well as guide bioinspired engineers how to design more silent flapping robots ( Wood , 2008; Keennon et al . , 2012 ) . 
 The 3D aerodynamic force platform flight arena consisted of a 0 . 5 × 0 . 5 × 0 . 5 m ( height , width , depth ) chamber , where each of the six sides is an instrumented carbon fiber force plate that mechanically integrates pressure and shear forces generated by the freely flying hummingbird ( Ingersoll and Lentink , 2018; Lentink et al . , 2015; Hightower et al . , 2017 ) . Three high-speed stereo cameras captured the wingbeat kinematics through three orthogonal imaging windows in the plates . Each plate is statically determined and attached to three vee blocks ( VB-375-SM , Bal-tec ) , each instrumented by a Nano 43 6-axis force/torque sensor ( 4000 Hz sampling rate , lowpass filtered with an eighth order digital lowpass Butterworth filter at 180 Hz , silicon strain gage based , with SI-9–0 . 125 calibration , 2 mN resolution , ATI Industrial Automation ) . There are also two force sensors instrumenting a beam attached to the artificial flower to measure hummingbird contact forces and body weight . For detailed analysis , we selected 3D force traces over five consecutive wingbeats per flight ( N = 6 birds , each bird did two flights , n = 5 wingbeats per flight for 60 wingbeats total ) for which we manually tracked the 3D wing kinematics of four points on the bird ( right shoulder , distal end of the leading-edge covert , wingtip , and tip of the fifth primary feather ) . We recorded wingbeat kinematics through three orthogonal acrylic access ports using stereo high-speed videography at 2000 Hz using three pairs of DLT calibrated ( Hedrick , 2008 ) cameras ( four Phantom Micro M310s , one R-311 , and one LC310; Vision Research ) . We filtered the kinematics with a fourth order digital lowpass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 400 Hz ( ~10 times the wingbeat frequency ) . The acoustic setup consisted of a chamber that is 0 . 3 × 0 . 9 ×0 . 9 m ( height , width , depth ) . The sides of the chamber were made of IR transparent acrylic ( Plexiglass 3143 ) to allow visual access into the chamber while controlling what the hummingbird views from inside the chamber . Two battery-powered LED lights ( Neewer CN126 ) sustained a constant light level of 3000 lux at the flower . Combined , the arrays surrounded the hummingbird with 2176 microphones ( of which 25 ± 7 were disabled during each measurement; see Supplementary Information for details ) while it freely hovered in front of a flower to feed . The top and bottom arrays ( Sorama CAM1Ks ) each consist of 1024 microelectromechanical ( MEMS ) microphones , while the two frontal arrays ( Sorama CAM64s ) feature 64 microphones each with a sampling frequency of 46 , 875 Hz . During the actual flight , these arrays were covered by an acoustically transparent cloth ( Acoustone speaker grille cloth ) to protect both the bird and the microphones . To limit wall effects encountered in flight arenas ( Hightower et al . , 2017 ) , the feeder was centered 15 cm horizontally from the edge and 15 cm above the bottom array . The sides of the acoustic arena featured optically accessible panels in the infrared range , which were used to film the hummingbirds with four direct linear transformation calibrated high-speed infrared cameras at 500 fps . The 3D pressure field was reconstructed from the planar array measurements using broadband nearfield acoustic holography ( NAH ) . Each frequency component of the holograms was regularized independently using a Bayesian evidence method ( Wijnings , 2015 ) before adding them all together to create the broadband NAH results . To reduce distortions due to frequency leakage , linear predictive border padding ( Scholte , 2008; van Dalen et al . , 2012 ) was applied to the time signals . The radial directivity was computed using spherical NAH ( Williams , 1999 ) .","['Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Results', 'Discussion', 'Materials and methods']",['evolutionary biology'],elife-63107-v2,61,8689,8628,142.44262295081967

The instructions to make this complexity are stored within the genes of living cells . For many genes , this process involves two steps . First , the cells copy , or transcribe , the information in the gene – which is part of a DNA molecule – into a more portable but shorter-lived molecule called RNA . The RNA can then be transported to other parts of a cell where its information is decoded to make a protein . Proteins are like molecular machines and making proteins is how many genes contribute to keeping life going . RNA molecules can fold into intricate shapes including structures called riboswitches . These are parts of an RNA molecule that can control how and when the RNA is used to make proteins . Riboswitches detect the presence of other chemicals inside a cell and respond by changing their shape . Binding to the right molecule will move a riboswitch from an “off” to an “on” position , or vice versa . Riboswitches can help to ensure that some proteins are only made when they are needed . For example , a protein that helps to make a certain chemical is only produced when that chemical is in short supply . Sherlock et al . have now studied riboswitches in a species of bacteria called Facklamia ignava . The investigation revealed a new riboswitch structure that detects phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate , or PRPP , which is a building block for RNA and , eventually , DNA molecules . Further examination revealed that these riboswitches are often linked to others that detect guanine molecules – another component of RNA and DNA . This double riboswitch is similar to a logic gate in computing , activating or shutting down protein production in response to changes in the concentrations of both PRPP and guanine . The findings of Sherlock et al . reveal a system where RNA controls its own production in response to the availability of two of its critical building blocks . This entirely RNA-dependent system adds weight to the so-called ‘RNA world’ hypothesis which suggests that the earliest forms of life on Earth depended solely on RNA . Molecules of RNA are able to store data like DNA while also behaving as molecular machines like proteins . This potentially helps to explain how the first life could have arisen from simple , non-living chemicals . Riboswitch systems like this are likely to be relics of this ancient time . Also , because they are involved in fundamental processes in living bacteria , riboswitch systems also provide potentially interesting targets for new antibiotics .","Gene control systems sometimes interpret multiple signals to set the expression levels of the genes they regulate . In rare instances , ligand-binding riboswitch aptamers form tandem arrangements to approximate the function of specific two-input Boolean logic gates . Here , we report the discovery of riboswitch aptamers for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( PRPP ) that naturally exist either in singlet arrangements , or occur in tandem with guanine aptamers . Tandem guanine-PRPP aptamers can bind the target ligands , either independently or in combination , to approximate the function expected for an IMPLY Boolean logic gate to regulate transcription of messenger RNAs for de novo purine biosynthesis in bacteria . The existence of sophisticated all-RNA regulatory systems that sense two ancient ribonucleotide derivatives to control synthesis of RNA molecules supports the hypothesis that RNA World organisms could have managed a complex metabolic state without the assistance of protein regulatory factors . 
 A variety of riboswitch classes regulate gene expression in response to the binding of specific metabolite or inorganic ion ligands ( Roth and Breaker , 2009; Serganov and Nudler , 2013; Sherwood and Henkin , 2016 ) . Previously , 25 riboswitch classes were known that selectively respond to ligands that are chemical derivatives of RNA monomers or their precursors ( McCown et al . , 2017 ) . This strong bias in favor of RNA-like ligands strengthens the hypothesis ( Nelson and Breaker , 2017; Breaker , 2010 ) that many of the widely-distributed riboswitch classes are direct descendants from the RNA World – a time before genetically-encoded protein biosynthesis ( Gilbert , 1986; Benner et al . , 1989 ) . If this speculation is generally correct , we can expect that some of the most abundant riboswitch classes remaining to be discovered also will regulate gene expression in response to the binding of other ancient RNA derivatives ( Breaker , 2011 ) . With these considerations in mind , we evaluated the possible functions of variants of recently validated riboswitches for guanidine ( Nelson et al . , 2017 ) . Collectively , guanidine-I riboswitches along with differently-functioning variants were originally called the ykkC orphan riboswitch candidate because no ligand had been identified ( Barrick et al . , 2004; Meyer et al . , 2011 ) . After removing guanidine-I riboswitches ( subtype 1 ) , which constituted ~70% of the original ykkC motif RNAs , we further separated the remaining collection of ykkC RNA variants ( subtype 2 ) . Upon further investigation of the RNA sequences , the phylogeny of organisms containing these RNAs , and the genes associated with each instance of the RNA , we concluded that ykkC subtype 2 RNAs were populated by multiple riboswitch classes that sensed distinct ligands . Subtype 2 representatives were sorted according to the gene located immediately downstream from the ykkC RNA motif to create revised consensus models for the RNAs within each gene association group . In some cases , additional conserved nucleotides were observed immediately 5´ and 3´ of the three hairpin structures ( called P1 , P2 and P3 ) that are characteristic of ykkC motif RNAs . This region located downstream of the guanidine binding site of subtype 1 RNAs were found to be unnecessary for guanidine-I riboswitches . In total , these distinct representatives were sorted into four candidate riboswitch classes called subtypes 2a through 2d . All subtype 2 RNAs appear to be extremely similar because they share many of the same highly-conserved nucleotides and secondary structure features . We were fortunate to have high-resolution crystal structures ( Reiss et al . , 2017; Battaglia et al . , 2017 ) of the guanidine-I riboswitch ( subtype 1 , Figure 1A ) in hand when evaluating each of these variant subtypes . Nearly all highly-conserved nucleotides shared by ykkC RNAs are involved in forming tertiary contacts within the larger folded structure that positions other nucleotides to form the ligand-binding pocket . However , nucleotides that change identity and are characteristic of each subtype are almost exclusively found in close proximity to the known binding pocket of guanidine-I riboswitches ( indicated by black asterisks in Figure 1A ) . For subtypes 2a , 2b , and 2c , we speculated that the additional stretches of conserved nucleotides preceding the P1 stem and following the P3 stem likely play a role in ligand recognition , or perhaps provide structural support for an expanded binding pocket . Unfortunately , because these nucleotides are not conserved in guanidine-I riboswitches , we do not currently have a good understanding of their 3D positioning relative to the rest of the aptamer . It quickly became clear that sequences associated with branched-chain amino acid metabolism appeared highly similar to those associated with glutamate synthases and natA transporters , and so these were collectively termed ykkC subtype 2a ( Figure 1A ) . Shortly thereafter , these were experimentally verified as a riboswitch class that responds to the bacterial alarmone ppGpp ( ME Sherlock , N Sudarsan , RR Breaker , manuscript submitted ) . Herein , we describe the function of ykkC subtype 2b RNAs ( Figure 1A , B ) , whereas the ligands for subtype 2c and 2d RNAs have not yet been identified ( see discussion ) . Three major clues were exploited to identify phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( PRPP; 5-phospho-α-D-ribose 1-diphosphate ) ( Figure 1B ) as the ligand for riboswitches represented by ykkC subtype 2b RNAs . First , representatives of this riboswitch class commonly associate with genes for de novo purine biosynthesis ( Figure 1C ) . In addition , cytosine deaminase ( codA ) , a gene involved in pyrimidine salvage that is known to be repressed by the purine guanine ( Kilstrup et al . , 1989 ) , is also commonly located downstream of subtype 2b RNAs . These associated genes , which are either related to the production of purines or are regulated by a purine , suggested to us that the ligand would most likely be a compound related to purine metabolism . Second , there are 257 examples of ykkC subtype 2b RNAs distributed throughout bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes . Of these , 127 examples occur in a tandem arrangement ( Sudarsan et al . , 2006 ) with a guanine aptamer ( Mandal et al . , 2003 ) located directly upstream ( Figure 1B ) . Such tandem arrangements are likely to function in concert as two-input molecular logic gates ( ; Stoddard and Batey , 2006; Lee et al . , 2010 ) . Guanine riboswitches typically turn off expression of downstream purine biosynthesis genes when sufficient guanine is present ( Mandal et al . , 2003 ) , while representatives of ykkC subtype 2b riboswitches were predicted to turn on expression of downstream genes . The physical arrangement of each aptamer in the tandem arrangement suggests that they share a single expression platform . Guanine binding to its aptamer likely would promote the formation of an adjoining intrinsic transcription terminator stem , which would halt transcription . In opposition , binding of ligand to the adjacent subtype 2b RNA would preclude terminator stem formation and thereby override the typical function of the guanine riboswitch . If this speculation is correct , then the ligand for subtype 2b RNAs should trigger cells to make more purines even when one of the major purine compounds , guanine , is plentiful . Third , we noticed that the consensus sequence and structural models for ppGpp riboswitch aptamers ( subtype 2a ) and subtype 2b RNAs are remarkably alike , including many similarities at the ligand binding site , suggesting that their ligands might also share some chemical features . Particularly notable was the observation that a long-range C-G base-pair present in guanidine-I riboswitches ( Reiss et al . , 2017; Battaglia et al . , 2017 ) is absent in ppGpp riboswitches , but appears to again be present in subtype 2b RNAs . We speculated that the structural role of the G nucleotide missing in ppGpp aptamers might be performed by the guanine base of the ligand . However , because the highly-similar subtype 2b RNA retains this G nucleotide ( indicated by a red asterisk in Figure 1A ) in its aptamer , its ligand might resemble an apurinic version of ppGpp . 
 To evaluate PRPP binding and riboswitch aptamer function , we examined a 106 nucleotide singlet aptamer arbitrarily derived from the purC gene of the bacterium Facklamia ignava ( Figure 2A ) by using in-line probing ( Soukup and Breaker , 1999; Regulski and Breaker , 2008 ) . This method takes advantage of the inherent chemical instability of phosphodiester linkages in unstructured regions of an RNA and the folding differences in aptamers brought about by ligand binding to provide details on riboswitch function . The 106 purC RNA construct exhibits structural modulation at highly conserved nucleotide positions upon the addition of PRPP ( Figure 2B ) . In contrast , no structural modulation of the RNA is observed when the known ligands for the other ykkC subtypes ( guanidine and ppGpp ) or for the guanine riboswitch ( guanine ) are added . Importantly , the structural changes selectively brought about by PRPP largely occur in regions equivalent to those previously implicated in ligand binding by guanidine-I ( Nelson et al . , 2017; Reiss et al . , 2017; Battaglia et al . , 2017 ) and ppGpp riboswitch classes . This observation strongly suggests that these binding site nucleotides have changed to alter ligand specificity , and that PRPP is recognized by this converted binding pocket . Due to the well-characterized instability of the PRPP molecule ( Dennis et al . , 2000; Meola et al . , 2003 ) , especially under alkaline conditions and high Mg2+ , PRPP extensively degrades into multiple breakdown products over the course of our binding experiments . As a result , in-line probing assays will not yield accurate dissociation constants . Therefore , to evaluate the effects of PRPP on riboswitch function , we performed single-turnover in vitro transcription termination experiments ( Wickiser et al . , 2005a ) , which involve briefer incubations under milder conditions . The P3 helix of the PRPP aptamer ( Figure 1A ) is predicted to act as an antiterminator stem , which should increase the number of full-length mRNA transcripts when PRPP is bound . Transcription of a singlet PRPP riboswitch derived from the purB gene of Heliobacterium modesticaldum ( Figure 3A ) produces a greater yield of full-length RNA when PRPP is added to the reaction ( Figure 3B ) . The concentration of PRPP necessary to achieve half maximal termination ( T50 ) is less than 100 µM ( Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . In contrast , an RNA construct ( M1 ) with disruptive mutations within the highly-conserved aptamer sequence yields the same fraction of terminated and full-length transcripts regardless of PRPP concentration ( Figure 3B ) . Importantly , T50 values should not be considered equivalent to KD values . Riboswitches evaluated by transcription termination assays operate under kinetic limitations , whereas KD values established by in-line probing can reach thermodynamic equilibrium ( Wickiser et al . , 2005a; Wickiser et al . , 2005b; Gilbert et al . , 2006; Rieder et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , the KD for PRPP binding to the H . modesticaldum aptamer is likely to be far better than the T50 values we measured for the H . modesticaldum purB construct , which range between 40 and 90 µM ( Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 ) . The same singlet PRPP riboswitch sequence from H . modesticaldum ( Figure 3A ) was fused to lacZ in wild-type ( WT ) and ΔpurF Bacillus subtilis cells . Deletion of the purF gene , which encodes the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step of de novo purine biosynthesis ( Figure 1C ) , causes PRPP to accumulate when cells are starved for purines . Accordingly , the lacZ gene is expressed ( blue ) in glucose minimal medium in the ΔpurF strain , but not ( clear ) in the parental B . subtilis strain with a functional purF gene ( Figure 3D ) . Notably , the cells range from completely clearto a robust blue under these two conditions , indicating that gene expression is fully suppressed when no ligand is present . Thus , the riboswitch appears to sample a much greater dynamic range for gene expression in vivo than is observed with in vitro transcription termination assays . A riboswitch-reporter fusion carrying a mutation ( M2 ) in the terminator stem expresses lacZ under both conditions . These results demonstrate that PRPP accumulation in cells induce gene expression , which parallels our findings in vitro that PRPP binding by ykkC subtype 2b RNAs promotes transcription elongation ( Figure 3B and Figure 3C ) . We next sought to characterize the tandem arrangement of the guanine and PRPP aptamers by in-line probing analysis of the 208 nucleotide RNA derived from the codA gene of Bacillus megaterium ( Figure 4A ) . Each aptamer appears to independently fold to form its characteristic structure and each exhibits typical structural modulation ( Figure 4B ) upon addition of its cognate ligand as previously observed for singlet guanine ( Mandal et al . , 2003 ) or PRPP ( Figure 2B ) aptamers . Only the aptamer regions of the RNA were examined by these in-line probing experiments , but the logic gate function of the tandem riboswitch is accomplished through interactions between the two aptamers and the adjoining expression platform . Consequently , terminator and antiterminator stems are stabilized or destabilized depending on the relative concentrations of both guanine and PRPP . The precise mechanism by which the guanine and PRPP aptamers work in opposition to control the formation of the terminator stem has yet to be fully experimentally evaluated . However , bioinformatic and in-line probing data already might provide clues regarding the structural interplay between the two aptamers . First , guanine aptamers are always located almost immediately adjacent to the conserved nucleotides at the 5´ terminus of the PRPP aptamer in tandem arrangements ( Figure 1B ) . Specifically , there are typically only 5 to 7 nucleotides separating the P1 stems of the guanine and PRPP aptamers , suggesting this juxtaposition is important for logic gate function . Second , the addition of PRPP to the tandem construct causes a reduction in spontaneous RNA cleavage within the conserved nucleotides at the 5´ terminus of the PRPP aptamer ( Figure 4B , region 5 ) , whereas guanine addition causes this same region to experience a dramatic increase in scission . These results suggest that guanine binding to its aptamer destabilizes an important structural feature necessary for ligand binding by the PRPP aptamer . Thus , each aptamer might interfere with its neighboring aptamer upon ligand binding , perhaps by causing steric clashes due to their proximity . Additional experiments will need to be conducted to more fully evaluate this mechanistic hypothesis . To evaluate the proposed two-input logic gate function , the same guanine-PRPP tandem aptamer system including its associated expression platform from B . megaterium ( Figure 5A ) was subjected to in vitro transcription termination assays . Consistent with results from the singlet aptamer , the addition of PRPP increases the fraction of RNA transcripts that pass beyond the intrinsic terminator stem and reach full length ( Figure 5B ) . Also as predicted , the addition of guanine causes an increase in the fraction of terminated transcripts . When both guanine and PRPP are at high levels , the predicted genetic override occurs , and the fraction of terminated products approaches zero . Separate and simultaneous mutations to each aptamer ( constructs M3 through M5 ) confirm the OFF and ON function of the guanine and PRPP aptamers , respectively . Specifically , the mutations in M3 alter two highly-conserved nucleotides in the core of the guanine aptamer that are known to be essential for forming its ligand-binding core ( Batey et al . , 2004; Serganov et al . , 2004 ) . As expected , the addition of guanine does not increase transcription termination . Similarly , the mutations in M4 alter two highly-conserved nucleotides in PRPP aptamer , which we expect to disrupt PRPP binding . Again as expected , the amount of transcription termination product increases , and PRPP addition has no effect on the distribution of transcription products . Construct M5 combines the M3 and M4 mutations to generate an RNA that should fail to bind either ligand . Indeed , the M5 construct appears to be unaffected by the addition of either guanine or PRPP ( Figure 5B ) . Similar results are observed in vivo when the WT and M3 through M5 tandem guanine-PRPP riboswitch constructs from B . megaterium were fused to the lacZ reporter gene and transformed into WT B . subtilis cells ( Figure 5C ) . The versatility of this tandem riboswitch system is best demonstrated by varying the concentrations of both guanine and PRPP in a series of in vitro transcription termination assays . The data from these reactions yields a 3D landscape demonstrating again that the relative concentrations of guanine and PRPP dictate the fraction of RNA transcripts that reach full length ( Figure 5D ) . Thus , the tandem riboswitch arrangement permits cells to tune the expression levels of associated genes based on the relative concentrations of guanine and PRPP , such that high PRPP levels promote purine production despite the abundance of guanine , a prominent purine . At the single molecule level , each riboswitch aptamer in this tandem construct favors either transcription termination or elongation based on the binding of its cognate ligand . In this regard , each RNA molecule carrying this tandem aptamer arrangement functions as a Boolean IMPLY logic gate . The truth table for an IMPLY logic gate ( Figure 6A ) indicates that gene expression should be on when neither ligand is present , and when PRPP is bound by the RNA – even when guanine is available . Finally , gene expression should be off when guanine is bound by the RNA , which should occur when guanine is abundant while PRPP is not . This regulatory pattern could be accomplished by the tandem RNA arrangement through formation of an antiterminator stem by alternative base pairing interactions between the two aptamers , similar to those observed for an allosterically-regulated tandem riboswitch-ribozyme described previously ( Lee et al . , 2010; Chen et al . , 2011 ) . Alternatively , as noted earlier , the aptamers might compete sterically due to the proximity of their conserved sequences and structures . Regardless of the precise mechanism , we hypothesize that an unoccupied PRPP aptamer permits formation of the terminator stem , whereas an occupied guanine aptamer destabilizes the PRPP aptamer . Additional detailed kinetic and structural studies will be necessary to reveal the precise molecular interactions that yield IMPLY gene control logic . When transcription termination or gene expression is observed as the average output from a population of RNA constructs , the resulting data do not represent a perfect Boolean function because the output yields intermediate values between zero and maximal values . Whereas each of the individual RNAs operates as a binary logic gate that is either on or off , a population of these RNAs exceeds the function of an individual Boolean logic gate . Together , the output of the tandem riboswitch population functions more like a molecular rheostat to tune gene expression based on relative ligand concentrations , rather than as an all-or-nothing binary switch . Regardless , when ligand concentrations are at their extreme values , the output of the tandem system ( Figure 5D ) approaches the binary logic of an IMPLY gate . A situation in cells in which both guanine and PRPP are scarce would indicate an extremely starved state . Ordinarily , one might expect guanine and PRPP levels to be negatively correlated , such that an excess of guanine would deplete PRPP as a result of the synthesis of 5′-guanosine monophosphate , and vice versa , either through de novo purine biosynthesis or the purine salvage pathway ( Figure 1B ) . If true , then why is it necessary to form this complex tandem arrangement to override the gene control function of a guanine riboswitch ? This apparent regulatory paradox is addressed in more detail below . During the stringent response in Firmicutes , nutrient starvation is signaled by the presence of uncharged tRNAs that activate the ppGpp synthase RelA ( Geiger and Wolz , 2014 ) . ppGpp synthesis causes GTP levels to drop and the transcriptional repressor CodY , which requires GTP and isoleucine to bind its target sites , to release and enable transcription of branched-chain amino acid ( BCAA ) biosynthesis genes ( Sonenshein , 2005 ) . The resulting increased ppGpp concentration promotes binding of this signaling molecule as an inhibitor of enzymes such as GuaB , GMK , and HprT ( Figure 1C ) to suppress GTP production ( Kriel et al . , 2012 ) , causing both guanine and PRPP to accumulate . Under these conditions the guanine-PRPP tandem riboswitch still turns on expression of its downstream genes , despite the mechanisms in place to keep GTP levels low . At first this appears counterintuitive , but the genes associated with the tandem riboswitch system only include those for catalyzing the steps of de novo purine synthesis up to the production of inosine monophosphate ( IMP ) , the branch point between AMP and GMP production ( Figure 1C ) . Thus , the riboswitch promotes AMP synthesis , but will not turn on genes specific for GDP or GTP synthesis that are already being inhibited by ppGpp . ATP is known to be present in elevated quantities during the stringent response because it is used as the initiating nucleotide for transcription of genes under the ppGpp superregulon , whereas rRNA transcripts utilize GTP as the initiating nucleotide to suppress protein production ( Krásný et al . , 2008 ) . As noted above , the guanine-PRPP tandem riboswitch arrangement at its functional limits most closely approximates an IMPLY logic gate ( Figure 6A ) . This all-RNA system joins the NOR gate formed by tandem S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) and adenosylcobalamin ( AdoCbl or coenzyme B12 ) riboswitches ( Sudarsan et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 6B ) and the AND gate formed by tandem T box and ppGpp riboswitch RNAs ( Figure 6C ) as sophisticated regulatory RNAs that approximate Boolean logic functions . Similarly , the tandem riboswitch-ribozyme arrangement formed by a c-di-GMP-II riboswitch and a group I self-splicing ribozyme senses both c-di-GMP and guanosine ( or any of its 5´-phosphorylated derivatives ) to approximate the function of a Boolean AND gate ( Lee et al . , 2010; Chen et al . , 2011 ) . In this example , one chemical input is sensed by a conventional riboswitch aptamer , whereas the second chemical input is sensed by the active site of a ribozyme . These more complex riboswitch and ribozyme arrangements are notable because they demonstrate how sensory and regulatory systems comprised entirely of RNA can perform sophisticated decision-making in modern cells . 
 Most experimentally validated riboswitch classes sense and respond to ligands originating from RNA metabolism pathways , and therefore it seemed reasonable to consider the likelihood that riboswitches for PRPP would exist . PRPP is an essential precursor for the modern biosynthesis of RNA monomers in organisms from all three domains of life , and is likely to have been important for the production of ribonucleotides very early in evolution . If PRPP was used by RNA World organisms to generate the building blocks of this major biopolymer , then RNA aptamers that selectively bound this biosynthetic precursor in ancient times might have persisted to serve as riboswitch aptamers in modern cells . Intriguingly , we had representatives of PRPP riboswitches on our list of riboswitch candidates over a decade ago ( Barrick et al . , 2004 ) , but due to their striking similarity to riboswitches for guanidine ( Nelson et al . , 2017 ) and ppGpp , they were unusually difficult to identify and experimentally validate . Members of other riboswitch classes have previously been found to exhibit altered ligand specificities by accruing key mutations in nucleotides of their binding pockets . For example , guanine riboswitches have undergone one or a few key mutations to change their ligand specificity to adenine ( Mandal and Breaker , 2004 ) or 2´-deoxyguanosine ( Kim et al . , 2007; Weinberg et al . , 2017 ) . Also , subtle binding site variants of FMN riboswitches appear to bind a closely related ligand ( https://patentscope . wipo . int/search/en/detail . jsf ? docId=WO2011097027&recNum=27&docAn=US2011000204&queryString= ( riboswitch ) %2520&maxRec=179; Weinberg et al . , 2017 ) , and riboswitches for molybdenum cofactor ( MoCo ) are proposed to have modest binding site changes to alter their ligand specificity to bind tungsten cofactor ( Regulski et al . , 2008 ) . In nearly all these previous examples , there are relatively small changes in the chemical structure of the ligand that need to be accommodated by the riboswitch binding pocket changes . For the subtypes of ykkC motif RNAs whose ligands have been identified , the chemical differences in the ligands can be substantial . The ppGpp ( subtype 2a ) and PRPP ( subtype 2b ) riboswitch ligands differ by the presence or absence of a guanine nucleobase and by the location and number of phosphate moieties . Guanidinium , the ligand for guanidine-I ( subtype 1 ) riboswitches is entirely distinct from PRPP , and this moiety forms only a portion of the purine ring of ppGpp . The ligands sensed by subtypes 2 c and 2d , which are associated with genes encoding nucleoside diphosphate linked to X ( NUDIX ) hydrolases of unknown specificity and a transporter of unknown function associated with phosphonate utilization ( phn_DUF6 ) , respectively , still remain to be discovered . The consensus models of ykkC subtype 2c and 2d RNAs each have more prominent changes compared to subtype 2a versus 2b at nucleotide positions that are known to be involved in ligand recognition ( Nelson et al . , 2017; Reiss et al . , 2017; Battaglia et al . , 2017 ) . Because the consensus model for subtype 2c RNAs has the most similarity to those for PRPP and ppGpp riboswitches , and the associated genes encode enzymes with various nucleotide substrates , we speculate that this candidate riboswitch class senses another nucleotide derivative . The consensus model for subtype 2d RNAs has the most similarity to that for guanidine-I riboswitches and the phn_DUF6 transporter proteins whose expression they control fall into the same drug/metabolite transporter superfamily as guanidine transporters . Therefore , we propose that this unsolved candidate riboswitch class might sense a small , charged , toxic compound akin to guanidine . It will be interesting to compare the chemical structures of all of the ykkC family riboswitch ligands once those for the subtype 2c and 2d riboswitch candidates have been validated . Nonetheless , the collection of ykkC motif RNAs already demonstrates the ability of RNA to recognize a variety of distinct small molecules , all while utilizing the same general structural scaffold . Furthermore , the discovery of tandem guanine-PRPP riboswitches serve as additional demonstrations of how complex molecular devices can be formed purely from RNA . We should note here that the in vitro transcription data for the logic gate molecules ( Figure 5B , C ) represent the combined output of a population of RNA transcripts . Although the transcript length trends are as predicted for an IMPLY gate , these outputs do not match the perfect binary output states of the corresponding electronic logic gates . However , each individual RNA molecule indeed has a binary output just like an individual electronic logic gate . Each tandem riboswitch aptamer transcript is either terminated ( OFF ) or fully transcribed ( ON ) , but the band intensities from analytical gel electrophoresis report on the results of the population of transcripts . The outputs of the riboswitch logic gate can be further complicated by at least two issues . First , an individual transcript might fail to function properly , say by misfolding of an aptamer domain , such that it cannot respond to the presence of a ligand . This failure mode might help explain the imperfect yields of terminated and full-length transcripts observed when examining riboswitches by in vitro transcription assays . It seems likely that folding problems of RNAs prepared in vitro might be less prominent when the RNAs are produced by cells . This means that high levels of transcription read-through that is non-responsive to the absence of ligand are not evident in reporter gene assays because the riboswitch aptamers have evolved to fold properly and on a relevant timescale in the cellular milieu . Second , the presence or absence of the two ligand inputs will change the function of the logic gate system at the individual transcript level , and therefore change the frequency of their choice of these two states rather than change the number of output states possible . Unlike electronic logic gates that use electrical current at only two values ( off and on ) , ligand concentrations for riboswitches can be highly variable . Therefore , given the nature of ligand binding to receptors ( each described by an equilibrium constant equation ) , differences in ligand concentrations will result in differences in the probabilities that the two riboswitch aptamers will be occupied . This occupancy distribution will be reflected in the transcriptional output of the RNA population , but each individual transcript still yields a binary output ( terminated or full-length product ) that is biased by the concentrations of ligands present . The IMPLY gate described herein involves a riboswitch RNA with aptamers for the RNA nucleobase guanine and the RNA precursor PRPP . While tandem riboswitch systems have previously been described ( Figure 6 ) , the guanine-PRPP system is the only example of two tandem aptamers with different ligand specificities that share the same expression platform , allowing for a new type of logic function to be implemented . All of these RNA systems demonstrate complex chemical sensing and regulatory functions , which perhaps reflects the complexity of systems used for metabolite monitoring and biological regulation in ancient RNA World organisms . Furthermore , it seems likely that additional variations of two-input Boolean logic gates will be represented by tandem riboswitches that have yet to be discovered in modern cells . 
 Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with the exceptions of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( Santa Cruz Biotech ) and guanosine 5′ , 3′-bisdiphosphate ( TriLink Biotech ) . [γ-32P]-ATP and [α-32P]-UTP were purchased from Perkin Elmer and used within two weeks of receipt . Bulk chemicals were purchased from J . T . Baker and enzymes from New England Biolabs , unless otherwise noted . All solutions were prepared using deionized water ( dH2O ) and were either autoclaved or filter sterilized ( using 0 . 22 µm filters , Millipore ) prior to use . DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Integrated DNA Technologies . A list of oligonucleotides used in this study can be found in Supplementary file 1 . Additional examples of ykkC motif RNAs were identified using Infernal 1 . 1 ( Nawrocki and Eddy , 2013 ) to search RefSeq version 76 plus additional environmental microbial databases as described previously ( Weinberg et al . , 2015 ) . Iterative searches for new sequences were performed based on the previously published alignment of ykkC subtype 2 RNAs ( Nelson et al . , 2017 ) . These sequences were sorted by nucleotide identity at a specific position as previously indicated ( Nelson et al . , 2017 ) to exclude guanidine-I riboswitches , then further manually sorted by downstream gene association , as described above . This revealed 257 unique examples of subtype 2b RNAs ( PRPP riboswitches ) , 127 of which are found in tandem with a guanine aptamer . The consensus sequence and secondary structure model was constructed using R2R software ( Weinberg and Breaker , 2011 ) . Double-stranded DNA ( dsDNA ) templates for RNA transcription were produced either by extension of overlapping synthetic DNAs ( Supplementary file 1 ) using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for the F . ignava construct or by PCR from genomic DNA for B . megaterium construct . Primers were designed to contain a 5′-terminal T7 RNA polymerase ( T7 RNAP ) promoter to enable transcription . The desired RNA constructs were prepared from these dsDNAs by in vitro transcription , purified , and subsequently 5′ 32P-labeled as previously described ( Nelson et al . , 2017; Sherlock et al . , 2017 ) . In-line probing assays ( Soukup and Breaker , 1999; Regulski and Breaker , 2008 ) were performed precisely as described previously ( Nelson et al . , 2017; Sherlock et al . , 2017 ) . DNA constructs for single-round in vitro transcription were designed to carry the riboswitch of interest spanning from the predicted natural transcription start site to 55 ( H . modesticaldum construct ) or 26 ( B . megaterium construct ) nucleotides following the terminator stem . The promoter from the B . subtilis lysC gene , which is compatible with E . coli RNA polymerase , was used for both in vitro transcription termination as well as the lacZ reporter experiments detailed below . Mutations were incorporated in the region of the B . megaterium construct before the guanine aptamer so that it contained no cytidines , while the H . modesticaldum construct was naturally cytidine-deficient . Synthetic double-stranded DNA templates were designed , purchased ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) and subsequently amplified by PCR for the H . modesticaldum constructs whereas constructs for the WT and M3 through M5 B . megaterium riboswitch were amplified from the plasmids containing those inserts for the reporter gene fusion , as described below . Approximately 2 pmol of the resulting , purified DNA template was added to a transcription initiation mixture ( 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7 . 5 at 23°C] , 75 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT , 10 µg mL−1 bovine serum albumin [BSA] , 130 µM ApA dinucleotide , 1% glycerol , 0 . 04 U µL−1 E . coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme , 2 . 5 µM GTP , 2 . 5 µM ATP , and 1 µM UTP ) . Approximately 1 µCi [α-32P]-UTP was added per 8 µL reaction and transcription was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 10 min , leading to formation of a stalled polymerase complex at the first cytidine nucleotide of each transcript . For each 8 µL transcription reaction , 1 µL of 10x elongation buffer ( 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7 . 5 at 23°C] , 75 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT , 2 mg mL−1 heparin , 1 . 5 mM ATP , 1 . 5 mM GTP , 1 . 5 mM CTP , and 250 µM UTP ) as well as 1 µL of a 10x solution of the ligand of interest were added sequentially . Transcription reactions were then incubated at 37°C for an additional 60 min . The transcription products were subsequently analyzed via denaturing ( 8 M urea ) 10% PAGE and visualized using a phosphorimager ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . Fraction full length values were calculated by varying the ligand concentration in separate reactions and quantifying the changes in band intensity of both full length ( FL ) and terminated ( T ) transcription products using the formula ( FL ) / ( FL +T ) . The T50 values were determined by plotting the fraction FL as a function of the logarithm of ligand concentration and using a sigmoidal four parameter logistic fit in GraphPad Prism 7 . Riboswitch-reporter constructs consisting of the B . subtilis lysC gene promoter and either the H . modesticaldum or B . megaterium riboswitch fused upstream of the E . coli lacZ gene were inserted into the vector pDG1661 as described previously ( Sudarsan et al . , 2003; Nelson et al . , 2017 ) and integrated into the amyE locus of wild-type WT ( 1A1 strain 168 Δtrp ) or ΔpurF strains ( BKE06490 [erythromycin resistant] and BKK06490 [kanamycin resistant] ) obtained from the Bacillus Genetic Stock Center , The Ohio State University ) B . subtilis ( Meyer et al . , 2011 ) . The resulting transformed strains were verified to exhibit the expected resistance to chloramphenicol as well as kanamycin for the ΔpurF::kan strains . Additionally , each strain was confirmed to contain the desired riboswitch reporter sequence by colony PCR amplification followed by sequencing . For example , PCR amplification using primers flanking the purF locus followed by sequencing confirmed either the WT purF gene ( WT strains ) or kanamycin-resistance gene ( ΔpurF::kan strains ) as expected . Mutations were incorporated into the B . megaterium reporter construct by using Quikchange site-directed mutagenesis ( Agilent Technologies ) . Reporter experiments were performed by inoculating various B . subtilis strains into Lysogeny Broth ( LB ) with appropriate antibiotics and growing overnight at 37°C . For experiments with the singlet H . modesticaldum reporter , the bacteria were diluted into lysogeny broth ( LB ) , grown for an additional 4–6 hr until culture growth was visible , centrifuged , supernatant removed , the resuspended in glucose minimal media ( GMM ) . For experiments with the tandem B . megaterium reporter , bacteria were diluted directly into either LB or GMM , as indicated , and grown for 6 hr with or without supplemented guanine .
