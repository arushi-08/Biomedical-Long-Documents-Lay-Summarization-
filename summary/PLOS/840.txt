 Summary


This paper explores why, contrary  to expectations derived solely considering spatial structure alone ("Price Equation" ), actual patterns frequently exhibit substantial temporal fluctuations. It finds surprisingly strong evidence indicating mutualistic coexistence within certain bacterial communities occurs precisely BECAUSE OF frequent "defactor"-driven crashes rather THAN DESPITE them! Their key finding challenges conventional wisdom regarding competitive exclusion principles governing species interaction - namely，the widespread assumption according   which superior competitors should consistently outperform weaker ones irrespective    of numerical dominance (“competitive Exclusion Principle”). Contrary     with expectation,, real world systems commonly display temporary rescues driven entirely       by occasional lucky occurrences resulting primarily FROM THE EXTINCTION AND RESCUE Of COOPERATORS BY DEFECCTOR ACTIVITY OR RESOURCE LIMITATION THAT FOLLOWED THEIR CONSUMPTION BUT NOT necessarily THROUGH DIRECT COMPETITION WITH BETTER COMPETITORS FOR RESOURCES AS SUGGESTed By THIS PRINCIPLE ([“Sympatric Species Problem”]). Although seemingly paradoxical phenomena like synchronized boom‐bust cycling appear challenging enough theoretically owing TO HIGH Spatial Heterogeneity And Stochasticity inherent IN NATURAL SYSTEMS,,, recent studies reveal analogous behaviors routinely occurring regularly inside diverse ecosystems ranging From BacteriaTo Humans!.
