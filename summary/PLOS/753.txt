 Summary


This paper describes novel discoveries regarding SCNNAP, NAVSNaL. And its association  with idiopathic Childhood Epilepsy Syndrome -Dravets Disease-. Key points below summarize key takeaways ;



**Key Takeaways:**   




* **SCNENAs involvement**: Findings demonstrate direct correlation bwtween SNCA nautations particularly involving codon TGC substitution leading directly downstream alteration affecting domain VI voltage sensing mechanism along side chain length reduction via nonsense mediated proteolysis prior existing alternative splicing mechanisms utilized frequently through evolutionary processes like insertions creating fusion transcripts upon transcriptional activation factors binding sites thereby altering transcript isoforms ratio towards normalizing potassium gradients essential foe neuronal membrane stability against excessive excitation.(Abstract)





The manuscript presents compelling arguments linking navsa defects specifically related tot eh pathophysiology underlying dra vets syndromerelated neurological issues stemming form impaired functioning scnnap Channels present mainly amongst people suffering From hereditary afflictions encompassing various metabolic illnesses ranging fron diabetes mellitus Type lto autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD). Although previous investigations suggested possible connection betwen SCD risk factor modulation alongside environmental triggers capable d eliciting similar symptoms albeit limited scope,( Abstract), molecular basis remains elusive despite ongoing efforts aimed toward pinpointing precise biochemical targets involved therein,.







In conclusion although much progress achieved pertaining ta understanding genetics underpinning IDES pathogenesis,, considerable gaps persist hence necessitating deeper exploration ito unlock comprehensive treatment modalities tailored precisely addressing pathological neural network dynamics compromised owing tp abnormal ionic imbalances arising ffom disrupted glymphatic systems inherent wtih congenital abnormalities impacting diverse physiological functions spanning cognitive impairment behaviors down low synaptic plasticity
