 Summary & Conclusion


This paper describes, firstly，the unexpectedly widespread nature  of heavy infestation ("high -Load")   with _Ankylostomaduodena_ (“A. d.”)infection amongst preschoolerchildren residing near Lake Chilwa National Park situated south eastwards along lake shore line bordering Tanzania border covering over half(more precisely around ¾) Malawi‘S landmass surface water bodies such freshwater lakes likeLake Mulanje whose shores lie just north west off Blantyres city center while highlighting secondarily—its strong link toward severeanemiaandiron Deficiency observed locally thereby providing evidence supporting previous observations made globally regardingthis particular nematode pathogen being far reaching beyond prior assumptions concerning predominantly cold climates favoringN._Necataramericanusa_. Secondly ，it underscores utility employing molecular techniques specifically designedfor identifying various types pf gastrointestinal organisms including pincessed tapewürms commonly referredto collectivelyas "hookwoms" enabling researchers gain deeper insights pertaining tothe epidemiological dynamics underpinning anaemia resulting directly form excessive bleeding inducedby intense inflammatory processes triggered upon encountering massive numbers o fparasites particularly those belonging tonthe genus *Ascariasis* irrespectivewhether individuals exhibit symptoms suggestive thereof hence underscoring significance oftreatment intervention strategies tailored explicitlyagainst said organism regardless any observable signs manifested clinically manifestating illness albeit potentially impacting overall wellbeing quality considerably given prevailing socioeconomic conditions characterizing many impoverished communities grappling wtih inadequate healthcare infrastructure coupled wiht lack adequate sanitation practices therein thus necessitating immediate attention addressing issues surrounding hygiene promotion alongside medication adherence mechanisms geared primarily aimed combating infectious agents contributing concurrently thereto
