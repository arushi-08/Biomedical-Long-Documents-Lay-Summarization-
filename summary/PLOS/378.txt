 Summary & Conclusion


This text describes, analyzes  and summarizes recent discoveries about serine protease haemorrhage inhibitory salivary molecules called serpentine hemotoxins. Specifically focusing upon newly discovered properties exhibited during interactions amongst human inflammatory responses triggered via enzymatic actions towards Extracellular Matrix Components(ECMs) like Collagen TypeIV&VI alongwith Nidrin -a major structural element comprising Blood Vessel Basement Membranes-(BM). Here they describe changes occurring throughout inflammation caused specifically targeted attacks toward said ECMAcomponents employed primarily produced By Three Serpin Family Members belonging To Group III â€“ namely Bovine Serum Albuminin Hemotoxin Alpha,(BaPH), Batroxophurin Haemagglutatin And Ceratoxin B.(CsHB)-These potent serpins inhibit clotting Factor XIIIA thereby limiting thrombin generation while promoting excessive bleeding commonly seen alongside severe injuries sustained During bites inflicted Upon Humans Of venomous serpents,.   The paper explores biochemical pathways involved therein highlighting disparities encountered Between Pi-, IIAnd iii HaemorrhragicsV MPs emphasizing Their unique distributions Within damaged Tissues While demonstrating comparable effectiveness despite differing degrees expressed Hemeostasis disruption achieved Via direct attack Against substrate Molecules Like Laminnin,,CollagenType iv,,,It appears That Although possessing superior catalytic efficiency Over Its counterparts.,PI svmps exhibit wider spread Throughout injured Tissue..,While piIIs tend More Towards concentrated zones Where Damage Is Most Prominent.. Overall Findings Provide Novel Insights Into Mechanisms Leading UpTo Microcirculatory Injury AssociatedWith Serpent Venom Action
