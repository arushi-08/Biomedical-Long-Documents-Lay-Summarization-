 Summary  


This study investigates, via molecular techniques based upon amplified fragments length polymorphisms ("AFLPs") spanning fifteen nuclear marker genes distributed over various chromosomes throughout known ranges worldwide. Additionally incorporates approximate bayesian computational methodologies (“Approximate Bayesain Computations” - ABCs) aimed specifically toward understanding pathways leading ultimately either directly onto invasions involving admixed progeny stemming largely form southeast asia OR indirectly contributing substantially once widespread expansions occur globally post invasiion(e). Findings suggest distinct contributions made uniquely identifiable amongst diverse regional groupings formed predominantly owing solely too unique haplotypes inherited locally rather intermixing extensively beyond reproductive isolation zones encompassing entire continents like Eurasia itself despite extensive gene flow originating therein,. Such disparities potentially underpin variations seen consistently documented pertaining susceptibility against virus infection exhibited concurrently alongside substantial introgression rates commonly encountered amidst invading vectors harborING novel pathogens capable transmitting deadly infections associated closely enough physically yet distant phylogenetically relative numerous kilometers away.. Ultimately highlighting vulnerabilities susceptible communities require immediate intervention strategies tailored explicitly targeting genotypes currently dominating wild insect collections whilst minimizing collateral damage inadvertently inflicted secondary effects arising frequently accompanying aggressive control measures employed routinely deployed attempting suppression interventions intended curtail spreading pathogen prevalence effectively
