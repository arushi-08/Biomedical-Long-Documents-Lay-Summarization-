 Summary  


This paper describes, identifies pathogenic variations affecting hyalurosidase II(HA) degrading capacity leading directly through impaired tissue homeostasis. These observations elucidate mechanisms underlying various complex disorders involving abnormal growth patterns like oro facials fissures alongwith newly recognized cardiovascular impairments known ass "cortriatrum sinster" - hitherto unreported alongside typical oral deformaties characteristic often accompanying untreated patients suffering afflictions related specifically t ohyaluronicacid metabolism via targeting excessive hyaluronic acids production :



**Key Findings:**   




* Mutations disrupting HASlII degradetion resultsin distinct clincal presentations ranging fron mild disfigurement tp lethal outcomes highlighting diverse biological functions governed solely thru modulation og HOAs degradation dynamics..    The discovery underscores therapeutic interventions aimed towards mitigating adverse consequences stemming fromabsence OF adequate proteolytic activities influencing overall health disparities experienced globally irrespective pf geographic boundaries,.     It offers insights pertaining tothe complexity inherent ito understand ingthe precise interplay betwen biochemical perturbations ad structural deviations manifested manifestation arising therfrom,, thereby paving way fo rfurther exploration regarding targeted treatments tailored precisely against specific genotypes implicated therein.<br>.
