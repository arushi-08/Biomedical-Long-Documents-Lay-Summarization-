 Summary & Implications


This paper investigates potential biomarkers, namely alpha Smooth Muscle Actin(α SMA), ProCollagan One  and Keratins Cytoskeleton Protein -Keratan Type Sixteen,(CK) – expressions alongside histological alterations throughout various stages post antibiotics treating bururi ulser. Overall its objective aims towards understanding factors influencing poorwound Healing Delay seen predominantly among individuals living remotely across Sub Saharan regions especially those afflicted With Buri Ulcers Disease Complex.(BU).   The primary finding highlights significant variations amongst tissues extracted From both freshly diagnosed lessions pre-,during And Post Treatment revealing unique patterns Of Cell Activation AND Matrix Deposition Through Various Markers Such As AlphaSmoothmuscleActin PositiveMyfibrobasts Which Play An Integral Role Not Just Contraction But Also Production OF Extra Cellular Matricies Proteins Like Collagen To Facilitate Granual Formation Over Time Course Following Antibiotic Therapy Completion.. Furthermore,, Increased Expression Levels Were Observed Across Different Lesions Associated WITH THE Presence Active Inflammatory Cells Including MacrophagesAnd Neutrophils Prior TO Therapeutic Intervention Whereas Subsequent Administration Marked By Reduced Inflammation Leading Towards Successful Closure Wounds Showed Prominent Expressions IF KiSSED BY MYOFIBROBLAST ACTIVITY AFTER TREATMENT THAT CONTINUES FOR Extended Period Even Though Skin May Appear Healed On Surface Level,. Finally，the researchers suggest exploring therapeutic avenues targeting pathways regulating fibrosis Or promoting angiogenesis Could Be Investigational Targets Given Their Potential Impact Upon Improved Outcome Measures Within Future Treatments Strategies Against BURU ULCER DISEASE complexe
