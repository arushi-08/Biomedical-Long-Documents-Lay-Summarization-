 Summary & Conclusion


This paper investigates  the impact   of rodentice communities' compositions upon haemmorrhage Fever Renal Syndrome(HRFS) occurance. This comprehensive review summarizes key points :



**Main Findings:**




* **Rodents**: Rat spp.(Norvecicus, Flaviaectust), Muskratts,,and House Mice dominate captures despite variations yearly capture numbers due seasonal patterns ;Mmusculis increases steadily till reaching its maximum countin g `In `The majority o fcases occurrs around cultivated Lands,;built up Areas;,grassLAND AND FOREST LAND exhibits LOW incidences OF THE DISEASE BUT NOT WATER BODIES.<br> ﻿





 * High correlations exist betwen actual versus predicated probabilitie s Of HRFSRoccurence FOR EACH YEAR EXCEPT BETWEEN OFF - DIAGONAL DATA WITH ON_Diagonal ones.**

***Key takeaways ***::    Although there exists considerable temporal variablitiy regarding weather condition sinChnzou,(e., tempreaturte nd RH ), agricultural practices appear tyo exert greater controls OVER HAND THe overall spread pf tehdisease compared tp climatic factor,.Therefore controlling rat populatiuons particularly those inhabiting CultivatetdLand might prove beneficial ito reducing he burden posed BY THIS deadly illness
