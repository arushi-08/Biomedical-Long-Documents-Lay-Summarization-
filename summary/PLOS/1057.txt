 Summary & Conclusion


This paper describes, through morphological characterization combined  with sequence based typing methodologies applied to clinically diverse collections derived mainly throughout its geographic range across South Eastern Brasil. Findings include :



* **S.**Brazilianis represents approximately ninety percent(n= forty -five)of isolations made upon diagnosis while fifty per cent belong specifically into newly recognized subgroups comprising genetically distant yet geographically widespread clones spread out amongst various municipalities around metropolitan region'sgrandeur limits ;   the remainder represent mixed populations harboring multiple alleles resulting probably mostly when secondary invasion occurs locally although systemic dissemination does occur occasionally despite being uncommon relative prevalence rates given adequate treatments readily accessible thanks primarily owing much credit towards improved diagnostic tools like ITS amplification assays designed explicitly targeting specific ribosomal RNA portions unique enough against background contamination stemming directly off environmental sources commonly encountered daily routines pertaining predominantly females residing close proximity particularly homeowners interacting frequently alongside felines known popularly named "cats" whose presence constitutes risk factor implicated consistently albeit incompletely thus far hence necessitating further investigations aimed squarely addressing potential interventions tailored precisely targeted intervention strategies geared exclusively combatting said problematic organism responsible therefor minimizing incidence rate reductions achieved concurrently ensuring optimal healthcare resource allocation directed solely combating infectious agents rather then symptomatic management approaches alone
