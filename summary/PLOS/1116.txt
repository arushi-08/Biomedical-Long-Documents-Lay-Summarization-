 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes alterations  of various biomarkers, mainly focusing around biliary salts like cholecystitis. Here' s its key takeaways :



**Key Findings:**




* **Metabolite Profiling**: Serum metabonomics investigations reveal distinctive sets if differently regulated molecules across diverse stages(critical vs recovering) within dengueaffected subjects highlighting unique pathophysiological shifts occurring throughout infected course..   The presence Of particular markers enables differentiation Between severe "severe" Disease From moderate Fever Cases And provides insight Into Potential Therapeutic Targets With High Accuracy At Early Stages OF THE Illness.<br><BR>.    In critically ill Patients During Their Acute Phase Over Half Were Successfully Classified Within One Cluster Which Demonstrates Method Stability Across Samples Through Principal Component Analyses.(S Figure). Additionally，the variations seen here offer opportunities FOR Further Research Leading TO Novel Treatment Strategies Against Severe Clinical Manifestations Associated WITH THIS Viral Infections.**





***Additional Observations ***







• Higher bilirubin concentrations characterize advanced severity reflecting compromised Liver function amongst severely sick Individuals ; however some degree pf elevation persists Post Recovery signifying Prolonged Effects Upon Organ Damage DueTo Chronic Inflammation Or Metabolic Dysregulation Following Virus Elimination That May Lead Upto Long Term Complications Such AS Neurological Disorders Known By Neuropsychiatry Syndrome Related Conditions Including Cognitive Impairment AND Mood Swings.-These observations underscore importance Ofthe needFor Comprehensive Management strategies encompassing Not Just Short term Relief But Also Rehabilitation Measures Tailored Specifically Towards Each Patient Throughout All PhasesOf Infectio
