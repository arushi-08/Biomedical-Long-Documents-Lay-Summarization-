 Summary & Relevance


This paper describes  an innovative methodology, termed Phename Wide Associations Stud(PheWas) conducted utilizing quantifiable phenotypic attributes. Specifically focusing upon "thio purinecS methyl transferase" enzyme assay outcomes ("TPMT") alongside diagnostic coding information derived through International Statistical Classification System - Tenth Edition (“ICD‐O”) coded medical documents pertaining specifically individuals receiving medication involving thiouracil derivatives commonly prescribed against inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohns’ Disease amongst various medications utilized during treatments targeting metabolic pathways involved therein..   The primary objective pursued throughoutthis investigation involves identifying novel subsets characterized via distinct patterns exhibited across diverse sets comprising clinicopathological manifestations documented electronically stored healthrecords encompassing details about individual encounters alongwith biochemical markers reflecting systemic alterations impacting overall wellness conditions prevailing prior initiating therapies designed primarily intended combatting said illnesses mentioned beforehand,. Ultimately highlighting opportunities afforded due diligence toward tailoring tailored interventions catering precisely targeted populations exhibiting unique profiles stemming solely attributable variations inherent thereto rather generic ones prevalent universally irrespective distinctive circumstances encountered individually thereby optimizing healthcare delivery strategies effectively addressing varied aspects influencing optimal pharmaceutical intervention effectiveness achieved collectively enhancing quality assurance standards implemented worldwide
