 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes detailed investigations aimed towards identifying potential therapeutic targets through transcriptome Profiling. It explores alterations occurring throughout lesional progress, focusing specifically upon dynamic shifts involving various immune subsets along  with metabolic transformations characteristic   for advancing pathological conditions commonly encountered across cardiovascular disordersâ€”namely obesity diabetes mellitus hypertension etc.. Through extensive experimentation combined bioinformatics techniques they successfully deciphered key players driving excessive deposition fo adipose tissue resulting ultimately leadening toward enhanced susceptibility prone vascular damage seen often clinical manifestations manifest due course chronic illnesses mentioned earlier,. Their approach yielded valuable insights regarding intricate relationships existing amongst numerous molecules comprising diverse signaling cascades crucial underlying pathophysiology guiding future drug design strategies designed combatting aggressive forms premature aging alongside promoting overall health longevity via modulation selective intervention tactics tailored precisely those particular molecule interaction dynamics unveiled here today
