This text describes experimental procedures related primarily  to investigations involving melatonin receptor signalling, particularly focusing "on tracing connections"between specialized neuronal populations. While detailed methodologies encompass various techniques - rangingfrom tissue preparation methods & histology approaches – it lacks specifics pertaining specifically'single‐cell recording', hence limiting comprehension about certain segments presented below :


**Single Cell Recording:** Single Unit Isolation And Response Characterisation The provided description does describe overall methodology well except crucial details concerning isolating individual cellular electrical activities ("SINGLE CELL RECORDING"). Notably missing elements include descriptions outlining precise steps involved therein ; namely electrode implantation strategies utilized prior conducting intracellular voltage measurements nor mention detailing criteria guiding selection&amp;, characterising isolated electrically active entities ('spikes') arising due course natural variations inherent biological systems
