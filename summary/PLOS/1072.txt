 Summary & Conclusion


This text describes detailed methodologies employed, along  with key finding regarding _P.wasabiace* scccrity characteristics through various techniques like genomics profiling,, phylogenetics,,,and experimentation involving microbial physiology,. Here summarizes highlights :



**Key Findings:**




• **Species reclassification**: Reanalysis led researchers classify *SCCBriangain isolate SCPCCSB FSDD within "wasabe" ratherthan 'carotborvm'. As result，the prevalenceof wsaebie might actually higher thant initially believed.<br>   < br/>      <li>-The newly reported wholegenome shotgun seqeuncing offers valuable insight ito understanding pathogenesis mechanismss underlying low incidence infections.** </LI><Br /> 





 • ***Novelty detection*** – Novel candidate virluence factor includes those involved int Type I Secretion System(TI SS) components ; hoplin,; tnflsal domain superfamily members;, adhesins., metabolic regulators.., extracellular polymeric substances.,, secondary metabolites.,. And toxins..These discoveries expand upon current knowledge pertaining tothe pathophysiology pf pectobacterialinfection models.***
