 Summary  of Findings


This study investigated mechanisms employed upon establishment, subsequent trafficking across cellular layers. And finalization stages during muridoviral sensory nerve invasion focusing specifically towards understanding initial attachment & receptor interaction dynamics occurring uniquely inside mammalian noses following aerosol exposure..



**Key takeaways:**   




* **Neuroinvasion**: Upon entering susceptible tissuesMuRHVs exploit receptors present mainly alongside Hepagan Sulfate(hs) molecules located appositionately distributed among neural structures particularly lining prominent mucous membranes situated deepwithin peripheral organsâ€”the odour sensing region represents prime anatomical vulnerability points utilized frequently encountered clinically manifest diseases involving systemic involvement resulting ultimately death if left untreated.(Abstract).
