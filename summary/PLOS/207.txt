 Summary & Conclusion


This paper describes  a large case Series, comprising nearly thousand individuals affected By Stronglylodes Stercuralisias Infection. Its primary objective aims To characterize epidemiologic features along With Clinical Manifestations For Importation Into Non‐Endemic Areas Such AS spain Through Retrospective Analysis Over An Extended Period Between Years That Span Several Decades Across Different Centers Distributed Throughout Countrywide Territory :



**Key Findings:**




* **High Seroprevalence**: Serum testing enabled diagnosing approximately ¾rdOf Cases ; mainly owingTo High Sensitivity ComparedWith Classical Parasitalogical Techniques Which DetectedLarvaeIn Less Than One Percent OF THE PATIENTS AND SEROLOGY ALLOWED FOR DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS IN MORE THAN HALFThe CASES WITH CONFIRMED Diagnosis Based On Laboratory Tests Alone Or Microscopy Examination Methods Were Not Sensitive Enough TO DETECT LARVAE BUT Allowed Us Successfully Diagnose Many Infections Where Microscopic Examinations Had Failed Thus Increasing Our CapacityFor Early RecognitionAnd Prompt Intervention Against Severe Disease Associated Factors Like Moderate /SevereEosinopohia Are Highly RelatedTO ConfirmedDiagnosis While Being Immigrant Group Is Negatively Correlated If You Have Definitediagnosis At Odds Ratio Around HalfThat Found Previously Under Controlled Trials Conditions But Albendazaole Still Shows Lower Cure RateThanIvermectin Especially Within First Few Months Posttreatment Follow Up So Screening Should Be Mandatory Prioritizing Those ComingFrom Endemc Regions Who May Develop Serious Illness Particularly Individuals Having Certain Risk FactorSuchAs Immunocompromised State
