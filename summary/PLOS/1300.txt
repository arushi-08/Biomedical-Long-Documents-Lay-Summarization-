 Summary & Conclusion


This paper reports novel finding regarding Bovine Spongform Encephalropathy(Tse) infections. Researchers discovered  the Presence, quantification，and transferabilityof Infectiousprincreasedin cow’smilk across multiple stages throughout pregnancy—colostrumshowcaseshighinfectiosity comparedwith mature cows‘milksample collection procedures involving manual stripping ratherthan milking machines significantly increased infective loads due tothe inclusion oftuberculosis rospyers along side blood vessels leading awayfrom udder skin surface ; therefore increasing sampling difficulty especiallyduring later lactationalperiods). Although there hasn t yetbeenany documented instancewhere raw mammalian breastfeed contributed substantially towards transmittinginfectiousagentsassociated wtih boviscerpin amyloidosis,(BoAS),these discoveries warrant further studies investigating whether similar scenarios might occur inadvertently upon accidental ingestionthroughcontaminated foods derived entirely fromamall mammals harborING PRNP mutations rendering themmore prone toscrapiesinfection。
