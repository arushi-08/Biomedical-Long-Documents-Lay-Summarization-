 Summary & Conclusion


This text describes  the BrCa exchange, designed specifically aimed towards improving standardized practices while promoting efficient implementation. Here summarizes highlights :



**Objective:**   To facilitate effective identification，classification、interpretation 、aggregation ，And distribution (IAAG) Of variations impacting tumor susceptibility conferred upon DNA molecules encoding proteins involved mainly In hereditary forms OF Breast And Ovarian Cancer Genes – namely _Brcal_ 和  __BRCAl_.




* **Key achievements**:    A platform integrating heterogeneous datasets ; Standardization procedures implemented alongside guidelines established collaboratively amongst experts internationally.; Improved accessibility achieved thanks tothe creationOf Mobile app offering insights about changed annotations pertaining t o Variants..
