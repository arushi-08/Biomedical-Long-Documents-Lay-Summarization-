 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes  a methodology, named "denoicing" utilizing topological characteristics extracted via geometrical embeddings generated specifically tailored toward characterizing interactome topologies. Here’ s overview summarizes highlights :



**Key Findings:**




• **High Confidence Interactions**: Successfully implemented geometry inspired algorithmic framework leveraging LOW DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRIC RANDOM GRAMS formalism effectively identifies confident candidate interacts across diverse species like humans AND Yeast..   The achieved sensitivities reach up tp around ninety percent alongside specificities exceeding eighty five %.    These outcomes rival state –of art methodologies relying primarily upon structural attributes OR domain composition BUT WITHOUT requiring extensive prior molecular insights regarding either individuals molecules Or intricate mechanisms underlying said associations,.     It offers advantages over alternative strategies involving secondary structures OF BINDING DOMIANS FOR instance due TO ITS reliance solely ON THE NETWORK STRUCTURE itself instead THAN ANY STRUCTURAL INFORMATION ABOUT PROTEIN MOLECULES,,, making IT MORE GENERALizable Across Different Biological Systems And Species,, although lacking explicit mechanistic interpretations associated WITH EACH INTERACTION Pair.., highlighting Its broad applicability beyond single instances.,.
