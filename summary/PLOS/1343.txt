This paper explores  the relationship tussentissue patterning,whole -organismdevelopmental tempoerature. They findthat despite substantial variations throughoutdevelopment，wing disk pattering precisely overlapswith majorDevelopmental landmarks suchas moliting And Pupartion。However ，at Wandering—which marks roughly halfwaythrough Development —pattern exhibits less precision.<br>< br/>The researchers employed multiple techniques including immunohistologyto track marker proteins' expressionsin order tp characterize temporal evolutionof spatial arrangementsduring organogenesis,.
