 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes detailed investigations exploring  the interplay amongst various nuclear complexes, namely those involving Transcription Coupled Repair Factor Complex member Csb. Specifically，it delves deep onto :



**Nucleome Restructuring:**   It reveals novel connections linking Napilike helicase homologues -Napalh(r) –with Csbs’ intrinsic remodelling capabilities via direct physical bindings.. Through extensive experimentation they discovered evidence suggesting distinct yet complementary effects exerted collectively versus separately against damaged genomic regions following ultraviolet radiation induced injury.<br>




 **Functional Implications**: They explored potential therapeutic avenues stemming directly related tot eh newly unveiled mechanistic framework connecting transcriptional modulation alongside repairs processes initiated post damaging events caused primarily because excessive sunlight exposition leads severe skin cancer formation along genetic instability issues commonly afflicting individuals suffering systemic disorders namedCockayne Syndrome.(Figure &nbsp;(See below))<p/>
