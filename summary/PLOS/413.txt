 Summary & Discussion


This manuscript describes  a novel approach, combining transcript profiling via stranding sequence specifically targeting transcripts encoding Carbohydrate Active Zymogens(CAZYms) alongwith functional analyses through overexpression studies. Through integrating data mining approaches across genomics databases like UniProtKB alongside experimental validation techniques involving cultivation media optimization strategies coupled metabolic flux modeling tools enables researchers gain insights about bacterial utilization patterns towards diversified carbohydrates derived primarily form agricultural crops namely rice straw waste products—corn cob residue—“bagasse”—and sugarcane bagasses (“stover”).
