 Summary:


This paper describes,  the epidemiology characteristics relatedness incidence patterns across diverse geographic areas within KSA. It highlights that diabetes mellitus & prior TB diagnosis emerged significantly amongst individuals diagnosed with Non Tuberculosis Myco bacteria(NMT) illness along side demographic variables comprising sex category males dominance ; Age bracket older adults susceptibility& nationality predilection toward Saudis' highest percentage share overall isolate profiles reflected regional variations seen worldwide but uncommonly extensive range encompassing nearly all provinces especially west coast dominating certain organisms e g.,M..abscesses ussing molecular techniques combined pathology reports enabled accurate classification into distinct categories ranging between novel variants through intermediate strains highlighting importance placed upon surveillance mechanisms designed specifically targeting unique genetic markers employed routinely used during routine diagnostics procedures implemented locally throughout hospitals serving wider community needs effectively addressing issues pertaining inadequate infrastructure facilities coupled poor awareness regarding contagious agents leading ultimately impacting quality healthcare outcomes achieved via early detection interventions tailored precisely based off comprehensive understanding gained over course duration
