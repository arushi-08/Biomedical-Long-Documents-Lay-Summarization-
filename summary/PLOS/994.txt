 Summary & Conclusion


This paper describes investigations exploring relationships amongst existing inflammatory mediators, specifically focusing upon interferon gamma ("INFgamma")  and interleukin six (“Il.l”), within peripheral mononuclear leukocytes(PBML) derived form healthy donors residing amidst high endemicity regions where there'S ongoing risk pertaining dengue viral serotypes—DEnvserotype –infections throughout much part pf Southeast Asia.. Here they sought out ways through analyzing cellular dynamics via intravitro approaches designed primarily around standardized molecular techniques like multiplex arrays encompassing numerous biomarkers alongside traditional methods employed routinely deployed when studying inflammation processes occurring concurrently wtih actual pathological manifestations arising directly resultant fron природ exposures,. Their overarching objective rested firmly rooted n understanding precisely what sets apart subgroups susceptible towards developing debilitating complications stemming solely because o differing host susceptibility patterns exhibited vis à vie regarding severity manifested once exposed tyo pathogen agents comprising diverse genotypes belonging tot eh genus Flaviridae family Coronavirdae).   



**Key Findings:**




* **Higher Production Of Pro‐Inflammatory Mediators**: Within Subclinically Infected Individuals Compared To Symptomatologically Ill Cases:- Notably enhanced expressions od Il‑Six And McP−One emerged prominently under circumstances characterized bye symptmatic manifestation whereas decreased productions occured concurrent wiyh certain key protectivccytoknes namely INFggama,, il −Two,,,And ILCʼa––all suggestive evidence pointing tp potentially opposing effects governing systemic homeostasis equilibrium achieved thru modulation mediated mainly throuugh distinct regulatory networks governed largely influenced y genotype diversity displayed uniquely per seprated subtypes os flaviruses utilized foe experimental purposes.<br> <BR>.
