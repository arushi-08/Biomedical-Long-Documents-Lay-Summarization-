 Summary & Implications


This paper describes "Attypical Systemic Leprosy" -  a new manifestation, previously unrecognized. Previously documented forms include classic symptomatic visceral leprosy ("Kalaazar") featuring persistent fevers along side prominent hepatic involvement leading ultimately towards fatality due widespread intraorgan parasitic invasion via bloodstream spread throughout various bodily fluids ; alongside existing evidence suggestive proof points toward existence albeit mild manifestations commonly termed Sub Clinical Disease Of Cutaneous Lesions (“SCCL”). While both presentations involve immunosuppression enabling opportunistic pathogens exploit compromised host defense mechanisms thereby triggering recurring invasive complications primarily targeting exposed surfaces like mucous membranes – particularly involving digestive tracts -, cutaneous lesions remain dominant amongst observed pathologies associated directly attributable solely upon organism burdening susceptible individuals rather displaying extensive inflammatory reactions characteristic predominantly seen under conditions conducive favorable microbial growth during active phases following primary exposure scenarios against healthy hosts..
