 Summary & Relevance - Human Diploid Phrasing Study


This paper describes various methodologies employed, assessed  and contrasted，to accurately "Phase" ("determine precise genetic makeup") complete HUMAN genomics. It explores challenges faced while attempting full segregation (“unravel”) molecular structures known collectively AS alleles—variations derived during meiosis —within paired mammalian reproductive cells resulting ultimately FROM THE SAME biological organism BUT differing substantially IN SEQUENCE AND FUNCTIONING FORM OF EACH COPY Of EVERY CHROMOSOMEPAIR FOR ANY given person'S UNIQUE GENOMES..   The primary objective revolves AROUND harnessable solutions involving minimal expense alongside maximized efficiency via sophisticated algorithms designed specifically TO UNCOVER THIS intricate relationship BETWEEN PHASES And THEIR APPLICATIONS WITH RESPECT TOPHARMACEUTICAL DRUG TARGETTING OR DIAGNOSTIC PURPOSES RELATED THERETO ITSELF BY INCREASING ACCURACY THROUGH BETTER UNDERSTANDING ABOUT HOW VARIANTS ARE DISTRIBUTED AMONG HOMOLOGOUS Chromosomes Within An Individual GenoME.<br>< br>
