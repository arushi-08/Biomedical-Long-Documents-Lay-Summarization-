 Summary:  The Relationship Between Egg Counts Per Gram Feces ("EPGs") And Number OF Worms From Human Infections WITH CLONORCHIS SINENSIS


This paper investigates, among Korean adults living within areas affected primarily   by _Clonchorsis Sinens_i infestation. Its primary objective involves correlating "egg discharge" quantities measured utilizing KATO - KATZ technique (“EGP”) against actual retrieved matureworms following therapeutic intervention employing PRAZIQUANET®. Additionally，the researchers aimed determine approximate daily output estimates based off both extracted parasites along established correlations involving specific patient demographics like gender & aging groups while highlighting potential challenges associated directly collecting viable specimens when dealing specifically witn *C*sinenris*.



**Key Findings:**




• **High Correlation**: Significant Positive Association Found tussen EGG Count(S) AND NUMBER OR RECOVERED WORMS FROM HUMAN INFECTION BY ClonOrCHIStAS SINEnsI : An Estimated Minimum Infection Burden For Humans Through Quantitative Examination Using Eggs PER GRAM FECES Method.(r=o,.sixty eight One).  





&bull;&nbsp;- High variability exists regardingWorm Recovery Rates Across Different Ranges Associated To Corresponding EGPS Values Which Means That Not all Subjects Were Able TO Yield Similar Levels Or Parasites Regardless Whether Having Comparable Egp Scores.;







﻿ • Approximately At Least Eleven Hundred WorMs Are Infected Within THE BODY FOR EACH Individual Exhibiting Around Three Thousand Five hundred Forty Epgs ;
