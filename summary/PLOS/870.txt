 Summary & Relevance


This manuscript describes novel nanocomposite systems designed specifically towards treating parasitic diseases. Specifically, they focused  on improving existing therapies usingpoly myxcin b(PolA) – known primarilyforits effectivenessagainstGram−bacteria—to combat both fungal pathogensandbacterial contaminants commonly associatedwithLeISHMANIASIS sores createdbythe Protozoonan organism _LESHManiaamazonenesis_. Here'shownbelow summarizes key takeaways :



**Key Findings:**




* **Polybutyral cyno acrylate nanoparticules successfully encapsulate poliyoxamyn.** Thesenanoparticles exhibited promising characteristics including controlleddrugreleaseprofileover extended periods along withexcellentantimicrobialactivity againsthe bacterium_Pseudomonasaeruginosa_, thereby offeringa potent tool forembeddinginfection spread within wounds inflictedduringskindiseaseslike leprosy..   The abilityoftheseNPs tosupport antibiotictherapycould significantly improve outcomesassociatedwoundsthat often become compromiseddue tothesecondaryinfections stemmingfrom impaired immune responsesor inadequate medication adherence.<br>





 * Drug Loading Capacity:* Up To Two Hundred Thousand Molecules Of Antibiotic Per Nanophage And Sustained Release Profile Over Six Hours For Combating Intracellular Parasites From Promastilgoid Cells Through Nanocomposites LoadedWith PoliomyxbIn An Alternative Therapy Against Cutaneous Lesions Caused By LEshmanias AmAmazonenses
