 Summary & Discussion


This paper describes, "Circulation Of Fileria Parasites’ MiRs Into Host Blood And Potential Diagnostic Utility"  and summarizes well. It provides detailed methodology steps alongwith results interpretation regarding circulant miRNas extracted From Dog PeripheralBlood With Evidence For Infective Species Identification Through Quantitative RTPCR Assay Development :



**Key Findings:**




• Large scale screening yielded numerous putative circulatory parasite related transcripts across diverse infector organisms like _Dirophillaimitisinfecteddogs,; revealing substantial diversity amongst individual specimens although shared conservation patterns emerged highlighting promising diagnostics possibilities.<br>   <BR/>      • High variations existedbetween replicates particularly concerning rare variants indicating challenges associated wtih quantifying extremely scarce nucleic acids precisely utilizing current methodologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<Br>< br />        





The manuscript clearly outlines future directions emphasizing validation approaches alongside addressing concerns surrounding standardization protocols designed specifically tailored towards improving accuracy& precision pertainingto newly implemented technologies utilized throughout investigations involving infectious agents.**
