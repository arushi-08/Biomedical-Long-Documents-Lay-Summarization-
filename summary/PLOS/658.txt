This text describes "Myelopoiesis, characterized alterations induced upon deletion  and overexpression. It provides detailed information regarding cellular organization factors controlling lipid metabolism via alteration involving Scruble -an integral transmembrane signaling regulator â€“ particularly focusing overexpressed modulators impacting various aspects related specifically towards MyELN synthesis downstream effects across diverse neurological disorders affecting lipids composition


**Key Findings:**   Inhibition Of SCRIBBLE decreases newly synthesized MYEln AND alters existing ones making synapses less stable since bipolar disorder model systems undergo substantial remodeling alongside schizophrenia pathology characteristic pathological inflammatory responses common among psychiatric illnesses
