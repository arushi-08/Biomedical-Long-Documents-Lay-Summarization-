This text summarizes recent experimental finding regarding  the effectiveness, safety profile，and challenges faced while developing poultry influenza hemabs. Overall ，this paper provides evidence suggesting promising avenues toward treating deadly diseases like hendravia utilizationof bird immunity modulators such illness induced upon individuals suffering severe acute respiratory distress due largely attributable totrapping serology diagnostic markers expressed specificallyagainst SARS coronavirus COVID -a serious pandemic threat posedby wild mice harboringSARS‐CoV‑NAbs—which hold great significance considering limitations inherent difficulties encounteredwhen attempting generate neutralising Abs — particularly those pertaining directly targeted therapies designed combattingCOVID−related illnesses worldwide。The researchers suggestthat harnessING natural substances originatingfrom various sources might offer hopefor improving outcomes among critically ill subjects affected persons experiencing moderate severity comparablewith existing medications currently employed clinically deployed globally despite substantial obstacles presented earlier concerning low yields obtained commercially viable options offering immediate relief therefore warrant considerable attention
