 Summary


This paper describes characterisation, distribution patterns  and possible functional implication relatednessof amplified ribosomal RNA fragments derived form various geographically diverse collections. Specifically focusing upon its application towards diagnosis purposes through amplification methods like Short cp b E / F Polymerase Chain Reaction(scPCPCR) designed specifically targetting kinetoplast basic helix hairpin structures commonly shared amongst members pf genus _LeISHMANIA_ particularly *Donavani* complexes,. Additionally highlighting variant forms exhibited across geographical locations along eastern coastlines bordering Red Sea basin countries namely North West And Southwest Ethiopians borders extending upcountryside toward Northeast Kenyas boundaries..   The objective pursued herein involve characterizing regional diversity reflected predominantly manifestinamplified segments extracted employing scCPBR methodology coupled wtihHRM profiling approaches implemented concurrently alongside traditional Sanger dideoxyribonucleicic Acid Sequencing methodologies employed routinely during laboratory investigations pertaining t parasitic infections encountered locally under field circumstances.<br>



**Key Findings:**<ol><li>- Variations exist betwenk amiplication profiles retrieved utilizing ScCpcr technology encompassing numerous haplotypes originating From Northwest AND SoutheastEthiopia with subgroups being delineated largely dependent Upon Geographic origins.</ li></ul>.




In conclusion，this investigation underscores significant variability displayed BY THE HaspB Repeat Region Across Various Geographical Regions Within Eastern Af rica With particular emphasis placed ON LEshmanias Donavanii Complex Members Found To Be Predominantly Distributed Throughout Northern WesternAnd Southwestern Ethopian Borders Bordering Northeastern kenya Through Examination OF Their Molecular Markers Such AS Inter Species Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Over Multiple RoundsOf Diagnostic Procedures Including Conventional Gel Electrophoresis Techniques Combined WITH HIGH Resolution Melt Profiling.(HRMP).
