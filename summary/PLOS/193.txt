**Overall:**   These researchers successfully characterized miRNAs associated wtih thermoregulation behavior changes induced hy Dimirhual infection causedby PeT Marmefhei across diferentgrowth stages ; however，the exact physiological significance remained unclear。They primarily focused mainly n transcript profiling rather thtan alternative approaches like proteomic techniques commonly employed when studying microrna interference systems involving mammalian tissues 。Although limited information exists concerning antifungal drugs acting directlyagainst pathogens ，this work provides substantial insight itowards understandingofDimilRA involvement iN pathogenicity modulation throughout microbial pathogenesis particularly focusing o ponthermaldimorphsmaspathogenicity involves transcriptional regulations governed byeithermiRs alongwith epigenetic alterations affecting host immune system responses．Therefore exploring additional avenues encompassing genomics coupled wiith drug design strategies might lead tothedevelopment effective treatmentsfor combating fungaiinfections
