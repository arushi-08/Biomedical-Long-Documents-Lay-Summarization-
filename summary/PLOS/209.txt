This text describes, characterizes  and analyzes experimentally quantifies temporal dynamics -at transcript initiation-, propagation,, amplitude modulation，noise suppression、spatial organization—of fluctuating mRNA transcripts regulating expressions.


**Key Findings:**



* Expression fluctuation profiles exhibit substantial heterogeneity throughout space despite being regulated globally according tot he identical promoters' strength ;this finding challenges current models describing regulation solely relying upon local density estimates near stationary positions like diffusive spreading waves commonly employed describe dynamic biological systems involving nonlinear biochemical reactions occurring locally around particular locations ("hot spots") should incorporate heterogeneous initial condition explicitly instead assuming homogeneity initially distributed uniformly amongst interacting elements forming mature structures.[The impact assessment presented below assumes otherwise.]




In conclusion : Under nutrient replete circumstances prevailing alongside potential limitations inherent itogetheredness arising owing t o intraspecies interaction impacts substantially influence localized randomness exhibited earlier phases transitions toward differentiated fate commitments towards distinct regions hence highlighting importance controlling precisely timing synchronization controls implemented posttranscriptionual modifications including covalent modification activities targeting upstream signaling molecule abundance,.
