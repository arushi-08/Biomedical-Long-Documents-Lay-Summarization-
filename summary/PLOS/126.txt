 Summary & Implications


This manuscript presents comprehensive epidemiology, entomology  and seroepidemiolology investigations aimed towards determining interrupting transmition ogOnchocercia Volvolus(O.V.)in southern Chiapaas Focus -Mexico,. It summarizes extensive work spanning severalyears covering various aspects related othe successful implementation odmass drug therapy programs designed specifically targeting reducing human infectioon due tthis disease causing organism known commonly assriver blindness "River Blindness". Here’S key takeaways :



**Transmission Interruptation:**   Based off thee latest investigation outcomes across different sampling periods encompassing numerous sites spread throuhgout teh SoutherrnChiapasFocus,, there exists substantial empirical proof suggesting complete interruptinooftransmission occuring naturally among humans residing therein.. Notably，no active infestation signs nor presence pfinfectivesflieswere documentedduring recentstudies implemented primarily focusing ontestingforinfection viaPCR techniques alongsideserologic assesment employingIgG antibody detections methods.<br>




 **Prevalence Reduction**: Overtime reductions innodules incaseshavebeen meticulously tracked alongwitha significant drop inomberalcaseswithin thistheSouthernChpapasfocus over  several decades,;demonstrating effective intervention strategies deployed locally tp combattingdisease burden.**
