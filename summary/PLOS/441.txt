 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes, identifies  novel miRNAs associatedwith Chinkungya vírus(CHIV)infection. Here’ s summarize key takeaways :



**Key Findings:**




• **Identification**: Researchers successfully identifed additional mirNases along side previously characterized ones across entire transcriptome changes induced via chichkngua infecionn innAealbpocibus singhs Cell Line model organism.. They discovered seventeen newly emerged micrornas whose expressions changed substantially following infction,. Additionally they validated experimentally selected candidate mRNA targests fo rthese emerging mikronnas confirming bioinformatics predictions.**     





 • Overexpression pf certain regulatory elements can lead tothe suppression if innate defenses leading researchers believethat altering ther balance betwen pro inflammatory responses versus antiinflammatory reactions plays pivotal rolw iththe pathology occuringduring infectious agents invasion**. Therefore future therapeutic interventions aimed towards regulating inflammation hold promise when combined wtih existing treatments designed t combatting virual replications.<br>







The current studay contributes valuable insights itowards comprehending complex relationship bwtween microscopic alterations occurring throughout illness progression causedby viursl infecton particularly highlighting thje significance o fmiCRNA networks underlying pathophysiology related tp human health challenges posed b ydiseaseslikechikugnyaa nd plasmodiuim where similar patterns emerge despite variations dervived form differnt tissues contexts.***
