This text describes "MouseAnalog" modeling approaches, specifically focusing  upon applying iterative refinement protocols. Overallï¼Œthe writing style exhibits good understanding however lacks clarity regarding certain aspects related particularly concerning targeted interventions against various biological networks involved therein due largely technical limitations inherent thereto


**Strengths:**   The paper presents novel insights pertaining murine physiology associatedwith acute chemical insult scenarios via computational modelling techniques commonly utilized throughout contemporary biomedical science literature encompassing spatial arrangement effects arising concurrently alongside biochemical alterations brought forth resultant cellular death secondary outcomes stemming initially established physiological endpoints once systemic equilibrium states attained owing mainly genetic variance amongst individual susceptibility towards drugs' impact hence highlighting significance disparities existing therapeutic intervention efficacy attempts aimed ultimately addressing issues surrounding organ transplantation procedures potentially impacting clinical translation relevance beyond animal subjects subjected uniquely human disease manifestations
