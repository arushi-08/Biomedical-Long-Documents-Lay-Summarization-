 Summary & Conclusion  


This manuscript describes optimization, characterization，and potential utility assessment against human pathogenic organisms. Two newly designed retrotranslocation inhibiting analogues based upon natural Product CompoundRetro_Two(Retro)were examined extensively throughout course work conducted across diverse systems involving Axonic parasitic worms' proliferation alongside inflammatory modulation inside hosts harborING LEISHMANIA spp.. Through detailed investigations employing biochemical techniques combined With functional assessments utilizing primary immune system models representative Of Human pathology,, researchers demonstrated increased effectiveness Over Parent Drugretro _The finding provided herein offer promise regarding future therapeutics targeting similar pathways involved therein.**



**Key Findings:**   




* Optimized Retrosubstances inhibit intracellular spread And inflammation triggered By Protozoa InfectiOn MaCrocytes resulting ultimately leading TO THE decrease OF HOST DEFENSE RESPONSE AND PARASITE GROWTH IN Vivo.<br>    <BR/>     • Inhibition kinetics reveal distinct profiles among Compounds highlighting Their ability FOR DIRECTLY Killing Intraaxonically Repurposed Toxopobiae OR BY COMPLETELY REVERSAL pf Host Inflammatory Response AFTER DRUG Treatment <Br>.      These Observations bolster existing information suggesting THAT THIS Class O F DRUGS HAS GREAT THERAPEUTIC INDEX BUT require further investigation Into Clinical Applications Given THEIR ACTIVITY AGAINST HUMAN PATHOGENS LIKE HIV AS WELL ASTHEIR SAFETY profile WITH LOW Toxicity Against Mammalian CELL Lines
