 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes transcript Profiling Of Peripheral Blood Cells During Acute And Chronic Phase Illness DueTo Severe Versus NonSevere ManifestationsOf Denue Fever Virus Infections. Here, researchers aimed  to characterize global alterations occurring throughout various stages—acute vs chronic phases —of moderate dENGUE FEVER AND SHOCK SYNDROME(DSS) caused BY DENRVA VIRUS IN NICARAGUA USING TRANSCRIPT PROFILING OF PERIPHERAL BLOOD CELLS FROM PATIENTS WITH DIFFERENT CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS BUT SIMILAR SEROTYPE PREVALENCE FOR THE STUDY PERIOD.. They hypothesized THAT HOST RESPONSE TO THIS PATHOGEN MAY BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD THROUGH ANALYSIS THAN CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS BECAUSE THEY REFLECT ONLY PARTIAL CHANGES AFTER SIGNIFICANT ALTERATION HAS ALREADY OCCURRED OR ARE NOT SUITABLE AS EARLY BIOMARKERS DURING ACUTE ILLNESS WHEN IT IS MOST NEEDED,. Their key finding suggests That altered hepatic function appears central tothe pathology differentiating mild symptomatic COVID -HIVE RELATED HOSPITALIZATION VS NONSYMPTOMATIC HEALTHY CONTROL GROUPS WHILE BOTH CONDITIONS SHARE SOME COMMON FEATURES LIKE INCREASED PURINE METABOLismAnd DOWNREGULATION IF SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION Pathways
