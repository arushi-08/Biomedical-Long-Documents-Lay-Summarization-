 Summary & Conclusion


This report describes successful implementation, safety profile  and potential benefits over existing therapies like Intralesinal Antimonial Injection Therapy. Its key takeaways includes :



**Treatment:**   The combination modality comprising Bipolar High Frequency ElectroCautery(EC) alongside Moist Wound Treatment-( MWt), incorporating Sodium Chlorotetrasodium Oxide,(DACN O)-treated Polyacrylic Acid Hydrogels exhibits promising efficiency across various aspects pertaining specifically towards accelerating wounded tissues recovery while minimizing scarring issues arising primarily because excessive inflammation plays havoc upon damaged skins affected predominantly owing largely thanks tothe parasitic burden imposed onto compromised integumentary barriers.. Additionally,,the utilization o fthis technique offers distinct advantages considering affordability accessibility despite limitations inherent therein regarding resource constraints prevalent particularly amidst developing nations,. Ultimately proving itself capable enough reducing reliance heavily placed solely relying exclusively conventional medication approaches employed locally thus far., although prospective investigations involving considerably bigger cohorts must confirm identical trends witnessed herein so definitive conclusions may draw closer scrutiny once available.;




* **Primary Objective**: Evaluate efficacies comparative performance assessment encompassing diverse endpoints ; Healing Time Reduction Through Combined Procedure Versus Standard Practice And Safety Profile Assessment Over Extended Follow Up Duration Within An Endemic Country Setting Such That Afghaniatan Where Infrastructures Are Limited But Resources Scarce Hence Forthcoming Treatments Must Be Affordable Yet Effective Against Chronic Skin Lesions Resulting Prominent DisfigureMENT AND Functional Impairment Caused By Cutaneous Leprosy Infections Leading TO Ulcers Which Can Last Years Or Even Decades If Left Untreated While Promoting Tissue Regeneration Via Electrical Stimulation Techniques Like Ec Causing Significant Damage Upon Tissues Consequently Increasing Risk Factors Associated Therwith Including Relapse Rates Post Completion OF Initial Therapeutic Intervention So Rapidly Eradicating These Pathogenic Agents Is Imperatively Necessary.**
