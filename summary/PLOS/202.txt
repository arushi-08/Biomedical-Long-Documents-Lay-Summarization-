The provided paper describes discoveries concerning transcript cleavage, specifically targeting mechanisms employed during transcriptional activation. Although much progress towards understanding molecular processes regulating various aspects remain unclear although potentially important since alterations made upregulation through phosphorylation events leading ultimately controlling key regulatory elements
