 Summary:  Chlamadia Trachoma Tussain Proteins Induce Histon Methyl Transfer Activity, Leading Potential Host Cell Reprogramming


This paper describes discovery & characterization of "nuclear export factor" ("Noire") encoded BY _Salmonella typhimurium_- like organisms. Notably，this article identifies NoIRE’S capacity beyond simply exporting factors; specifically Its capability toward altering hosts` immune systems utilizing direct modulation Of HOST HISTONES!



**Key Findings:**    




* **In Vitro Activities**: NOIR exhibits intrinsic HAT activities upon diverse Core Human Homologous Group IIb Class IV Set Domain Containing Enzymes From Various Species Including Humans And Other Mammals But Not Fish Or Plants.<br>    The primary objective OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY AND CHARACTERIZE THE FIRST DIRECT EFFECTOR PROTEIN THAT IS SECRETED FROM CHLAMYDIA BUT HAS BEEN FOUND IN OTHER GRAMNegativebacteria.**<p/>





•	NORE interacts With Multiple Substrates Beyond Just Mammalian Chromocromats—It Also Targets Nonhost Factors Such AS Viral Fusion Factor VectORS That Play Roles At Different Cellular Locations Than Their Native Sites On Transmembrane Structures Found Only Inside Cells.*** <BR><Br />







 * Overexpression OR Knockdown Experiments Demonstrrated Increased Levels AFTER OVEREXPRESSION FOR EACH TARGET EXCEPT ONE NONHOST CELLULAR SUBSTRATE--An Observation NOT Previously Reported Against ANY RELATED HUMAN PATHOGENS.*






***Additional Notes *** :     ﻿These observations offer insights Into How InfectING Microorganisms Can ModuloHost Gene Regulation Through Direct AlterATIONOf PosttranscriptionAL Modifications ON Critical Components Associated WITH EPIGenetic Mechanisms---Specifically Those RelatedTo HOx Genes.--Therefore understanding HOW microbial virulencefactors exploit biochemical pathways involved regulating transcription represents promising avenuesFor Developing Novel Therapeutics Strategies aimedAt Restoring Balance Between Immune ResponseAnd Tissue Damage Throughout Infections
