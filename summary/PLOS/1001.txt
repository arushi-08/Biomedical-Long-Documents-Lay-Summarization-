This text describes, summarizes  the finding. Here're my primary concerns - namely understanding various factors influencing visually guiding behavior exhibited collectively called "visual working" provided examples involving rodents & humans despite extensive prior work highlighting primarily upon mammalian vision system dynamics versus pathways employed specifically designed uniquely toward odor detection abilities utilized mainly fish instead human subjects participating actively engagements frequently deployed against predators successfully employing olfactionory senses combined representations formed due solely relying heavilyupon innate circuitry dedicated exclusively serving sense organs situated deep inside specialized areas restricted domain â€“ albeit incomplete yet demonstrably useful insights regarding object recognition processes occurring naturally whilst travelling freely amongst heterogeneous terrain utilizing multisensory pathway design incorporated therein alongside numerous behavioral responses commonly displayed among mammals
