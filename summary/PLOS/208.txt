 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes  the application, implementation，and validation of dynamic epidemic spread Models. They describe their novel methodology involving combining existing datasets alongwith Mathematical Modeling techniques aimed specificallyat determining optimuldosagefor vaccinations.. Their primary objectives include quantifying protectiomn conferred upon diverse populations via varied dosages administered concurrently alongside assessing associated morbidities arisingfrom said dosage variations.<br>
