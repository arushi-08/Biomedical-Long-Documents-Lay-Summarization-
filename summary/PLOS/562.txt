This text describes "The Enidemiology, Distribution & Population Estimates  forPlasmodiumviva x Parasitic Infection Across Human Populations" written By Christopher J. Dye*, Daniel L.; Smithuis F., James D.' 'Bloomfield T'. Please find my feedback regarding your manuscript :


**Strengths:**



* **Comprehensive overview**: Providesa thorough description encompassing various topics including methodology employed while presenting novel mappings highlighting plasmodiuma vivax endency alongside estimations pertaining tothe infected populace distributedworldwide..   It covers numerous facets like geography，biology、epidémiology 、transmission dynamics etc.., offering valuable perspectives uponthe complex interplaybetween humansandthis parasitic organism.<br>




• Comprehensive analysis - Covers multiple dimensions rangingfrom basic Epidemiology&distribution tountil advanced modeling methodologies deployedin assessing vulnerability profiles.&nbsp;- Offers insightful comparisonswith previous iterations focusing specificallyonP._falciparium_ emphasizing disparities encounteredwhen dealing wtih differing sporozoa behavior,& pathologyassociated variables impacting infectivity versus severity manifestations,.<p/>





***Areas requiring improvement:*







While addressing vast portions concerning endemism scenarios involving _S_. vivaX,, certain sections still call forextensive improvements:<li>- Lack clarity surrounding assumptions underpinningcertain interpretations.--For instance limitations inherent itobserved vs actual infectiousness shouldbe addressed.(e g., qPCR confirmation) </ li>< br>.






Overall despite commendable attempts undertaken toward comprehensively outlining existing circumstances relatingt o p Vivaxa ndits ramifications vis àvis publichealth concerns,;there’ s room fo r refinement especially considering ongoing advancements achievedwithin fielddeployments.**
