 Summary & Conclusion


This paper investigates whether bonemarrow derived Mesenchymal StemCells  (BMMSC) might help reduce scarring associatedwith Paraccoccidiabrasiliense Infection. Here, BMSCS had opposite effects depending upon timing â€“ increasing scar production instead decreasing its presence like conventional antifibrosis medications did successfully demonstrate efficacy reducing scars during early stages yet failing later due lack thereof effectiveness over extended periods.. Despite showing promise initially however ultimately proving ineffective overall,, researchers believe combining MSC based therapeutics alongside existing medication holds great future possibilities particularly regarding cost effective interventions targeting advanced stage fibroses caused primarily amongst impoverished populations living predominantly across developing nations affected disproportionately high rates throughout latin america,.
