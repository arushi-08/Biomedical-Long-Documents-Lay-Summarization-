**Summary:**   In recent years，therehasbeen considerable interest regarding understanding mechanisms underlying chronic intestinal inflammation involving mucosal barrier dysfunction resulting due totheyecorrectors derivedfrom gut microbiome organisms particularly Escherichia coli infection models based offullerenal immunity modulation strategies designed towards treating Inflammatory Bowel Disease(IBDs) ; however little information concerning te mechanism whereby TLR signaling pathway modulates host defense remain elusive despite extensive investigations undertaken thusfar too long,. Despite challenges encountered while studying i ntegrating signal transduction events occurring downstream intracellular signals initiated following engagementwith ligands deliveredby Toll Like Receptorslectins—this paper presents unique characteristics displayed across diverse microbes residing inside humans highlighting possible therapeutic avenues employing engineered systems biology approaches toward combating infections arising becauseof said organism..
