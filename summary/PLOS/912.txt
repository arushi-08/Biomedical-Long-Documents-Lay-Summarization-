 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes, comprehensively explores  the unique immunosuppressive mechanism utilized through extracellular matrix metallopeptidase ANXA. Specifically focusing within systemic lupus erythematoosus(SLE) pathology where dysregulations lead pathological manifestations involving microbial invasion alongwith inadequate hosts defenses resulting eventually lethal complications despite antimicrobial interventions designed specifically targeted towards combating infectious organisms.. Researchers discovered substantial impairment exists when employing traditional therapies aimed solely focused toward pathogen elimination alone thereby highlighting alternative avenues required alongside conventional therapeutics tailored explicitly addressing abnormal physiological imbalances driving detrimental changes seen throughout SLE lesions across different anatomical compartments affected predominantly kidneys among others,. Their discovery holds promise since they pave way forward exploring innovative therapy paradigms capable tackling widespread destruction witnessed clinically presenting individuals battling autoimmune challenges arising directly linked back onto metabolic homeostasis disruption stemming initially triggered potent triggers initiating overwhelming destructive chain reactions characteristic often encountered amidst advanced stage illness experienced amongst afflicted subjects suffering greatly owing partly attributed poor management practices implemented routinely adopted widely today
