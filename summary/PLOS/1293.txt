This manuscript describes novel insights regarding  The use, highlighting two potent antimicrobial peptides derived primarily targeting cellular immunity. While previous reports describe antibacterial peptide therapeutics designed towards controlling infectious diseases highlight some interesting features like biofilm biofilms formed mainly focused around promoting healing process involves understanding certain regulatory elements employed predominantly targeted therapies based off individual differences across numerous pathologies where they act effectively regulate homeostasis., potentially offering promising candidate treatments
