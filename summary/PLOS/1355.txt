 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript explores mechanisms through  which nuclear localization affects Gene Expression. They investigate, primarily focusing upon transcript ion regulations involving RNA polymerase II targeting onto transcribed targets called lyrphins – mainly transcripts encoding immunosuppressive molecules important regulators include AMl_la along WITH LYRPHIN D AND H ligands OF THE Killer Cell Receptor Complex CDLYL ALLOGENE EXPRESSIONS FOR EACH MEMBER ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERING PATTERNS THAT REFLECT THEIR UNIQUE FUNCTION BUT SHARE SOME COMMON FEATURES RELATED DIRECTly tO BINDINGS BY OTHER Transcription Factor Binding Sites FOUND IN PROMOTERS AS WELL HAS NONPROMOTOR SEQUENCE MOTIFS NOT FAR FROM START CODONS AT LOW LEVELS (~ − promoter).
