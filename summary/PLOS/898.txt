 Summary & Significance  


This manuscript describes, comprehensively yet concisely，the transcriptional landscape alterations within pregnant rodent uteri challenged either experimentally ("K" isolate) versus clinically acquired (“VD”) isolates. Notably highlighting key players potentially contributing towards limiting vertical transfer across species barriers inherent throughout gestation period.. Here summarizes highlights include ;



**Key Findings:**   




* **Differential transcript modulation**: Significant alteration patterns involving various categories including "secretatory granules", interferon gamma responsiveness,, Transcription factors like STAT signalling components alongside decreased apoptotic activity characterize contrasting outcomes achieved due solely employing diverse infecting organisms despite similar infectivity rates amongst offspring delivered prematurely under experimental circumstances.<br>        ﻿





 * Higher burdens exhibited greater propensity toward invading vessels serving placenatal circulation resulting ultimately impacting nutrient exchange dynamics thereby influencing embryo viability prior reaching developmental stages crucial foe proper formation hence promoting embryonic abnormalities commonly encountered concurrently.(e g., microcephaly).






The current investigation offers valuable insights regarding innate immunity deployed specifically targeting extracellular bacteria residing primarily inside epithelial lining layers covering reproductive organs thus paving way future avenues exploring novel therapeutic targets capable controlling systemic spread stemming directly off primary sites harboring infective agents particularly beneficial minimizing risks linked vertically transmitting diseases worldwide
