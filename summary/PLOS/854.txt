This paper presents  a novel Computational Framework Based On gaussian Processes With Applications TO SpatioTemporal Prediction Of Infective Diseases. Here' s summarizes key takeaways :



**Main Findings:**




* **Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) outperformed Random Forests Regressor And Boosted Trees AlgorithmÂ in forecasting.** While traditional approaches like Randomized Forest Registerer, Boosting Tree Classifier often struggle while dealing non linear relationships amongst inputs variable - outputs ones ; Gaussain Processeess offer significant advantages through flexibility offered via kernels enabling them handle intricate connections effectively..   The improved accuracy resulted primarily attributed superior capacity handling complicated correlations arising across space/time dimensions inherent many contagious illnesses,.    In contrast although easy implementations exist employing ensemble techniques including randomized forest regressors AND boosting decision treets; however,, incorporating sophisticated covariance structures proved challenging given large datasets involving thousands upon thousand observations commonly experienced during epidemics situations where accurate forecasts hold paramount significance.., therefore highlighting benefits associated wtih utilizing advanced methodologies tailored specifically address complexities involved therein.<br>
