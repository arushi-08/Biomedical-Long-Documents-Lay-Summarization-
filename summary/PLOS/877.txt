 Summary  of Findings :


This manuscript describes detailed investigations exploring Central Carbon Metabolism Changes During Different Stages Of Malarial Infection. Key highlights include,



**Metabolic shift:** There' ; substantial alterations within carbohydrate usage patterns among diverse plasmodial phases – shifting dominance toward intermediate carbons like malonyl‐glyceraldehyde rather thtan directly utilizing carbohydrates despite continued heavy glycose intake highlighting unique adaptations employed against nutrient scarcity encountered inside definitive tissues..   The primary fuel shifted away includes glycogen breakdown product glycerone alongside concurrent elevation pf oxaloacetate confirming extensive diversion fluxes occurring outside conventional hepatic tissue sites characteristic mainly amongst late liver invasive organisms,. Additionally,, altered lipid profiles reveal enhanced unsaturated fat deposition potentially contributing significantly tothe establishment och early invasion processes underlying tumorigenesis particularly amidst immune evasion mechanisms deployed uniquelyby cancer stemcells.,




 **Glutamate becomes dominant amid changing landscape**: Within certain parasitic worms displaying intricate feeding behaviors designed specifically tailored around maximizing resource acquisition irrespective environmental constraints., switching gears entirely relies heavily utilize readily metabolizeable aminoacid—glutathione instead relying extensively.,. Through comprehensive profiling techniques employing advanced molecular tools combined wtih sophisticated analytical methodologies encompassing untracers coupled wiht biochemical assays.., researchers gain deeper insights regarding dynamic interplay betwen organism physiology nad ecological adaptation leading twards understanding disease progression models applicable tp humans facing severe challenges posed b y pathogens possessing remarkable resilience capabilities.,,
