 Summary & Conclusion


This paper describes discoveries regarding  the newly discovered role played   by "UBTR" alias “kiaaa” family member, specifically focusing primarily    on neuronal development. Key takeaways :



**Key Findings:**




* Overexpression Of UBTr leads suppression colonies forming ability across different cancerous models indicating potential therapeutic targets against tumours..  (Fig.**)





•	Ubtr plays key regulators MTOr signalling leading ultimately impacting neural developments like learning behaviour changes.(Figs**.).






﻿In conclusion,,,,, ubtoer appears essential regulator controlling intracellular processes involving inhibition signals associated wtih MTORC inhibitors commonly employed treating several types ocancerous disease states,. Therefore understanding molecular details underlying utbr' s impact would pave way towards developing innovative therapies targeting related metabolic networks
