 Summary  of "A mathematical modelling approach applied...":


This paper describes mathematically modelled patterns, describing recurring Transmission OF rift valley Fever Disease(RVFD)in rural communities situated amidst mountains. Here’S summarized overview highlights critical aspects discussed therein:-



**Study Area:** Temperate & Mountainious Highlands -Madagascar   The primary subject involves investigating factors influencing repeated occurrences involving bovine pathogen dissemination across various landscapes encompassing rivers alongside settlements throughout northern portions extending upcountryside slopes towards elevated terrains featuring dense vegetation cover comprising primarily paddy cultivation zones along riverbanks serving numerous villagers engaged actively trading via marketplaces established far away.<br><p/> **Objective**: Understand circumstances contributing toward ongoing prevalence trends pertaining specifically targeting wildlife reservoirs commonly harborING viruses like rabies AND Ebola concurrently impacting individuals residing nearby.**<P />




***Key Findings ***





• Models illustrate successful replication behavior concerning actual epidemiology trend highlighting dominant contribution stemming directly FROM DIRECT transmissions BETWEEN ANIMALS coupled WITH THE HIGH ABUNDANCE FOR MOSQUITOES DURING DRY PERIOD BUT LOW TEMPERATURE CONDITIONS THAT LIMIT THEIR ACTIVITY AFTER EACH FLOODED RICE TRANSPLANTATION OR WHEN FIELDS ARE NOT YET FULLY COVERed BY WATER BECAUSE THIS IS MAINLY RELATED TO VILLAGE LOCATIONS AS WELL HAS DISTANCE From RIVERSIDE AREAS WHERE VECTORS NORMALLY REST AT NIGHTTIME.***






 • Highlighted limitations include inadequate representation regarding clustered nature inherent particularly With respect certain geographic features present Within STUDY AREA resulting potentially biased outcomes although attempts made mitigating bias proved insufficient.(e..g., assuming random biting behaviors).







--- Overall Significance --- Although environmental variables contribute significantly limiting widespread infectivity owing largely limited insect activity predominantly confined mostly AROUND EVENING hours following sunset till dawn,(i,.a.., dusk), socioeconomic activities centered round agriculture involve regular interaction Between people And domesticated herbivores thereby increasing opportunities encounters exposing vulnerable groups prone contracting diseases transmitting agents readily accessible THROUGH TRADE routes connecting remote locales frequently frequented traders engage regularly therefore enhancing risks posed considerably closer proximity residential centers offering easy access transportation networks linking diverse regional hubs together facilitate movement possibilities enabling rapid expansion coverage distances beyond immediate vicinity surroundings ;-this underscores significance placed onto vigilance efforts geared safeguarding public safety effectively addressing challenges presented uniquely unique environments encountered here
