This text describes "Matt",  an algorithmic framework developed primarily focused upon improving accuracy, especially regarding flexible molecular complexes.


**Key takeaways:**   The primary contribution offered up frontMATT incorporates significant improvements achieved via bending potential energy penalties during various types pf complex formation processes involving numerous closely interacting components ; thereby enabling accurate identification across diverse evolutionary relationships amongst macromolecules without compromising spatial arrangement precision delivered earlier models built off relatively modest numbers (~upward hundreds) crystallographic snapshots representative o f specific domain architectures implemented utilizing prior techniques employed widely today despite limitations intrinsic thereto - mainly stemming fron excessive computation cost considerations pertaining tyo larger scale systems.. Additionally,, MATT facilitates rapid assessment fo homologies betwen disparate tertiary arrangements arising froma wide array oft heighly diverged replicates,.
