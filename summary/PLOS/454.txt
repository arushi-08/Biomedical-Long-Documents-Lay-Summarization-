The primary focus revolves around understanding mechanisms employedbypathogenic yeastsurviving hostile environments particularly focusingontheir capacity tominvade humans brains causing severeinfections called cerebral candidiasis(alsoknown asthe thirdleadingcause death amongst immunocompromisedindividuals). Withholding substantial promise regarding alternative therapies currently available there exists urgency ito develop effective strategies combatthese formidable organisms effectively.,.
