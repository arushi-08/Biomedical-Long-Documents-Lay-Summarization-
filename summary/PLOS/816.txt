 Summary & Conclusion


This well written manuscript describes challenges faced whilst attempting  to accurately assess asymptomatic infeciton. Here'a summarized key takeaways :



**Main Findings:**   




* Serum sampling provides insufficient IgM, making diagnoses unreliable even though many subjects maintain consistent positives through repeated testing via qPCR over extended periods..    The majority (~two thirds) show seropositivity but do exhibit minimal detectable parasitic load upon microscopic inspection highlighting potential issues related solely relying heavily just offserolgy versus definitive diagnostics like invasive tissue examinations involving biopsies etc...     It emphasizes need fir alternative approaches beyond traditional methodologies employed thusfar,.

In spite limitations inherent ito current detection systems,,,,,the utility employing multiple biomarkers concurrently enhances overall efficacy considerably improving coverage reaching up tp nearly ¾thrds pf afflicted persons albeit still leaving room fo improvement moving forward.<br>
