 Summary & Analysis  


This paper describes variations, similarities. It compares pediatric vsAdult dengueage related issues based upon retrospective analyses involving various aspects like demographics，clinical symptoms、laboratory parameters etc., extracted through extensive observations conducted via longitudinal sampling techniques implemented specifically designed towards understanding dynamics pertaining exclusively tothe infected populations residing locally near Southern Vietnams largest teaching facility—HospitalforTropical Disease(HTDD). With its comprehensive design incorporating diverse demographic categories alongwith meticulous attentionto medical histories coupled against standardized treatments administered concurrently under expert guidance,,thisstudy provides valuable insightsinto managing complex scenarios arising amidst evolving epidemiologyofthedisease globally..



**Key Findings:**   




* **Children exhibit disproportionate susceptibility toward Severe Vascular Leakage**: Despite displaying milder initial symptom profiles relative tousexadults,.children often sufferfrommore intense hemorrhagic manifestation leading eventually toshock occurrence thereby highlighting inherent vulnerabilities stemming formtheir immature vasculature system combined wtih compromised homeostasis capabilities.<br>  





 * An elevated incidence rate amongst younger kids underscores concerns surrounding widespread transmission especially considering vulnerability linked tp congenital disorders affecting clotting pathways resulting potentially fatal consequences even post recovering fully.(See figure titled "Platelets Counts".)
