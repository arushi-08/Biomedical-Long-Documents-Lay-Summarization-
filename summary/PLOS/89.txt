 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes,  forthefirst timereports successful applicationof ribo switch targeted therapeuticsagainst staphylococcus Aureus. They discoveredthat guanidine derivative named pc_I exhibits promising antibacterialactivity selectively towards _Staphylocccus aurues_, thereby providing evidenceto exploitribosome -binding inhibitorsas effective treatments againtsubsistenceinfections..



**Key Findings:**




* **Selective Targeting**: Compound PCs primarily exertsitsbacteridalactionby interferingwithguaanineribosome complexes ratherthan broadly interacting withembryonictargets like ribosomal proteins,. Its selectivity makesit particularly attractive candidate forexploiting microbial vulnerabilitieswithout compromisinghost safety.` 





•	The effectivenesswas validated utilizing diverse approachesincluding laboratory assays involving culturedbacteria,, tissue extracts,,,animalmodels mimickingmastittis inflammation，And pharmacokineticstudies demonstratingtherapeuticefficacy within living organisms。
