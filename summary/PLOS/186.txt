 Summary & Analysis


This manuscript describes investigations exploring transcript abundance, tissue distribution viaWhole Mount  In Situ Hybridisation(WISH) assays), evolution conservation amongst different lifecycle phases. Additionally explores possible utility towards future therapeutic avenues involving modulation specifically targetting germinal populations..
