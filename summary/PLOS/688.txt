This manuscript describes finding about  the crucial contribution made throughout innate defense mechanism employed primarily, targeting cellular processes downstream. Through experimental approaches employing infectious agents designed specifically towards addressing COVID‐inhibited illness outcomes achieved successful therapeutic intervention strategies aimed reducing systemic responses characteristically linked alongside SARS‑CoV entry route pathophysiology secondary bacterial invasion process driven predominantly intracellularly pathogenic bacteria growth inhibitory action taken place inside hosts subjected particularly vulnerable individuals suffering respiratory distress brought forward genetic disorders connectedness,. Given current challenges surrounding pandemic scenarios there exists great promise regarding harnessING natural antivirulence therapy options based offshootings derived out come across numerous illnesses encompassing microbial assault systems utilized widely spread worldwide currently ongoing global health crisis arising concurrently With increasing incidence globally since late years ago several decades back then again highlighting just recently emerged potent therapies focused around controlling widespread outbreaks stemming From emerging pathogens impacting humans frequently encountered clinically challenging situations
