 Summary & Conclusion


This paper describes epidemiological characteristics, risks assessment  and mapping serum antibody prevalance against rift valley Fever viruses(RVV) across various ecological landscapes. Two primary aims achieved : identifying environmentally risky locations conducive either directly transmitting pathogens via close interactions involving shared spaces like barns housing sick cows ("direct" mode), transmitted primarily when handling freshly extracted dairy produce (“indirect“mode). Secondly assessing whether existing diagnostic tools accurately reflect actual viral burden throughout diverse habitats present challenges given limited reporting systems particularly regarding indirect modes transmition leading sometimes inaccurate representation hence hindering effective management strategies development..



**Key Findings:**




* **High Seroprevelence**: Overall cowserology revealed relatively widespread yet unevenly distributed infectiomn pattern amongst surveyed communities highlighting complex interplay betwen ecology geography terrain suitability harboring specific types pf mosquitos serving als intermediate hosts alongside prevailing weather conditiona nd vegetation cover influencing pathogen dissemination mechanisms,.   The highest levels occured predominantly around coastal lowlands subject t o regular flooding coupled wtih dense settlements showcasing vulnerability even amidst ongoing interventions implemented post recent crisis events occuring elsewhere.; 





 * Cowseropositivity increases exponentially wiht increasing agel demonstrating sustained residual protection conferred upon recovery although exact mechanism underlying acquired immune memory remains unclear.**
