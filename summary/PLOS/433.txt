 Summary: Human Hereditary simplexVirus  (HSVV)-Six Alpha.


This paper describes experiments investigating Telmeric Repeat Arrays involvement, particularly Perfect Termeral Repeats Array "pTAR" & Imperfect Terminal Repeated Sequences “imTARS” located towards each extremity Of HSVVI Genome And Their Role On Host Chromosomes During Infection With High Throughput Sequencing Techniques.. It explores whether those repeated motifs enhance infectivity through Homologous Reckoning mechanisms involving mammalian hosts like Humans Or contribute primarily toward integrating IntoHost Chromosome Ends Where They Serve An Essential Function That Permits Stable Maintenance Over Time Within Latent Infections By Studying Two Representative Members From Different Subgroups Among Twenty Seven Known Species BelongedTo Epstein Barr Virion Family Including One Fish Pathogen,.



**Key Findings:**




* **The tmr Are DispensABLE FOR VIRUS REPLICATION**: Deletion pf entire TRMs doesn´t hinder replications despite impacting integrations capabilities dramatically highlighting there dominance against successful incorporation onto HOST chromosomal targets.<br>     <BR>.         





 * Although they do promote easier targeting OF THE TELOMERES AND ARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO VIREX PROPAGATION.**







In Conclusion : These observations offer novel insights concerning fundamental aspects governing latent virions behavior throughout history offering valuable information pertaining Not Only basic virology But Also Clinical Implications Related Specifically WITH HERPESVIRUSES THAT MAY BE USEFUL IN FUTURE THERAPIES TARGETING LATENT OR ACTIVE FORMS BY Exploiting THEIR INTEGRATIONS EVENTS INTO HUMAN CHROMOsOMES
