 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes, identifies  microRNAS(MiRs) derived specifically formthe salviaof female _Ae.alb opicta_mosquitoess under laboratory condition through next -generation Sequencing technology combinedwith computational analysis approaches,.The majority (~>Â seventy%) Of newly discoverd MiRsaffectively inhibit chimeric yellow fever Virus type I infectiomn tissue culture models representing early stage pathogenesis events occurring directly inside hosts' bodies.. Although some changes occurrs throughout inflammation resulting primarily From cellular damage caused By virion attachment And entry mechanisms employedby retroviruses,, little impacton overall systemic pathology appears limited largely confined locally around wound healing processes initiated shortly efter injury occcurrence.,Therefore understanding molecular mechanism underlying innateimmune responses triggered During acute phase Infection will require additional investigation beyond scope ifthis particular work.., Despite limitations inherent challenges presented., identifying miRS targeting platforms capableOf mitigating pathological outcomes holds promise since recent discoveries suggest promising therapeutic avenues involving manipulation OF said molecules hold great hopefor developing effective treatments Against viruseinfections particularly concerning dengue haemorrhagicfever.(Abstract).
