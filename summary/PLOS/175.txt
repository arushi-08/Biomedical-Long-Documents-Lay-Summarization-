The text describes, among others. Overallï¼Œthis paper presents original discoveries concerning  the potential therapeutic targets identified throughout cancer biology where understanding mechanisms underpinning tumor progression remain elusive despite substantial advances accomplished toward improved therapies relying primarilyon inhibition kinetics constantstimulation dynamics exhibitedby many oncogene promoters ; hence highlighting possible avenues employing them alongside clinical efficacy trials currently underway
