 Summary  and Relevance


This paper describes, Backpack Polymerase Chain Reaction (" BackPack qPCR ") -a newly devised technique aimed toward improving accessibility. And affordability limitations faced during existing Molecular Xenomontoring(MX) approaches employed against lympathic filiarisis.(LF). By combining quick yet accurate nucleic acid isolation procedures based solely sodium hydroxide solution,(NaOH), alongside user friendly polymerase chainreaction platforms like MiniPCRs™, back packqPCR offers portability across challenging terrains where specialized lab equipments might otherwise hinder progress.<br>



**Key Findings:**<li>-backpack_Polymerease ChainReaction_(backPACK\_qCR)_can efficiently extract genetic material even under adverse circumstances.</ li><ul>. <BR/>   The efficacy achieved via BACKBACK qcr parallels traditional columns utilized widely throughout labs worldwide despite being considerably cheaper (<$US$) </LI></ol>, making accessible diagnosis attainable locally instead relying heavily centralized facilities far away form affected communities..




* **Sensitivity**: Successfully detecting down t o Single larvae infected Mosquitoes Upto Pool Size Limitlessness (~up tp n= twenty five individuals.) With ease thanks tot he utilization OF THE MINIPCCR™.





 * Cross reactivity observed Between brugjia Species necessitates Further Validation Before Deployment Within Endemic Locations.**







Overall,,the introduction pf _BacpacK_-QCP represents advancement beyond previous attempts targeting affordable solutions geared specifically around diagnosing infectious diseases prevalent among populations residing deep rooted amidst hostile environments characterized inadequate infrastructural capabilities,.
