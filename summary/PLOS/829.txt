 Lay Summary:


This paper describes ongoing, subclinical riftsvalley Fever Virus  (RVV) infections within Eastafrica’S Kililomber River Flood Plain. Here summarizes key points :



**Main Findings:**     - Seroreactivity rates observed across various ages suggest continuous intraepidemiological spread despite lack symptoms presentation over time ; particularly noteworthy finding includes nine newly confirmed recently infective individuals amongst antibody positives highlighting possible sources contributing towards future resurgence should circumstances favor expansion given favorable ecological niche availability throughout much wider geographic areas encompassing multiple ecosystems like riversides & agricultural fields adjacent wetlands etc..       




The primary objective behind conducting regular surveys involving diagnostic tests designed specifically targeting immunoglobulin M proteins produced soonest efter natural recovery offers substantial benefits regarding epidemiological control measures implementation strategies tailored toward curtailting further spreading patterns once new waves emerge hence minimizing impacts potentially devastating livelihoods dependent heavily reliant agriculture sector activities around affected communities residing near flooded landscapes alongside vulnerable ecosystem habitats supporting breeding grounds conducive harborage growth leading ultimately impact food security stability regional economies depend greatly relyupon.<br>
