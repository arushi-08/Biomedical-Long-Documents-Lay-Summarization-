 Summary & Implications


This study systematically reviews existing publications regarding filoviridae, specifically focusing its effects upon bodily liquids. Its objective aims towards identifying potential sources capable transmitting infectivity via contaminated mediums outside bloodstream components like whole Blood Samples(BS). Although limitations persist concerning certain aspects pertaining mainly  the accuracy estimation involving newly diagnosed instances throughout diverse regions affected earlier along East African shores - notably Sierra Leone -, valuable insights emerge highlighting key points surrounding contagious nature amongst surviving victims' bodies once afflicted initially :   



**Key Findings:**




• **Blood**: Despite variability across assays employed – namely Tissue Culture versus Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction,( RTPCR)–– approximately half fewer subjects exhibit measurable quantities while displaying signs indicating recovery yet retain viable viruses inside them despite recovering health status ; hence increasing concern around residual shedding scenarios potentially impacting others nearby.<br> <BR><p/> • Non‐ BLOOD Bodily Fluids While possessing lower concentrations relative thereto—with exceptions—(such us salivary secretion), majority serological examinations conducted utilizing PCR reveal considerably higher rates positively confirming contamination thereby posing lesser threat unless directly contacting compromised tissues containing substantial amounts o f virual matter originating predominantly out od damaged skin surfaces rather then internal organs..
