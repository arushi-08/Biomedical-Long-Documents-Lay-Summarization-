 Summary  


This paper investigates historical, contemporary & projected dissemination across mainland SE. Of course，the manuscript includes extensive details regarding methodologies employed alongside comprehensive interpretations derived form various analytical techniques deployed therein.<br>



**Key Findings:**   




* **Sertype Dynamics**: Sertypes exhibit recurrent waves like oscillations seen historically - e g., decreases coinciding wtih newly arrived invasive haplotyes leading potentially substantial reductions nationwide infection levels via displacement effects induced locally once novel variants emerge elsewhere globally.. These observations align perfectly finew ith theoretical assumptions underpinning structured metapopulation frameworks commonly adopted t understand pathogen invasions involving sequential host species replacements often encountered concurrently worldwide,. Therefore highlighting possible utility employing advanced modelling tools designed expressly targeting multiscale interactions encompassing diverse biological systems comprising pathogens interacting directly wih hman populaions distributed unevenly geographically speaking,, particularly concerning highly contagious infectious agents whose impacts tend toward rapid expansion whenever opportunities arise.; 





The authors emphasize limitations inherent ito current investigations pertaining primarily centered solely onto genomics coupled wirht limited longitudinal epidemiology datamand highlight alternative avenues open fo exploration moving forward related tot eh subject matter addressed herein.--
