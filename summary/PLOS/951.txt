 Summary & Relevance


This paper describes  the epidemiology, clinicopathology   and outcomes amongst hospitalized afebrid cases due either directly attributable diagnoses like lassy Virus Disease(LD) itself. It highlights key risk factor disparities across various presentations highlighting potential avenues towards improved early identification through screening strategies designed specifically targeting individuals displaying uncomplicated yet suspicious feverish patterns particularly amidst regions recognized historically prone toward LD outbreaks..



**Key Findings:**




* **Prevalence**: Although rare (<~ a third), Lasssa Feber Illness Diagnosis Syndrome' s incidence appears comparable globally when contrasted per capita rates observed locally throughout previous documented instances involving pediatric populations residing primarily confined geographically close proximity relative commonly affected nations -Sierra Leonne，Libertia And Guinee-. With regards specific demographics examined here however ; Nigerians tend exhibit considerably greater susceptibility accounting potentially upto six percent comprising approximately half being symptomatic concurrently experiencing seizures related predominantly attributed solely tot he condition rather convulsion secondary complications arising upon hospitalization resulting ultimately leading mortality figures slightly above average albeit failing short falling below established thresholds deemed acceptable according t international standards pertaining safety protocols implemented universally applicable regardless whether they involve pediatrics interventions tailored explicitly aimed combating microbial pathogens responsible primary contributing etiology behind most incidences prompting immediate intervention measures intended mitigating risks posed collectively encompassing neurological impairments stemming mainly cerebral dysfunctioning often characterized recurrently manifestating seizure activity frequently accompanied heightened inflammation localized exclusively restricted strictly intracranial compartments hence warrant prompt recognition coupled comprehensive treatment modalities geared expressly addressing systemic distress manifested prominently evidenced pathologically compromised immune responses exhibited disproportionately more pronounced manifestation accompanying concurrent dehydration culminating eventually demise despite therapeutic attempts employed promptly following confirmation utilizing molecular diagnostics tools capable accurately pinpointing causative agent irrespective individual variations encountered routinely experienced even amid identical epidemiological circumstances prevailing widely prevalent regional trends suggest implementation widespread surveillance programs focused meticulously identifying susceptible vulnerable segments population subgroups subject ongoing monitoring procedures ensuring timely initiation effective treatments minimizing fatalities linked back direct exposure hazardous environmental hazards inherent characteristic landscapes harborering substantial burden burdens placed squarely frontline healthcare practitioners operating therein serving pivotal roles safeguarding lives entrusted uniquely positioned professionals equipped adequately manage complex scenarios effectively navigate intricate decision making processes guiding them adeptness navigating delicate balance maintaining equilibrium precarious ecosystems balancing human vulnerability vulnerabilities intrinsic limitations confronting caregivers battling formidable adversaries relentlessly relentless determination combined forces deployed successfully combatting challenges faced daily confrontations adversity overcome obstacles hindering progress achieved thanks collaborative efforts anchored firmly rooted principles compassion empathy resilience fortitude perseverance
