 Summary  of Findings & Significance


This paper describes investigations aimed identifying molecular mechanisms underlying cellular defense mechanism employed throughout various stages, particularly early stage pathogenesis. Through transcriptional profiling conducted utilizing microarray technology combined subsequent functional analyses involving interferon gamma(IFN γ) signaling components like interleukin twenty Two,(IL)-Ilb along side numerous cytokines downstream mediators ; specifically focusing mainly onto Innominant Immune System modulators leading ultimately toward establishing robust safeguards encompassing diverse pathophysiological scenarios encountered through infections arising due course bacterial challenges posed directly targeting specific tissues affected predominantly susceptible hosts exposed initially compromised defenses deployed concurrently employing vaccinations designed mitigate detrimental outcomes stemming out resultant diseases afflicting individuals suffering Tuberculosis Infection.(TI).
