 Summary & Analysis


This manuscript describes  an optimised methodology ("titrating") employed successfully, specifically tailored towards establishing precisely -in vitro--the "limiting" Infectious Dose(LD) commonly referred.toas Average Infective Dosage Estimate Fifty Percent (“AIPED”) achievable through various dosages administered via intravitreal injection onto laboratory mice subjected initially immune suppression induced chemically,. Although primarily focused around mouse experimentation,, aspects discussed herein apply broadly toward diverse species subject matter experts deem necessary..



**Key takeaways:**   




* **Purpose**: Define AIPEd optimally utilizing reduced resource allocation whilst maintaining efficacy standards established previously implemented throughout numerous trials involving immunocompromised rodents like murine subjects.<br>    <li/> 	• Minimizing unnecessary suffering inherent therein.</LI><BR>.





 * Successfully validated technique utilizes mathematical modelling incorporating extensive parametric evaluations conducted concurrently alongside empirical validation assays employing real biological samples collected directly form targeted tissues extracted straight away live organisms.(e., blood).







In conclusion，this novel strategy offers substantial benefits compared traditional methodologies :






 • Significantly reduce overall participant count thereby decreasing expenditure incurred along side adverse events experienced inadvertently stemming largely attributable solely numerical variability intrinsic thereto.; thus ensuring humane treatment practices adhere strictly adhered principles emphasizing welfare preservation.&nbsp;&emsp;(See sections titled 'Ethical Considerations'.)&nbps;-
