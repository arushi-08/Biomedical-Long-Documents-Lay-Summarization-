 Summary:  The manuscript describes novel insights about T.tularesis pathophysiology, focusing primarily upon understanding why certain mutations affecting Gamma Glutamase Transpetiase affect organismal fitness


**Key Findings:**   



* **GGT plays key roles.** An intact "gamma glutamatelylc" operron comprising ftsKRTGHJIH coding beta lactamase I & II enzymes alongwith flhDCBA编码的Gamma GTpase(GGT) play crucial parts againsttularemus tularaemensis pathogenic success via regulating microbial redox status throughout immune evasion strategies employed toward hosts.<br> <BR><p/>     




This text summarizes clearly yet conciseleythe presented experimental procedures involving _Salmonella typhimurium_-related topics discussed later therefore ensuring accurate comprehension despite being brief
