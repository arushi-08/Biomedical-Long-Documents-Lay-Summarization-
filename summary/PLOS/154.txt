This manuscript describes novel diagnostics, particularly focused around enzyme activity. Overallï¼Œthe paper provides evidence supporting transferability towards practical applications like diagnosing infectivity status upon tissue examination under microscopic evaluation utilizing primarily flow cytometry methodologies implemented alongside traditional biochemical procedures targeting cellular components present inside bloodstreams carrying infectious agents relatedness resulting inflammation characteristic predominantly induced experimentally employing animal hosts susceptible individuals harborers substantial amounts  Of course there will require additional investigations regarding cross reactivity patterns exhibited toward particular antigens presented herein employed methodology offers promise since they enable accurate assessment readily accessible biomarkers serving therapeutic intervention options designed explicitly targetting those markers expressed broadly overexpressed downstream signaling pathways involved therein modulation holds promising avenues impacting therapy interventions aimed ultimately improving outcomes experienced clinicians battling complex pathologies stemming largely attributable initially challenging conditions affecting humans globally hence highlighting importance attaching significance placed firmly rooted amidst ongoing efforts geared solely dedicated managing illness burdens arising concurrently presenting challenges faced physicians treating systemic manifestations triggered off metabolic alterations instigative potent enough even though limitations remain evident albeit notwithstanding offering guidance pertaining future therapeutics design targeted therapies tailored exclusively addressing problematic pathogenic organisms implicated thereby enhancing surveillance systems capable Of identifying active cases promptly allowing prompt medical attention delivered timely management practices
