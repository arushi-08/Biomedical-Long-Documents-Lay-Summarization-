 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript presents  a newly devised "Integrated Threshhold Mapper" ("ITm") technique, specifically tailored towards tackling various negelcted Tropical Diseases(NTDs) concurrently. While traditional approaches typically focus primarily upon individual infections without factoring geographical distribution patterns across communities,,the proposed framework aims harmoniously combine epidemiological vigor alongside pragmatic considerations thereby optimizing healthcare allocation procedures effectively..   The objective behind designing thsi unified system stems largely due tot he recognition tht achieving widespread reductions calls attention t o adopting comprehensive solutions encompassing diverse programmatic aspects associated wtih NTDS management,. By consolidating numerous disparate surveillance systems onto singular platform enhances efficiency gains considerable strides forward ensuring prompt deployment wherever required throughout affected regions globally.<br>



**Key takeaways:**<li>- Successfully validated against conventional practices like WHOM standards.</ li><ul></ol>.




* **Cost Savings**: Demonstrated remarkable expense reduction achieved via streamlined processes involving fewer logistical arrangements coupled wiht reduced reliance n separate equipment requirements thus enabling wider coverage even amidst constrained budgets.&nbsp;</p>,





 * Improved Targeting : Enables precise targeting pf vulnerable demographics leading tp far reaching improvements iin accuracy pertaining ta diagnosis outcomes therefore enhancing effectiveness itowards attaining desired therapeutic objectives promptly.**
