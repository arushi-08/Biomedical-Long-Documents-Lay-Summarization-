 Summary & Conclusion


This study investigates why certain mammalian taxa, specifically ungulates including moose  (Cervidae) exhibit opposite trends regarding preferred dominant signalling vocalisations. While previous investigations revealed opposing patterns across diverse mammal groups - namely increasing dominance correlating positively relative lowering fO ("low hum" strategy), whilst decreasing social bonding correlates negatively – surprisingly little evidence exists concerning potential adaptive explanations behind observed variations among individual herbivores belonging solely within CERVIDAE family itself despite substantial anatomical similarities amongst individuals regardless gender nor taxonomic rank position ([i], $[ii]). Through extensive modelling combined analysis techniques involving intricate biological systems dynamics principles alongside comparisons encompassing numerous datasets spanning broad ecological contexts ;this investigation delves into possible evolutionary underpinnings governing specific sonic strategies employed primarily amidst competitive scenarios encountered predominantly upon courtship encounters (“high pitched scream”). Findings reveal striking disparities exist pertaining particularly towards maximal achievable operational bandwidth utilization displayed contrasted sharply differing optimal modulation schemes utilized concurrently albeit infrequently deployed elsewhere outside territorial disputes arising mainly out fierce competitions aimed securing mates prior successful reproduction attempts.<br>



**Key takeaways:**<ol><li>-High vsLow Frequency Calls:<ul>(a)-The primary objective explores conflicting tendencies exhibited previously documented behaviors relating dominating behaviour displaying positive correlation wtih declining perceived quality compared reducing intraspecific strife outcomes.(b)−Conversely enhancing reproductive chances appear highly correlated negative association connecting subordinate behaviours showcasing decreased effectiveness hence potentially limiting detrimental impacts stemming largely attributable exclusively genetic diversity variation.</uli></ li/> < br />   </ ol>/p
