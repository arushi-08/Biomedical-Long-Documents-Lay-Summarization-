 Summary:


This paper investigates  the impacts stopping Center For Diseases Controls And prevention(CDC) funded survellance programs might potentially lead. It uses data derived form successful containment efforts during previous dengue fevers, alongside estimates generated via modeling approaches across various delay situations - ranging anywhere betwen zero & eightweeks -, highlighting significant escalation resulting solely upon inadequate monitoring capabilities leading directly proportional increases towards overall healthcare expenditures incurred while battling said illnesses..



**Main Findings:**




* Stopping Mosquito Survelliance Can Increase Management Cost Of Epidemics Up To An Order Magnitude Higher Than Sustained Monitoring With Early Case Detection Strategies : Delaying controls raises substantial additional expenses which dwarf those stemming primarily out immediate treatment measures related either clinical care provision nor laboratory diagnostics procedures employed concurrently along side regular diagnostic tools utilized routinely prior illness manifestation ; therefore emphasizing their effectiveness over alternative strategies designed explicitly around prompt identification followed closely thereafter implementation tailored solutions aimed toward mitigating spread rates pertaining exclusively medical emergencies arising uniquely attributable entirely circumstance circumstances surrounding newly emerged contagious agents like influenza pandemics involving vectors capable transmitting deadly microbes worldwide,.   





The aforementioned outcomes underscore underscores urgency regarding allocation priorities relative future budgets allocated annually dedicated safeguarding communities vulnerable susceptible contracting debilitating ailments transmitted predominantly thru insects bearing potent microorganisms onto individuals residing therein.; consequently advocating strongly AGAINST any proposals proposing reductions impacting operational capacities geared expressly intended preventing widespread dissemination patterns inherent most commonly encountered among insect born maladies affecting populations globally,,,,,
