This comprehensive Systematic Review summarizes key insights gained, while highlighting challenges encountered. Here summarize below highlights extracted specifically pertaining "Susceptibility Factors" section.:



**Key takeaways:**   




* **Male Sex**: Males exhibit increased infectibility relative females mainly owing differing testing methodologies rather actual biological vulnerability towards Infection.. Children tend toward milder outcomes yet display elevated chances becoming clinically sick once afflicted,. Presence Of pets like chicken does appear beneficial reducing severity amongst males indicating indirect protection mechanisms via diversionary tactics implemented inadvertently alongside negative impacts witnessed previously documented elsewhere involving poultry farming practice.,. Dog Ownership serves pivotal roles influencing Transmission Dynamics hence warranting prioritization efforts focused combating Canine Reservoir Prevalence.<br>    <p/>     	





The report underscores substantial disparities stemming largely attributable either insufficient participant sampling leading unreliable estimates resulting ultimately impacting interpretations drawn subsequently.., Secondly concerns arise vis Ã  vie` problematic analytical approaches utilized particularly employing crude metrics instead sophisticated modeling tools designed explicitly tailored addressing complex relationships intrinsic characteristic datasets encompassing diverse disciplines therefore necessitating meticulous scrutiny moving forward.**
