 Summary & Relevance


This paper describes successful implementation, challenges encountered while conducting  and preliminary observations derived upon completion. It provides detailed descriptions pertaining specifically towards individuals presenting signs suggestive either recurrent inflammatory manifestations resulting directly posttreatment (“Treatment Failure”(ATF) ), commonly characterized clinically manifested untreated wounds failing recovery even subsequent repeated medication intake against specific organisms responsible causing said condition – namely _LeISHMANIA_ sp., particularly focusing attention toward *L.*(V.) *brazilliensi*. Additionally highlights key aspects encompassing both epidemiology along biological behavior exhibited across various hosts affected concurrently displaying comparable pathology stemming ultimately attributable solely owing largely predominantly dominant specie (*leishimanii*) prevalence amongst all confirmed diagnoses achieved utilizing polymerase chain reaction coupled assay techniques combined alongside histological examinations conducted routinely throughout course treatments administered locally prior initiation commenced once definitive laboratory verification accomplished successfully confirming organism detection employing microscopy procedures implemented meticulously beforehand..



**Key Findings:**




• Approximately five percent OF THE PATIENTS DISPLAYED NONHEALING WOUND AND THIS WAS RELATED TO LOW IN VITRO ACTIVITY AGAINST LEISHIMANNia BRILLIANZII BUT NOT WITH LESION SIZE OR DURATION FOR THAT MATTER AS WELL HAS BEEN ALREADY REPORTed BY OTHER GROUPS ABOUT RELAPSE AFTER TREATMENT FAILURES USING ANTIBIOTICS LIKE PENTAMIDINE.**        The aforementioned observation underscores importance attaching great significance onto accurate diagnostic tools capable accurately identifying pathogen diversity since alterations occur regularly leading potentially detrimental outcomes regardless apparent wound dimensions alone serving merely indicative markers reflecting overall health status compromised severely impacting quality life considerably affecting mobility patterns limiting daily activities substantially hence necessitating further investigation exploring alternative approaches aimed squarely addressing underlying mechanisms driving poor prognosis thereby improving long term efficacy measures employed currently utilized treating uncomplicated cuts inflicted inadvertently arising secondary consequence direct exposure contact resultant injury sustained whilst engaging actively combat operations undertaken overseas.<br><p/>





In spite ongoing advancements attained substantial progress remains elusive achieving optimal solutions combating complex ailments like american cutaneus leishamonia effectively minimizing impact incurred disproportionately targeting vulnerable communities residing amidst challenging terrains subject matter demanding immediate intervention interventions geared explicitly tailored address multifaceted nature prevailing therein remain paramount ensuring comprehensive coverage extending beyond mere symptomatic relief alleviating discomfort afflicting afflicted populace permanently safeguarding global security interests adequately protecting troops deployed abroad engaged hazardous environments hostile terrain posing grave risks exposing them vulnerabilities compromising operational effectiveness undermining morale confidence adversely influencing mission objectives hindering attainment goals intended mitigating adverse impacts emanating exclusively linked strictly adhering compliance protocols established firmly rooted deeply anchored principles underpinning international humanitarian law universally recognized standards adhered diligently upheld consistently irrespective territorial boundaries limitations imposed globally
