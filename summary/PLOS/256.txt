 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes investigations involving  the epidemiology, pathology. And genetics concerning Chygash'adisease(CD) amongst Brazilians residing outside metropolitan centers employing multiplex Real Time PolymerASE Chain Reaction quantifyingparasite Load combined alongside traditional Typing Upfront With Multi locus ConventionalPCR techniques applied upon Blood Clinical Isolates derived straightlyFrom Chronic Carriers diagnosed Through Indirect Immunofluorescent Techniques.. Key Findings include :



* High Prevalence - Approximately halfOfThe participants displayed Positive Amplification viaRealTimeqPCR Targeting Nuclear Satellite DNAshowing substantial heterogeneity regardingParas item density Among Different Age GroupsAnd Gender Categories ; however，no Significant Differences Were Found Between Males AND Females Or Older Versus Younger Individuals Within Their Respective Infection Levels Based Upon Sex Hormones ORAge Group Category。   It Was Observed That Higher Heart Failure Related Cases Occurred More FrequentlyAmong Women Than Men Across Both Youngestand Adult Ages Which Could Be AttributedTo Hormonal Factors Leading TO Increased Susceptibility OF THE Female PopulationTO Cardiovascular Complications AssociatedWith Parasitic InfectionsIn Addition tp Other Risk Factor Such AS Advanced Stage Cardiomyopathies Not Included Under Our Study Design 。    These Observations Are Consistent WITH Prior Studies Reporting Similar Outcomes FOR THIS Region BUT NOT necessarily Representative EnoughFor Drawing Conclusive inferences About Overall Epidemiology Given Limited Sample Size PerGroup Compared Against Large Scale Community Surveys Currently Available Throughout Literature Data.;




• Distribution Patterns − While There Is An Established RelationshipBetween Geographic Origination Area AND DTO U Type Distributed Accordingto Previous Reports Where TnCrUIIs Prevalent mainly Over SoutheasternBrazil,,Our Investigation revealed additional foci Including NortheasternStates LikeRioGrandeDo NordesteOrBahiaStateWhere MixedInfectioNwasObservedMore OftenThanExpectedBasedOnPriorReports.(See Tables Three&Four).





OverallResults suggestThat Further Research Should Focus primarilyUpon Understanding Better How Genetic Diversity ImpactsClinical ManifestationsEspeciallyRegarding Its Potential UsefulnessFORPrognosis purposesSinceThereAre Still Many Unanswered Questions Surrounding Complex Interactions BETWEEN Host Genetics Togetherwith Pathogen BiologyEven Though Some Advances Have Been Made Towards Diagnostic Tools Specifically DesignedAgainst Specific Subtypes
