 Summary & Relevance


This manuscript explores limitations imposed upon ionotropic receptor functionality via electrical coupling. Specifically, focusing  on Voltage gated Na+ Channels - key players enabling rapid signal transmission across neurons – and analyzes factors shaping diverse behaviors observed among individual variants encoded throughout mammal genomes (~nine). It investigates theoretically derived bounds based off elementary biophysical principles governing excitation thresholds ("excitabilities") required during initiation processes like propagating signals known commonly referred "action Potential."
