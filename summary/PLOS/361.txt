**Main Findings:**




* **High Prevalence**: Approximately half pfall chaga diseased HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS exhibitedorgan affection indicating high burdenonhealthservices particularly femalesat reproductive ages residing primarily outside major cities who often require emergency interventions like cesarean sections during childbirth leadingto substantial costs exceeding € three thousand per case,.





 * Male gender ; older adults (>age group); primary diagnose,; previous readmission;, elevated expense beyond€﻿ three thousandswere statistically correlated positively whereas younger adult groups,( specifically teens&youngadults), shorter stays,&emergency versus planned admittions displayed inverse associations wtih organs affected afflictions.**







In spite its strengths providing comprehensive inpatient datasets covering nearly twenty year span., certain inherent constraints limit interpretations:. Firstly lack precise geographic details pertaining tountry origins restricts calculations based upon regional variations hence limiting insightsinto potential disparities amongst diverse populations arriving viamigration patterns.; Secondly although offering detailed demographic profiles alongside diagnostic codes offers valuable insight yet inadequate evidence concerning underlying risks factor assessment.& Finally challenges arisewhen attempting comparisons against generalizable estimates owing tothe limited availability complete epidemiologicaldata encompassing entire nation' s populace.,.Therefore implementing standardized strategies addressing issues surrounding prenatal testing combinedw ith enhanced awareness campaigns tailored toward vulnerable demographics will prove instrumental i improving outcomes whilst minimizing adverse effects stemming fron undiagnoseded condition
