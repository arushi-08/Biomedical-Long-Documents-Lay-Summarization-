This paper describes, among its primary objective - investigating links  between zIKA Virus Infection And Congenital Malformations With Archived Samples From Mothers Who Gave Births At Two Hospitals On Oahu Between Years. Although limited primarily focused upon establishing such connection it does offer valuable insights into epidemiology trends across different geographic locations globally while highlighting existing challenges faced clinicians dealing diagnoses involving newly emerged pathogens likezKIVa.. Here' s summarized key takeaways :



**Key Findings:**   




* **Presence OF THE FIRST CONGENITAL CASE AND ASSOCIATION WITH MICROCEPHALY IN HAWAII**: First documented instance pf congeital infections stemming form HIVA observed stateside alongside confirmation via HighiggM titres present int he bloodstream despite lacking confirmatory techniques commonly utilized today(e., PRNT).     





 * Six newborns affected exhibited signs suggestive o fmicrocepahly ; however limitations pertaining inadequate diagnostic tools restrict conclusive validation hence necessitating larger future investigations focusing specifically around prenatal diagnosis strategies designed explicitly targeting newborn screening procedures.<br>
