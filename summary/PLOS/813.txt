**Main Findings:**    The deployment Of IIN provided substantial relief From bovine babesiosis infection rates amongst farmhouses under investigation - achieved through complete elimination OF tetse infestation around them ; furthermore there exists evidence suggesting possible indirect advantages stemming FROM ITS utilization beyond direct impact On target organisms like bovines e..g., enhanced hygiene practices adopted concurrently WITH THE USE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS RELATED TO THIS STUDY WILL NEED FURTHER RESEARCH FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING BUT IMMEDIATE ACTION IS REQUIRED To address challenges faced BY FARMERS IN PURCHASING OR USING ANY AVAILABLE CONTROL AGENTS AGAINST TRYPANOSOMIASIS.**
