The present work describes novel therapeutic interventions targeting cancer therapy. Although our current approaches primarily focus, highlighting molecular alterations made throughout various cancers such intervention methods hold promise because overexpression enhances understanding cellular processes involved mainly intracellular redistribution across numerous tumors where activation leads commonly observed changes frequently employed therapeutics agents often utilized clinically validated drug discovery alongside clinical efficacy testing procedures
