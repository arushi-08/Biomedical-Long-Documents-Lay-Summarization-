 Summary  of Findings :


This paper describes, identifies genetic variability amongst organisms responsible.forchromblastromycesinnamental illness across various locations insideBrazil'S endemiscareasand proposes classification adjustments primarily centeredaroundtwonovelfungus kinds—Rhinacladia tropcalisisadCypollophera ludoviciens--withinHer potricthrillaceae,. These discoveries contribute significantly towards understanding variationsamongstpathogenic microorganisms capable causingChrom blastromcytosis(CT)worldwide..
