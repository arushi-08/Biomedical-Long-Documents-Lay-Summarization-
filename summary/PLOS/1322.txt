 Summary


This report describes eleven consecutive, untreated  cases presenting primarily within five decades. These include eight adults displaying various presentations ranging across different organ systems - predominantly affecting either their hearts directly ("isolated" versus "disseminated") alongside simultaneous spread throughout major blood vessel networks (“systemic”). Additionally includes details about potential risks linked specifically towards each condition separately alongwith overall survival prospects post diagnoses despite limitations inherent upon managing ceftrionic infections arising concurrently elsewhere outside native tissues comprising vital structures essential toward daily functions – namely kidneys，liver、lungs 、heart valves。The paper emphasizes challenges faced whilst attempting standardization approaches given variations encountered among infected populations worldwide highlighting ongoing need pertaining particularly concerning drug dosage schedules designed against parasitical organisms known collectively encompassing taenia species
