 Summary:  The impact Of Japanese encephalititis Virus(Jev) Infectibility Between Gi And Gui Strains On CX. Pipens Mosquitos From china


This paper explores, via experimental evidence gathered utilizing cx pinnes mosquitos' involvement   as models organism,,whether there exists any disparity regarding Jev viridity amongst gi & giii stains against said insects.. Here summarizes key points :



**Key Findings:**




* **Similarinfectiveness**: Experimental outcomes revealed comparable levels o finfection Rate Growth Kinetics -Disseminations Rates AND TransmissionsRates BETWEEN THE TWO STRAINS OF JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS IN MOSQUITOES FROM CHINA indicating simlar replicative capacity despite slight decline upon prolonged cultivation.(Table Two).





â€¢	Both genotyes exhibited identical patterns concerning spreading disease agents TO Secondary Organs With approximately equal prevalence,(table One), although only low numbers displayed positivity FOR SALIVA LOAD AT ANY GIVEN TIME POINT.<BR>.







***Potential Role Within Shift Dynamics ***






Although preliminary investigations indicate possible contribution pf mosquittos tp jEv GENOTYPE SHIFT dynamics,,,the present finding suggests otherwise,. Further extensive experimentation involving diverse Representative StrainS Is Required Before drawing definitive conclusions.**
