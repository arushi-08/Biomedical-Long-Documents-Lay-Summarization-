 Summary  of Findings :


This paper describes, firstly，a new methodology based upon MRI technology combined traditional histology. Secondly ，the pathology features exhibited throughout murine pneumonitis secondary infections produced via intratracheae instillateion employing _Paracoccus brsiiliendise_ spores ; Thirdly 、its potential utility against therapy assessment purposes utilizing said methodologies under diverse circumstances..   The primary objective achieved here involves establishing standardized quantitative measurements encompassing volumetric alterations alongside qualitative assessments conducted routinely across pathohistology departments worldwide—all accomplished utilising readily available equipment commonly utilized clinically rather novel instrumentation dedicated solely towards rodent experimentation needs alone.<br><BR>.



**Main Points:**




* Conventional magnetic resonance computerised imagery(MRCI) offers advantages including visualization capabilities comparable if necessary directly onto living tissues enabling longitudinal tracking overtime along side minimizing invasiveness thereby decreasing numbers needed sacrificed overall thus enhancing reproducibility since identical samples remain intact allowing detailed examination later should complications arise.; 





 * Serial examinations enable clinicians ascertain whether treatments interventions prove effective reducing reliance sampling burdening subjects unnecessarily therefore improving quality assurance standards whilst ensuring safety conditions aren't compromised.**
