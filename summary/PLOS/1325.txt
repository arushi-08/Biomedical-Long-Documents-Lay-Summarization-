 Summary:  Asymptoatic Carriage, Transmission Routes & Potential Control Strategies - Hemophilius Duceryei And Trueperella Pallidam Subspecies Pertenues


This paper investigates instances when haemophilicducrie(H.Du)andTruepperalla pallida ssp.(T).p.)perttenuecontainment exists amongst asymptomaticskin inhabitants residing amidst YAWS eradicated regions employing Azitromicin Mass Drug Administration,(MDA), highlighting novel reservoirs capableof perpetuating infected states despite successful reduction via MDMAgainst sores resulting primarilyfromYAWs etiology..
