 Summary & Conclusion


This paper presents detailed analyses estimating, via multiplier Factors(MF),  the extent   of UnderRecognition Of Laboratory Confirmed Cases With Symptoms suggestive OF Acute Infection BY DENVER Virus Among Child Patients Aged Less Than Fifteen Years Old. Two longitudinalcohort Studies Were Conducted Across Three Sites Within Their Respective Countries -Thailand AND CAMBODIA-, Between YearS That Provided Data Used As Basis FOR THE CALCULATIONS Presented HereIN THIS STUDY THAT AIMED TO ASSESS UNDERRECOGNITION IN NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS AS WELL HAS PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT AGE DISTRIBUTION WITH RESPECTTO SYMPtomatOLOGY OR HOSPITALIZATION STATUS RELATED THERETO EACH CASE GROUPING CRITERIA USED LOCALLY BUT NOT NATIONWIDE..



**Key Findings:**




* Annual Incidence Rates : Estimated yearly occurrence rates across surveyed communities exceeded twenty illnesses Per Thousand Individuals.<br> <li>-In THAILAND it averaged nearly Twenty Five Illness Events OutOf Every Thousands People Below Sixteen Each YEAR.(The Range Was Around Thirty Seven Through Eleven). </LI><BR>.	    		       ﻿





 *A Median Estimate Is Given At Lower End Which Represents Minimum Number Occurring Throughout Country Wide.**

• Estimates Suggest High Burden Even Though Reporting Systems Are Efficient Enough Not Only Regarding Severe Disease Case RecognitionBut Also About Overall Prevalence Including Mild Fever Without Serious Manifestations Such Like Hemorrhage Or Liver Dysfunction.--
