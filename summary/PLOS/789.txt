 Summary & Conclusion  


This study describes new insights regarding SAP,a major facilitator employed throughout microbial adaptation. Briefly summarized below :   



**SAP plays pivotal roles:**    * Resistance towards antibacterial agents involving inhibitionof Amphostlin deposition onto cellular targets ; targeting hydrophobic regions common among various pathogens; modulation leading enhanced organism fitness versus hosts defenses especially amid high salinity stress situations where osmotic balance becomes compromised hence essential foe homeostasis maintenance between organisms residing inside humans nasal cavities along side inflammatory responses induced post viral assault.; And finally promoting inflammation suppression potentially impacting epithelial barrier integrity enabling invasion once internalizing certain microbes despite elevated salt gradients created specifically designed toward minimizing damage caused mainly because excessive salts restrict diffusion rates.(Abstract)
