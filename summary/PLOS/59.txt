 Summary  of Findings :


This manuscript presents novel insights gained via Electron Cryo tomography(crypTO) imaging, revealing new details regarding Herpetic Simplex Virus Type I's（HSV‑I）genome package. Key takeaways include：



**The discovery:**   Of particular interest lies "portal Vertex Associated Tegment" or ``PVat,'' discovered amidst intricate arrangements observed upon examination utilizing cryPTOR technology alongside advanced algorithms like Multivariate Statistical Analyses-(MSA)- guided classifications along side Melon Ball Alignments methodologies..




* **Unique Feature**: Uniquely positioned relative either pentagonal apex ("pental")Vertex OR far away From Center OF THE CapsID Shell—the Pvat stands apart amongst various architectural elements characterizing herPsvIs’ encapsidation mechanisms offering valuable clues towards future investigations involving drug design targeting specific sites related specifically With Genome Release AND Nuclear Entry processes occurring post infection.<br>
