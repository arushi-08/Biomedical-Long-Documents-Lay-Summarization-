 Summary & Conclusion


This paper describes,  the epidemiology relatedness among residents near mountains. Additionally identifies novel molecular markers potentially useful clinically distinguishing various subtypes while characterizing environmental risks influencing transmission patterns across diverse ecosystems worldwide particularly focusing uponSeoul Metropolitan City where urbanization expands rapidly leading changes over landscape dynamics impacting wildlife populations hence increasing likelihood encounters humans versus pathogens like bacteria causing scrubs Typhusstsutsugahiinfection(OT). Overall finding suggest prompt medical intervention should consider early detection strategies targeting susceptible demographics residing close proximity environmentally hazardous zones coupled together comprehensive surveillance systems designed specifically tailored towards mitigating outbreaks effectively preventing future epidemics spreading beyond borders thereby safeguarding vulnerable communities globally
