This text describes finding, characterizing novel coronavirus infectious agent. This manuscript presents evidence demonstrating their inherent antivirus properties exerted upon SARS‐CoV‑Infections involving molecular interactions among various organisms particularly highlighting  the effectiveness exhibited across diverse species belonging specifically towards COVID−SARS—a highly pathogenic betacoronavirus infections caused primarily clinical isolates derived form Southeast Asia where they cause substantial morbidity resulting ultimately leading upregulations limiting excessive inflammation throughout body tissue damage sustained mostly intracellularly produced cytokine storminess triggered apoptosis pathways initiated prior exposure therefore providing proof regarding therapeutic intervention possibilities relatedness toward controlling pathological processes underlying severe illness linked thereto
