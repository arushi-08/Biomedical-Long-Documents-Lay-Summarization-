 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes  the identification, characterisationÔºåand functional validation¬†(Figure I)‚Ä®that reveals involvement Of miRs. And specifically focusing On MIR‚Äërelated alterations impacting CTip dynamics regulating HRr activation initiated By ionising radiations exposure.(Abstract).

 Overall Significance:-    These finding contribute towards understanding How genetic instability contributes toward resistance AGAINST therapeutic interventions aimed At harnessING HDRAs FOR treating tumors since dysregulations governing key molecules Like CTRIs appear pivotal NOT ONLY AFTER BUT ALSO BEFORE actual lesion Formation
