 Summary & Conclusion


This paper investigates, retroactively over six  years. From Janurary 'o eight till Junuary ‘til year end ’thirteen hundred twenty‐eight consecutive admitted instances involving bacteria grown out if human tissue specimens presented themselves during regular daily operations across diverse departments throughout Hospitals treating Infectious Disease located southwards Hanoi city limits –Hospitalized Telfort D(HT)––withSalmonella NonTyphimialia Serotype Infection Syndrome,(IITS). With its comprehensive approach encompassing detailed clinicopathological investigations alongside genetic profiling techniques via multiplex locus seqeuncing methodology combined wtih antibiotic sensitivity assays,,this investigation offers valuable insights pertaining t othe Epidemiology And Pathogenicity OF ITS IN THE VIETNAMESSE CONTEXT AND PROVIDES EVIDENCE FOR INCREASED SURVIVABILITY WITH EARLY ANTIBIOTIC USE BUT ALSO HIGH RESISTANCE AGAINST SOME COMMON AGENTS LIKE CEFTRIAXONE OR CIPROFLOXCIN THAT CALLFOR CONTINUOUS RESEARCH INTO THIS SERIOUS HEALTH CONCERN AS WELL ASSURE FUTURE PREVENTION STRATEGIES ARE PUTTING Into Place.<br>



**Key Findings:**




* **High Mortality Rate**: Approximately nearly ¼ thridrd pf paitents succumbed owing ito complications arising directly attributable tot he underlying health conditions rather THAN DIRECTLY RELATED TO THEIR CONDITIONS AFTER HOSPITALIZATION.(The latter includes deaths occurring shortly efter leaving healthcare facilities.)   It underscores why prompt detection coupled wiht effective treatments remain pivotal towards mitigating potential outcomes among vulnerable communities affected b y ntTS afflictions worldwide..     





 * ***HIV Infectioan Is Major Risk Factor ****For Death Among Adults While Similar Age Groups Are At Higher Risks During Childhood Illness Due Primarily tp Malnutrition Or Malaria Related Issues Not Directly Associated Wih AIDS Virus Prevalence Which Predominantly Impacts Adult Males Aged Around Their Late Twenties Upto Early Thirties.**
