 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes studies investigating  the potential therapeutic target, plasmatocytoid dendritic Cells(pDCS) involvement against newly diagnosed severe COVID‐associated pneumonia. Here researchers utilized murine Models Of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus Infection And Immunopathology Through High Dose Antibiotic Treatment Over Time course over several months along side controls receiving placebo therapy.. Their key finding includes :



**Inhibition pf Pdc Depletion Rescues Immune System From Rapid Decline:** Researchers discovered upon analyzing serum cytokine profiles throughout illness severity stages across diverse patient cohorts revealed consistently lower concentrations particularly IFNa among critically ill participants who succumbed prematurely regardless whether given antibiotics targeting bacterial growth alone without addressing underlying inflammation issues caused primarily because excessive cellular apoptosis triggered directly proportional reduction amongst circulating lymphocytes especially involving natural Killer DC subsets characterized predominantly By PDAs binding receptors present mainly onto immature DCs rather Than matured ones residing deep inside secondary lymphatic follicles where most active host defense takes place thereby limiting overall effectiveness towards combating infectious agents effectively even though there might exist some residual protection afforded solely based off remaining low grade innate responses delivered locally around sites affected initially once pathological changes begin spreading beyond initial reservoirs leading ultimately toward poor clinical outcome irrespective any antibiotic intervention implemented concurrently alongside conventional medical interventions designed strictly targeted exclusively aimed reducing bacteria burdening susceptible populations prone developing SARS CoV related complications resulting often fatal consequences shortly thereafter unless immediate action taken promptly intervene timely measures capable mitigating detrimental effects stemming largely attributed precisely inadequate suppression achieved utilizing existing antimicrobial therapies commonly employed routinely deployed clinically therefore highlighting need explore alternative approaches tailored explicitly address ongoing challenges encountered currently confronting clinicians battling aggressive forms Covid – Associated Pneumonia
