 Summary  of Findings :


This paper describes results related specifically towards assessing wash practices' impacts upon various worm burdens. It primarily focuses around its association, alongside medication usage ("albendazaole"Â and "prazioquel") aimed toward managing such worms based off fecal contamination risks observed throughout wastewater systems globally known commonly referred too under 'Helminthes'. Here summarizes key takeaways below ;



**Key Takeaways:**   




* Albendraze effectively lowers chances experiencing general Stenthematodes(STHs) regardless whether paired together along side lavatory accessibility options like flushing toilets versus utilizing alternative solutions involving rainwater harvesting tanks designed explicitly targeting clean cooking waters supplies although offering little extra benefits beyond basic treatments already implemented elsewhere..





 * Safe floorings proved beneficial mainly impacting individual residing outside urban settlements where plumbing infrastructure isn`t readily obtainable yet can substantially decrease sturmatode infestation likelihood even absent medications,.






The overall finding suggests implementing robust health policies focused predominantly centered solely round improving sanitary amenities rather incorporating complex multifaceted management plans encompassing diverse sectors might prove cost ineffective unless accompanied concurrently addressing existing issues pertaining directly linked poor environmental circumstances prevailing locally
