 Summary & Conclusion


This paper investigates  the molecular epidemiology, genetics variation across Space And Time Of _L. Major_ From Three Governorats With Different Levels OF Endemism By Using Microsattelite Markers Through Multilocus Typing Techniques Across Multiple Geographic Locations Within Tunisia Where Zoonose Cutaneous Leprosy Is Endemic.. Here summarizes key points :



**Key Findings:**




* **High Allele Richnesses**: High allele richnesss characterized throughout studied isolations highlighting successful adaptation against changing environments along its host ranges ; however heterozgyosit deficits exist possibly reflecting complex reproductive biology involving cloning mechanisms alongside sexual recombination leading potentially biased estimations towards extreme rarity under such circumstances.<br>   <p/>    Â  <li>- Low levels if heterozygous disparity amongst examined populaions irrespective pf location status confirm widespread mixing via movement pathways.</ li>< br>. </ul></ol)





The present investigation sheds light onto potential interventions targeting newly infected zones considering heterogeneous distributions resulting form ongoing dispersal processes driven primarily though trade networks established locally near settlements versus natural boundaries imposed upon wild landscapes surrounding villages
