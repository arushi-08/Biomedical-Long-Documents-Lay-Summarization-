 Summary & Conclusion


This manuscript describes comprehensive metabonomic profiling conducted within _E.histolytic_ extracellular fluid, revealing alterations triggered specifically  upon acute inflammatory stimuli imposed chemically utilizing Hydrogenperoxides(Hydrogen peroxidase) -induced redox imbalance model organism,. Through untargeted lipidomics approach combined advanced MS techniques researchers successfully deciphered complex interplay among diverse signaling networks underlying inflammation related perturbations occurring throughout host immune reactions involving bacterial infections.. Their finding contribute novel insights regarding modulations exhibited primarily targeting carbohydrate-, fattyacid -,and purinome profiles along side intricate regulation governing energetic homeostasis achieved predominantly though diversionary fluxes toward anaerobic respiration products â€“ particularly glycerin utilization alongside diminished reliance heavily compromised glyconeogenesis capacity characteristically displayed amidst pathological states characterized elevated systemic Inflammation
