 Summary & Conclusion


This paper analyzes historic distributions, shifts  in geographical centers,,and clustered occurrences associatedwith Human CutaneousAnthax(HCA) within Azerbaijani territory. It covers various aspects including :



**Changes Patterns:**   The investigation reveals significant reductions alongside distinct regional disparities when analyzing HCa prevalence via different intervals spanning nearly four decades.. An upward tendency till late 'the middle-'of their respective eras characterized initial widespread growth prior tothe commencement ovaccination programs initiated concurrently along side declines thereafter,. Additionally noteworthy highlights exist regarding movements toward Eastward migration centered mainly nearBaku city once being predominantly distributed Westwards earlier,,,These dynamics underscore underscores significance placedon implementing tailored intervention tactics grounded firmly rooted onto epidemiological insights gained thus far.<br>




 **Spatial Distribution**: Spatial dispersion plays pivotal role shaping outcomes pertainingto HCAs etiology ; consequently mapping serves crucial roles aiding policymakers develop strategic plans effectively combatting infections spreading beyond borders.**







Overall Findings suggest adopting "oneHealth" strategy encompassing preventive actions against Livestock,;this methodology holds promise improving overall effectiveness combating ZoONotic Diseases.(ZDs).
