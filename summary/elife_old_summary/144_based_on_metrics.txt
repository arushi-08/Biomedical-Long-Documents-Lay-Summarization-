 Summary of the text:

This text describes the functional switching valve within the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla. This valve complex is used to control the direction of seminal flow and allows females to obtain additional nutrition from a male.

**Key points:**

* The switching valve is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and two canals.
* Females have a penis-like intromittent organ to coercisively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen.
* The semen is packed in a capsule and is used for fertilization and nutrition.
* The switching valve has two slots for insemination, allowing females to receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males.
* The evolution of the switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla.
* The switching valve is a novel adaptation that has not been observed in other insects.
* The presence of the switching valve has significant implications for understanding the evolution of sex-role reversal and the adaptations that drive it.

**Overall, this text provides a detailed description of the functional switching valve in Neotrogla, highlighting its importance in the evolution of the species and its potential impact on sexual selection.**
