Sure, here is a summary of the text in a way that is easier to understand for a 5-year-old:

In the insect world, there's a fascinating species called Neotrogla that has a unique way of reproducing. Females of Neotrogla have a special organ called the spermathecal plate that helps them control the direction of their sperm.

The spermathecal plate is like a switching valve that allows females to choose which direction to send their sperm. It's like a tiny valve that can open and close to control the flow of water.

The females of Neotrogla have a long copulation time, which means they can spend a long time with the male. This is because they need to make sure they get all the nutrients they need from the male's sperm.

The spermathecal plate is a very important adaptation for Neotrogla because it allows them to compete for mates and get more nutrition. It's a unique feature that makes Neotrogla a fascinating insect to study.
