 Summary of Findings and Implications

This research describes the functional switching valve within the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla. The valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. Females have a penis-like intromittent organ to coercisively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule, whose formation is initiated by seminal injection. The valve complex has two slots for insemination, allowing Neotrogla to continue mating while the first slot is occupied.

**Key Findings:**

* The switching valve mechanism is located at the spermathecal plate.
* The valve allows females to control the direction of seminal flow.
* The presence of the spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow may further refine our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus.
* The switching valve system reported here likely represents an adaptation for direct benefits rather than for genetic benefits.

**Implications:**

* The evolution of the switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla.
* The switching valve allows females to obtain more nutrition from a male.
* The switching valve could be a valuable tool for understanding the evolution of female reproductive organs and the mechanisms underlying sex-role reversal.

**Overall, this research provides a detailed description of the functional switching valve within the female genitalia of Neotrogla, highlighting its significance in the evolution of the genus and its potential for further scientific investigation.**
