 Summary of the text:

This text describes the functional switching valve within the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla. This valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. Females have a penis-like intromittent organ to coercisively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule, whose formation is initiated by seminal injection. The valve complex has two slots for insemination, allowing Neotrogla to continue mating while the first slot is occupied.

**Key points:**

* The switching valve is a novel mechanism that allows females to control the direction of seminal flow.
* The valve complex has two slots for insemination, allowing females to receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males.
* The presence of the switching valve further refines our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus.
* The switching valve system likely represents an adaptation for direct benefits rather than for genetic benefits.

**Additional notes:**

* The text is well-written and concise, but could be improved by breaking up some of the longer sentences and rephrased to make the text more readable.
* The text includes a lot of technical details about the structure of the switching valve, which may be unnecessary for some readers.
* The text includes a lot of information about the biology of Neotrogla, which may also be unnecessary for some readers.
* The text includes a lot of information about the methods used to study the switching valve, which may also be unnecessary for some readers.
