 processive movement along an individual protofilament during cellular motility events such as mitosis or meiosis. The new model also provides insights about why some kinesins have evolved so many different mechanisms: they can be divided broadly according to whether their mechanism involves one head gating another through steric hindrance between them; if not then either way it relies upon allosteric communication within both subunits - even though there may well exist exceptions where only one subunit has been adapted specifically for its function. Our results suggest strategies towards engineering novel molecular machines using engineered proteins containing multiple copies of identical building blocks designed de novo rather than those derived naturally from nature. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Kinesin superfamily members 1 3 9 kDa homodimers move processively over long distances along cytoskeletal filaments called MTs To date all known crystal structure determinations of dimeric human KIF1A were made without MT present In contrast our previous work showed that when complexed together, tubulin dimers adopt curved conformations similar to what was observed previously For example, while most class II kinesins bind preferentially straight regions of αβ -tubulins Here we report high quality maps showing density corresponding precisely to residues 2 0 8 − 4 7 0aa of KIF1A.MTBDs attached directly onto α -1 β -2 heterodimers located near inter faces between adjacent longitudinal intra uft helices (Fig Fig2A2A & B). This allowed us to build complete atomistic models representing three distinct conformational stages associated with binding plus ends of single stranded A b -B tubules formed spontaneously under conditions used here but more generally across diverse systems including bacterial cell division machinery, eukaryotic flagella assembly, etc It should however be noted that although the overall architecture appears very consistent among various classes I + IV kinesins studied thus far, details vary significantly depending on experimental method employed e.g. Cryo electron microscopy allows direct visualization of protein complexes embedded inside vitrified ice However, despite recent advances in cryoET methods allowing sub nanometer detail imaging of biological samples, particularly macromolecular assemblies like ribosomes Recently developed computational tools allow reconstruction of 3D volumes down to ~ 4nm Resolution Using available crystallographic data for apo state KNSK4 Motor domains lacking N terminal helix H1 show large differences compared to full length molecules indicating important roles played by loop L1 2 and C terminus tail region in mediating interactions with MTs While several studies reported existence of additional secondary elements beyond α4, α5 and α6 seen earlier in MD simulations Another interesting feature revealed recently by combining NMR spectroscopy With respect to functional significance of particular features identified above, comparison of current study with prior works shows good agreement regarding key aspects related mainly to relative orientation of switch loops L2 and L5 and conformation of P loop.On the contrary, detailed description differs substantially concerning position of α3 and α2 helical segments and arrangement of L8 Helix α7 does appear somewhat variable probably due to lack of sufficient number of independent observations. Nevertheless, general trends seem clear enough to justify further investigation aiming at understanding precise role of specific amino acids involved in interaction network described below. Finally, given relatively low resolutions achieved experimentally, especially around flexible parts of molecule shown schematically in Figs Figs2 2- -4 4- -5 5- -6 6- -7 7- -8 3- -9 1- -9 8- < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ ▃ < CONCLUSION > < FREETEXT > Discussion and Conclusions ▃ Overall analysis presented herein suggests plausible explanation behind fundamental properties underlying mechanochemical coupling exhibited by homodimeric KIF1 family member KIF1A.The proposed framework explains numerous biochemical experiments performed before now providing valuable information needed for future design efforts aimed toward development of artificial nanomachines composed entirely out of natural components. Furthermore, since almost every step discussed throughout manuscript could potentially occur independently albeit less efficiently because of limited space availability, alternative schemes involving cooperative effects cannot yet be ruled out.This article reports first ever comprehensive picture describing major changes occurring locally surrounding catalytic site following initial contact formation followed by subsequent closure induced solely by mechanical strain exerted against substrate surface. Although considerable progress had already been accomplished in elucidating global rearrangements taking place globally leading up to final product complex Formation of stable intermediate species requires much longer time scale dynamics likely inaccessible currently owing to technical limitations inherent to cryogenic techniques. Thus, obtaining quantitative kinetic parameters characterizing transition rates governing association kinetics would require considerably higher concentrations of reactants being able to overcome diffusion limitation imposed by small size of system considered hereinafter. Despite difficulties encountered in modeling transient intermediates resulting mostly from insufficient sampling power provided by conventional simulation protocols, nevertheless qualitative conclusions drawn from static representations remain valid. Moreover, considering potential ambiguity introduced by force field approximations, careful validation will always need complementary approaches employing alternate methodologies capable of capturing dynamic behavior accurately. As mentioned elsewhere, use of enhanced sampling algorithms combined with improved energy functions might help achieve better convergence rate thereby improving accuracy of predictions Obtaining accurate estimates of free energies required for estimating reaction barriers remains challenging task requiring extensive computing resources. Nonetheless, significant improvement seems possible once reliable sets of reference values become publicly accessible. Future investigations focusing primarily on determining exact location of phosphate group released post catalysis coupled with determination of protonation status of titratable groups responsible for pH dependence of enzymatic activity shall shed light on crucial factors controlling directionality of motion displayed by KIF
