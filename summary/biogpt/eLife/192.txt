Adrenal Insufficiency Patients During Physiological Glucocorticoid Treatment Compared To Withdrawal Phase Transcriptomic Profile Derived From Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and Adipose Tissue Using Integrative Multiomics AnalysisPlasma MicroRNA Cluster Predicts Glucocorticoid Exposition Correlate WITH EXCELLENT LEVELS FROM SEROLOGIC TESTS AND METABOLISM PART I: Transcriptome Data Set Comparison Between Treatments Revealed Significant Differences Only When Comparing Normal vs. Low Dose Dexamethasone Administration (p ≤ 0. 0 5 after False Discovery Rate correction). There WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATMENTS USING MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS INCLUDING TWO GROUPS: low dose dexamethasone treatment group vs placebo control groups and high versus normal doses of glucocorticoids administration groups.Differentially expressed genes showed enrichment mainly related TO SIGNALING PROCESS GENES REGULAR OR GENE ENDOCRINE FUNCTION ASSOCIATED PROTEINS THAN HISTONEURIN TYPES. Among them we found several microRNAs which have already shown association withCushing's syndrome such asmir -1 5a *, mir-3 4a, miR1 8a, miR3 0a, let 7g andlet7b.
