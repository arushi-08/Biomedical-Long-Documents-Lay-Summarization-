 networks from high throughput data sets such as those generated by RNAi screens or CRISPR knockout experiments. These results will help guide future studies aimed at understanding mechanisms underlying cellular processes including growth control pathways involved in tumorigenesis. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > epistasis mapping, synthetic lethality screening, mitotic progression regulation, RAS signalling cascade, epigenetic regulators < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Genetic variants can interact epistatically (i.e. they influence each other's effect) resulting either additive or non-additively modified phenotype outcomes [2 – 4]. In addition, some combinations may be lethal while others result only partially affected; thus leading to ‘ fractional ’ penetrance when compared against their individual components. Such complexity has made identifying causal alleles difficult using traditional approaches based solely upon association analysis but also hinders our ability to understand genotype → pheno associations accurately enough so as not to miss important modifiers whose contribution might otherwise go unnoticed due to small sample sizes. To address both issues, several methods were developed over recent years aiming towards systematically characterizing pairwise genome × environment interactions across different conditions through systematic perturbation assays followed up via quantitative measurements under controlled experimental settings. One example was recently published where authors performed two independent siRNA knockdown screenings targeting 6 0 8 kinases simultaneously along with three chemical perturbations affecting microtubule dynamics combined into one assay measuring proliferation rates after 7 days post transfection. They identified 3 5 kinase pairs displaying significant negative synergistic drug − target pair scores indicating potential new targets associated with sensitivity toward anti tubulin drugs. Another group reported similar work focusing specifically on chromosome segregation defects following simultaneous depletion of 9 1 proteins implicated in kinetochore function together with six additional siRNAs directed against known tumour suppressors causing aneuploidy. Authors found many novel candidate drivers regulating spindle assembly checkpoint activity highlighting again the importance of studying genomic alterations within biological contexts rather than isolated systems alone. A third report focused instead more broadly onto DNA damage response revealing hundreds of positive hits interacting synergistically among them suggesting extensive crosstalk amongst repair factors acting redundantly even though most did not display any obvious connection directly related to DDR signaling itself. Finally, another screen combining five shRNAs per well targeted against ∼ 1 0% of all annotated mouse phosphatases resulted in identification of numerous previously unknown phosphatase substrates providing insights about phosphorylation events controlling key developmental decisions like stem cell maintenance versus differentiation programs. All above examples highlight once further the need to perform comprehensive analyses involving various types of perturbational agents covering diverse molecular functions operating throughout distinct stages of biology ranging from early embryonic patterning until adult tissue homeostasis. Thus far however there remains no general framework allowing researchers working independently without prior knowledge to identify statistically enriched patterns linking specific genotypes to particular classes of perturbed traits thereby enabling prioritization efforts especially if few samples exist available for testing given limited resources devoted to performing follow ups tests. Furthermore, although computational tools allow predicting likely candidates emerging out of global datasets obtained experimentally, validation steps remain necessary before drawing conclusions regarding causality behind observed phenomena. For instance, despite being able to predict thousands of possible deleterious allele carriers thanks to population sequencing projects still very little information exists concerning whether individuals carrying certain rare missense changes would exhibit altered physiological parameters nor what could potentially explain why patients harbouring identical heterozygous loss-of- function germline variations present variable clinical manifestations depending perhaps on environmental influences. Therefore developing robust analytical frameworks capable of prioritizing putative causative links arising out of massive amounts of heterogeneous omics data collected routinely today represents critical challenges facing modern biomedical science. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Recently, Boettcher et al. proposed a strategy called Synthetic Lethality Screening coupled with Next Generation Sequencing (SLSN + NGS) whereby shRNA libraries containing pooled short hairpin RNAs designed around predicted essential transcripts derived from whole exome sequences of patient tumours undergo massively parallel deep resequencing pre- vs. postselection pressure induced apoptosis triggered by treatment with cytotoxic compounds commonly employed clinically. Their proof-of principle experiment successfully demonstrated feasibility of detecting somatic homozygous deletions conferring selective advantage to tumor clones exposed to chemotherapy underscoring its utility for discovering therapeutic vulnerabilities linked to oncogenic lesions driving malignant transformation. Although promising initial observations suggest promise, much larger cohorts must first accumulate evidence demonstrating reproducibility and robustness of this methodology particularly since current state-of art technologies do neither guarantee complete coverage of coding regions nor enable detection of copy number variation occurring outside exons altogether limiting applicability beyond tumors exhibiting strong mutational signatures caused primarily by defective mismatch repair.As part of ongoing effort addressing limitations inherent to existing methodologies described here, we sought to develop alternative strategies amenable to rapid implementation applicable regardless of species studied hence facilitating discovery process irrespective of availability of sufficient numbers of pre-selected specimens required for implementing SLSNs protocols currently restricted mainly to humans. Towards achieving this goal, we set forth to devise a simple yet effective workflow relying exclusively on standard laboratory equipment readily accessible to virtually anybody willing to participate in basic sciences laboratories interested in deciphering mechanistic aspects underpinning fundamental biologic questions. Specifically, we reasoned that exploiting combinatorial knockdowns employing commercially available reagents should facilitate generation of unbiased maps uncovering functionally coherent groups of
