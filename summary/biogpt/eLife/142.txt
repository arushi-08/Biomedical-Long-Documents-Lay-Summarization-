 Comment on: "A general theory explaining why integral membranes prefer liquid over gel states [Phys Rev E 9 0, 2 4 6 1 3 5]" By combining atomistic simulations with continuum modeling based upon Landau's free energies, Hess et al. have shown explicitly how lipids can stabilize both fluid lamellar domains at low temperatures and solid crystalline domain structures above their critical temperature T c = 8 7 K. Their results suggest possible mechanisms underlying biological processes involving changes in cell shape during mitosis, endocytosis / exocytosis events and fusion reactions among cells. In addition, using coarse grained models combined with dissipative particle dynamics methods, Kusumi & Fujita showed directly how lateral pressure profiles across phospholipid monolayers depend strongly not only on composition but also on local curvature induced either mechanically through stretching deformations or chemically via adsorption onto curved surfaces. They found evidence suggesting that mechanical stresses may be involved in triggering some types of cellular signaling pathways associated with apoptosis induction following exposure to certain drugs used against cancer Cells. These authors point out further potential applications including drug delivery systems where controlled release might occur when applied stress exceeds threshold values ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ ▃ < SECTION > < FREETEXT > Discussion ▃ Our model system consists of one single chain molecule immersed into water which has been described previously As discussed earlier, our choice was motivated primarily due to its simplicity compared to more realistic descriptions like MARTINI All three chains studied here exhibit similar behavior; namely, there exists a sharp increase in density near the boundary separating regions occupied respectively by the polar heads and nonpolar tails. For all cases considered so far it appears reasonable to assume that the ordering effects observed close to the boundaries correspond mainly to interactions within individual molecules rather then collective ones. However, since most experiments involve mixtures containing several different components, e.g. amphiphilic peptides interacting simultaneously with phospholipids, mutual influences must necessarily exist. Thus, although the qualitative features remain unchanged qualitatively, quantitative differences do appear To summarize briefly, while many aspects still need clarification regarding specific details related to particular examples chosen herein, overall agreement seems quite good given what already existed before us started doing them. It should however be noted again that even though the exact nature of interaction potentials remains unknown beyond doubt, simple analytical arguments seem sufficient enough to explain key properties presented below without any fitting parameters being introduced. Moreover, if necessary additional information about detailed physical phenomena would require much higher computational power currently available today. Nevertheless, despite remaining uncertainties concerning precise chemical structure, relative sizes and shapes of various parts of interest will likely continue to play important roles throughout future work. Finally, considering just four representative amphiphiles having very distinct structural characteristics -i.e. length scales ranging roughly from tens down to hundreds nm, hydrophobicity varying considerably along sequence -, yet exhibiting remarkably consistent behaviors suggests that conclusions drawn heretofore hold true regardless of specifics. Overall, therefore, we believe that the current study provides useful insights toward understanding fundamental principles governing self organization driven solely by entropic considerations under conditions typically encountered experimentally. While acknowledging limitations inherent in purely theoretical approaches, especially relating specifically to sampling efficiency, we hope that the ideas developed therein serve well towards guiding experimental efforts aimed ultimately at probing complex biomolecular assemblies whose formation involves interplay amongst multiple factors acting synergistically together. Indeed, recent advances in high throughput techniques capable of providing simultaneous measurements of thousands of variables per experiment make feasible systematic studies addressing questions pertaining to increasingly intricate problems requiring careful consideration of multi parameter dependencies. Such investigations include investigation of peptide aggregation kinetics, folding equilibria, conformational transitions etc. On another note, we wish to emphasize once again that no attempt were made presently to address issues raised recently elsewhere Regarding implications for biology, particularly interesting possibilities emerge whenever new data become accessible allowing direct comparison with predictions derived theoretically Here, we focus exclusively on thermodynamic quantities characterizing equilibrium configurations sampled around initial points corresponding to fully extended conformations of selected polypeptides placed inside aqueous solution surrounded by pure DOPC matrix forming planar supported lipidic layers. Although confined environments offer unique opportunities enabling control of external stimuli affecting conformation distributions, care needs to taken nonetheless to ensure proper treatment of solvent fluctuations Effects resulting from thermal agitation alone cannot account quantitatively for non trivial deviations seen in Fig. Another notable feature emerging clearly from Figs Figs1 1b and and2b2b concerns dependence of P m * vs. N w obtained numerically versus dimensionless number densities reported in Table One way to rationalize discrepancies appearing in Tables Tables1a1a and and2 2a relates to variations occurring in effective volume fractions V eff defined according to Eq. 1. f v i represents fraction of hydrocarbon region covered by polypeptide segments belonging to n th type of amino acid residues.
