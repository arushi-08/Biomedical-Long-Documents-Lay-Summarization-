 devices based on iron oxide nanoparticles coated with proteins such as transferrin (Hsieh & Chen 2 0 1 4).These particles can be used both inside living organisms where there may not exist any background diamagnetic susceptibility but also outside them when exposed to strong static external magnets. However, even if one could design artificial "molecular machines ” using engineered ferritins attached at specific locations within cell membranes we would still need much more than just simple proof-ofprinciple experiments before considering practical applications. In addition, some recent studies suggest possible effects caused solely through thermal changes induced during exposure to-“ weak ac / dc} -oriented alternating current magnetic fields.Such observations raise serious questions about whether all observed responses were due only to direct interaction between applied AC electric currents and--especially under high frequency-- DC magnetic filed. A number of papers published since our last review article appear now reporting unexpected results which seem incompatible with--and cannot easily explain by--the mechanisms suggested above. For example, two groups showed very similar behavior despite completely opposite directions of application of the same type of oscillating electromagnetic radiation [see e.g.].The paper by Wang etal.2 0 1 3 describes surprising observation concerning effect of low frequency pulsed radio waves upon human blood lymphocytes proliferation rate while another study shows no significant change whatsoever after applying identical treatment ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ ▃ < SECTION > < FREETEXT > Discussion ▃ We should note here again several important points raised earlier in my discussion section entitled "Possible reasons why many experimental data obtained so far don't fit into theoretical models developed previously" Our conclusion seems rather untenable because most previous works did neither consider nor take account either temperature dependence of dielectric constant ε r associated with water molecule reorientation dynamics or possibility of non-equilibrium state formation near interfaces involving strongly dipolar ions. As pointed out elsewhere, the latter phenomenon might play crucial role particularly in case of charged macromolecules interacting via long range Coulomb forces To summarize briefly below what follows logically needs clarification. First, the mechanism described by us requires extremely slow relaxation time τ = e − βE eff ≈ s ≫ μs whereas τc ~ cη d exp {β D + γ B T} ≪ ms usually considered typical value for bulk liquid phase relaxations. www.nature.com / scientificreports www.nature.com / scientificReports / Second, although theoretically predicted, experimentally proven existence of nonequilibrium states formed around surfaces containing highly polar species remains elusive until today Experimental evidence suggesting presence of metastable interfacial regions having unusual properties including higher density compared to surrounding fluid phases exists already quite early On top of general limitations discussed throughout this manuscript lies lack of knowledge pertaining details related specifically to physical parameters governing interactions among various components involved in biomolecule response to externally imposed mechanical stress. Although detailed information available nowadays allows drawing conclusions useful mainly qualitatively, quantitative understanding will require further development along lines outlined herein. One obvious direction involves determination of characteristic times characterizing processes taking place over wide ranges of temperatures and frequencies corresponding respectively to viscous flow regime characterized primarily by viscosity coefficient μ v ∼ mPa • S -1 vs. inertial shear thinning region dominated predominantly by dynamic friction factor ζ ∝ ν t α ev ≡ μV dt -α vω → ∞ regimes. At present however, limited availability of appropriate tools makes systematic investigation difficult unless new techniques become readily accessible. Another major challenge concerns identification of key factors determining relative importance of each particular process contributing significantly towards overall biomolecular reaction kinetics occurring simultaneously in solution medium comprising multiple reacting partners undergoing simultaneous motion driven mechanically by force vector acting normal to surface plane. Finally, given complexity inherent to real system consisting of numerous chemical reactions operating concurrently in aqueous environment subject to influence exerted by intense electrical potential gradient across its interface, mathematical modeling approaches providing realistic description of underlying physicochemical events remain unavailable thus preventing formulation of reliable predictive model capable explaining entire spectrum of measured outcomes. Nevertheless, existing computational methods allowing simulation of single step bimolecular association event leading up to final product Formation of transient intermediate products resulting directly from initial encounter between reactant pairs followed by subsequent rearrangement steps appears unlikely except perhaps cases wherein reactants possess complementary charge distribution facilitating electrostatic attraction. Thus, currently accepted view holds that initially produced short lived intermediates tend to undergo rapid diffusion away from contact point thereby limiting probability of forming stable covalent bonds required ultimately for completion of catalytic cycle. Consequently, kinetic rates expected for individual elementary stages constituting complete enzymatic turnover typically fall well beyond those actually detected Experimentally determined values describing magnitude of net dipole moment µ o calculated according Eq. 7 vary widely depending mostly on method employed for calculation procedure. Values ranging form approximately zero down to tens of Debye length scale indicate substantial contribution made by permanent dipoles arising naturally apart from hydrogen bonding network responsible for maintaining native conformation of biomolecules. Interestingly enough, average distance separating nearest neighbors estimated assuming random arrangement of amino acids residues located close together does show remarkable agreement with distances derived independently from X ray diffraction measurements performed on crystals grown from pure solutions of isolated proteinsindicating similarity between structure features deduced computationally and reality. Therefore, taken collectively, structural characteristics inferred from experiment support validity of assumptions underpinning derivation of
