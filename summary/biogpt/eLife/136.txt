We believe that combining optimized enzymatic digestions coupled with advanced analytical methods will be useful across multiple fields where cellular heterogeneity plays key roles including immunology but also cancer biology, neuroscience and developmental studies. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
