 can help researchers identify them from neuroimaging data without recourse to computational models. The study also demonstrates an approach for identifying brain regions involved with other cognitive processes using fMRI during choice tasks where multiple outcomes may be available simultaneously but not necessarily valued equally: e.g. learning about rewards versus punishers; deciding which option is most likely to lead one's life ahead given uncertainty regarding long-term outcome benefits / costs; making complex judgments such as those required before taking action on social issues like voting preferences. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < ABSTRACT > < FREETEXT > Economic behavior involves both immediate actions taken immediately after receiving information concerning options ’ characteristics [1 – 3] plus longer deliberations needed to evaluate their relative merits once they become known. For example, people might decide among hypothetical lotteries based solely upon probabilities associated with each possible alternative rather then weighing expected monetary returns against anticipated regret if certain winnings were lost due to bad luck — i.e. “win less money ” leads some individuals down another course while others would accept all offers regardless of probability distribution. Similarly, many real world situations involve trade offs across different dimensions including quality vs. quantity attributes related directly to individual items themselves vs features linked indirectly through larger groups whose members share common interests. In addition, there exists considerable variability within populations even though we know little about what makes us good players - perhaps because our brains evolved under conditions far removed from modern society itself. This suggests either substantial flexibility built up early enough so that human evolution did not require any particular solutions nor strong constraints imposed late in development allowing everybody to adopt optimal strategies quickly yet still maintain stability throughout adult lifespan despite ever changing environments. Indeed, recent work has shown great inter subject consistency in behavioral performance following training sessions designed specifically to improve specific aspects of judgment and problem solving ability. Such studies suggest that neural systems supporting simple perceptual discrimination abilities show remarkable plasticity enabling rapid adaptation depending critically on environmental demands whereas higher level cognition appears relatively stable although its capacity remains malleable via experience dependent mechanisms involving synaptic modification. It follows therefore that understanding why someone chooses something else will depend crucially on knowing exactly who made his initial investment prior to acquiring new knowledge. But beyond providing insight into basic psychological principles underlying rational thought, neuroscience could potentially shed light onto important practical problems facing humanity today ranging from improving educational practices aimed at promoting better mental health amongst children towards developing novel approaches toward treating addiction disorders. To date however, few attempts exist linking functional imaging results obtained whilst subjects make difficult multi attribute judgements to actual behaviors observed afterwards. We report here experiments investigating differences in activity patterns recorded concurrently in key cortical areas implicated previously in various forms of sequential reasoning paradigms used extensively outside laboratory settings. Specifically, we investigated responses evoked by sequentially presented pairs consisting initially of positive stimuli followed shortly thereafter by negative ones paired randomly intermixed along three levels corresponding respectively to high gain $5 0 chance success rate, low loss opportunity $2% failure likelihood and intermediate values representing uncertain states requiring further evaluation. Subjects had no explicit instruction whatsoever.Our aim was first to determine whether distinct hemodynamic response profiles reflecting subjective valuing tendencies reflect momentary preference shifts occurring around critical points in sequence presentation thereby revealing dissociating roles played by frontal lobe structures identified earlier in similar experimental contexts. Second, since previous reports indicate greater sensitivity of ventral striatum activation compared to dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) deactivation to changes in incentive salience arising out of feedback processing events, we sought evidence indicating differential involvement of striatal sub nuclei underpinning valuation according tos valence dimension. Finally, we examined effects relating to temporal delay preceding final payoff delivery thus probing contributions of fronto parietal networks subserving working memory functions concerned primarily with maintaining representations of recently acquired contingencies alongside ongoing monitoring requirements necessary for evaluating current state accordingly. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All procedures conformed strictly to local ethical guidelines approved by Loughborough University Ethics Committee and written informed consent received from every participant included in the experiment. Participants gave verbal assent whenever appropriate. A total number n = 4 8 healthy volunteers participated voluntarily aged range 1 9 − 6 7 years old recruited online anonymously. Exclusion criteria comprised history of neurological illness affecting motor control or sensory perception assessed clinically by means of standard clinical tests administered separately to assess presence of focal lesions confirmed radiologically by MRI scans performed routinely pre scan screening procedure. No significant difference emerged comparing age distributions of male & female participants.There were four major categories comprising students attending university courses, staff employed full time jobs unrelated to psychology departments, employees engaged part time job positions mainly performing administrative duties etc … None reported having been diagnosed currently suffering psychiatric illnesses. Each volunteer completed five runs per session totaling twenty trials distributed evenly spread across six blocks. Blocks consisted of twelve consecutive trial types arranged pseudo random order resulting in sixteen repetitions overall yielding thirty minutes duration scanning run length. Trials began with fixation cross appearing centrally flanked above left side corner marking screen center.
