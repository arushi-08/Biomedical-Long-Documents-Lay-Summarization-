 strain with an efficiency up to 1 5 times greater than wild type phages at low multiplicity infection ratios.

For example, mutation N1 2 4 shows strong preference towards serine over other amino acids when targeting E. coli but no obvious pattern otherwise When considering only those cases where substitution did occur within each variant library independently from others' selections, there appears little correlation observed between any given mutant selection value and either sequence identity nor phylogenetic distance amongst selected organisms (Figure S1 3). These observations suggest both convergent evolution due to similar selective pressures acting on particular residues under various conditions as well as possible non-neutral evolutionary processes operating differently according to environmental factors beyond phylogeny alone. Overall, while most mutants had comparable fitness values regardless of organism used during screening, several notable exceptions exist including two sites showing differential behavior dependent solely on one bacterium being screened out of multiple possibilities. One site lies near the N terminus of the RBD region known to interact directly with LPS molecules present on cell surfaces While more work remains necessary to understand why distinct RBDs behave so dramatically here compared to previous studies involving diverse receptors, future experiments could focus specifically on identifying key interactions responsible for altered phenotypes via directed evolution approaches. Finally, despite having fewer examples found thus far outside T4, we note that three additional locations also appear important for proper folding stability of the full length proteins since none can tolerate even conservative changes without losing functionality. As expected, changing proline codons generally resulted in loss of viability suggesting structural constraints imposed by prolines throughout the entire gene. Interestingly though, mutating P1 6 7 located just upstream of helix αD does result in viable clones indicating tolerance to change around this location. Further investigation will help elucidate what roles this may play structurally and functionally. Taken together, these analyses highlight numerous areas critical for understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotypic variation seen in nature. With continued improvements made regarding experimental techniques and computational tools available today, further exploration should continue unabated. Ultimately, combining large datasets like ours along side advances already existing technologies paving way forward novel ways to study complex biological systems. < / FREETEXT > < / EXP > ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃
