 molecules (e.g. CD2) bind antigen presenting MHC class II proteins on APCs while costimulatory receptors interact with ligands expressed by activated APC [2 – 4]. Following initial interaction between TCR / CD3 complex and peptide loaded MHCII protein complexes at an immunological synapse formed upon contact between naïve lymphocytes and dendritic or other professional phagocytes expressing cognate antigens, additional interactions occur involving accessory signaling pathways such as those mediated through B7 family members CD8 0 & CD8 6 which can be either positive regulators of immune reactions via their engagement with CTLA-4Ig fusion constructs used therapeutically against autoimmune diseases or negative modulators when engaged directly within lymphoid organs. In addition to providing costimulation, ligation of coinhibitory receptor PD-L1 results in inhibition of proliferation and cytokine production among virus specific memory cytotoxic T lymphocyte populations resulting in impaired control over chronic infections including HIV and hepatitis C Virus.. While many studies have focused primarily on early events associated with naive Th precursor generation into mature effectors capable of mounting effective immunity to pathogens, less attention was paid towards understanding mechanisms involved later stages once primed Th1 7 subsets were established under conditions promoting inflammation. This may reflect lack of knowledge about factors regulating long term survival of differentiated Th2 lineages despite evidence suggesting they play key roles both locally and systemically throughout life supporting tissue homeostasis but potentially contributing significantly toward inflammatory pathologies observed across multiple disease states ranging from asthma exacerbations to autoimmunity. Thus far there remains limited information regarding molecular regulation governing development and stability of polarized functional subtypes amongst different TH lineage sub groups although recent work suggests plasticity exists even late stage committed TH1 7s perhaps reflecting heterogeneity present earlier along developmental trajectories prior to commitment to particular fates. For example IL-1β produced endogenously promotes conversion of human peripheral blood derived TH9 precursors isolated ex vivo into IFN γ producing progeny whereas exogenous TGF β induces iTr1s secreting high levels of IL1 0 without losing capacity to produce IFNγ indicating environmental cues influence fate decisions made post clonal selection. Similarly TGFβ drives murine TH2 subset maturation whilst exposure to IL4 alone does so only transiently implying epigenetic changes occurring subsequent to primary stimulation might impact phenotype outcome. However little progress had been achieved until recently due largely to technical limitations preventing analysis beyond transcriptional profiling using microarrays thus limiting our ability to identify regulatory networks controlling phenotypic outcomes downstream of cellular programming programs initiated immediately following encounter with activating stimuli. Recently however advances enabling genome wide analyses now allow us access detailed insights into gene transcription patterns underlying diverse biological processes thereby allowing identification of genes whose products contribute critically to phenotypes defined experimentally based approaches rather than simply being markers defining them functionally. Here we describe experiments designed specifically aimed at determining if persistent presence of one member of the large group of structurally related transmembrane glycoproteins termed “immunoglobulin superfamily ” plays any significant part in modulating adaptive host defense strategies mounted by immunocompetent hosts challenged acutely with infectious agents. Members include CD5 3, CD6 2L, CD1 5 0, LAG-3l etc … Although all share similar structural features comprising extracellular N terminal V like domains linked sequentially to C2 set membrane proximal regions containing conserved cysteine residues thought likely responsible for formation intramolecular disulfide bonds followed finally by short intracellular tails bearing tyrosine motifs implicated in signal transduction activity, each individual glycoprotein exhibits unique pattern of distribution depending on location relative to plasma membranes. These differences suggest possible specialized activities conferred by differential subcellular localization arising out of selective ligand binding properties combined with restricted availability dictated by rates of constitutive internalization coupled with differing kinetics of re-synthesis making interpretation difficult given potential redundancy inherent in some families. Indeed previous reports indicate disparate effects exerted by various IgSF members dependent on site of action i.e. soluble versus immobilized forms acting respectively as inhibitors vs. activators of leukocyte migration.Our data demonstrate sustained surface presentation of another representative member of the same subfamily namely CD2 8i (aka ICOSL) contributes importantly to establishment of protective anti microbial humoral immunities particularly affecting B cell- driven antibody isotype switching. Importantly though loss of CD2 8i did affect overall magnitude of IgG titers elicited albeit no effect could be detected on IgM secretion arguing normal numbers of germinal centers developed normally hence further emphasizing importance played by CD2 8i selectively influencing secondary diversification steps leading up to final affinity matureing of antibodies secreted by switched plasmablasts. It should nevertheless be noted here that reduced serum IgG1 concentrations seen in infected Cd2 8a − / y animals compared to WT controls do correlate well with diminished frequencies of GC forming B2 2 0hi CD9 5lo GL7- PNA low centroblasts found in spleens harvested from chronically infected mutant mice.Interestingly, total number of splenic GCs per mouse appeared unaffected since frequency distributions obtained comparing mean values calculated separately for wild types vs knockouts showed statistically indistinguishable means confirming equal efficiency of immunization protocols employed irrespective of genotype status. Further investigation revealed comparable proportions of Tfh cells developing comparably regardless genotypes consistent with observations reported previously showing equivalent percentages of CXCR5- Bcl6- PD1 + TFH population develop independent of ICOS signalling pathway. Moreover, absolute counts determined similarly indicated numerically identical amounts of circulating Tfh cells recovered from lymph nodes draining sites inoculated subcutaneously with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding ovalbumin representing strong antigenic stimulus driving robust induction ofTfhs.Taken together these finding imply defects exhibited by Cd28b deficient mutants lie distal to initiation phase yet before completion of germinal center
