 but rather within an allele itself via heritable changes in histone modification patterns. This suggests that stable maintenance of transcriptional programs requires both cis- and trans- mechanisms acting on distinct regulatory elements present across multiple alleles simultaneously.

In mammals there appears little evidence supporting transgenerational transmission of any type of epigenetically mediated information beyond imprinted loci where parent specific monoallelic silencing results either directly due to differential imprinting control regions associated promoters being differentially methylated between paternal and female gametes prior to gametogenesis or indirectly because some paternally expressed transcripts encode small RNAs which silence corresponding mRNAs transcribed biallelically early post conception (Reik et al., 2 0 0 1; Surani et al., 2 0 0 7b; Jullien et al., 2 0 0 8a; Kishore & Stadler, 2 0 0 8b; Guerrero ‐ Santoro et al., 2 0 0 9a; Borgel et al., 2 0 1 0a; Feil et al., 2 0 1 0b; Kaneda et al., 2 0 1 1a; Yagi et al., 2 0 1 1b). Similarly no clear examples exist suggesting similar types of molecular mechanism operate throughout eukaryotes despite widespread conservation among organisms ranging from yeast to humans regarding most aspects involved including enzymes responsible for establishing repressive marks like H3K2 7me3 catalyzed by polycomb group complexes PRC1 – EZH2 complex members (Cao et al., 2 0 0 2b; Czermin et al., 2 0 0 2a; Kuzmichev et al., 2 0 0 3a; Muller et al., 2 0 0 2; van der Stoop et al., 2 0 0 7a; Boyer et al., 2 0 0 6a; Schwartz et al., 2 0 0 6b; Simon & Lange, 2 0 0 8; Wang et al., 2 0 0 9b; Agger et al., 2 0 0 9c; Margueron & Reinberg, 2 0 1 1; Scelfo et al., 2 0 1 2). It therefore seems likely that different species utilize alternative strategies depending largely on availability of resources needed over time since each organism must survive under very diverse conditions requiring rapid adaptation responses involving large numbers of genetic variants generated every generation. For example Drosophila melanogaster relies heavily on transposon activity whereas Caenorhabditis elegans rely more strongly on RNA interference pathways although neither system require extensive genomic rearrangements unlike vertebrates whose entire germline epigenome undergoes massive remodeling shortly after birth resulting in global loss of heterochromatin structure concomitant with major increases in transposable element content observed postnatally compared to embryos (Aravin et al., 2 0 0 9; Grewal & Moazed, 2 0 0 3b; Zeller et al., 2 0 1 0; Ashe et al., 2 0 1 2; Buckley et al., 2 0 1 2; Duret, 2 0 1 2; Garrigues et al., 2 0 1 2; Hacketts et al., 2 0 1 2; Rougemaille et al., 2 0 1 2; Seisenberger et al., 2 0 1 2; Zhang et al., 2 0 1 2c). While all multicellular life forms share common features related to germ line specification and subsequent propagation using specialized stem cells capable of producing differentiated progeny, differences do emerge relating primarily to complexity of reproductive structures used along generations leading up to sexual maturity allowing greater flexibility in response times necessary given changing environments encountered daily around our planetary surface. Indeed recent studies suggest significant variation exists even amongst closely related taxa indicating considerable evolutionary plasticity may occur without compromising fitness per se underscoring potential importance of understanding underlying mechanistic details governing epigenomic regulation particularly those operating outside embryonic stages critical for survival into adulthood especially considering increasing anthropogenic influences impacting human habitation worldwide raising concerns about possible effects arising out of altered modes of communication systems affecting health outcomes linked to disease susceptibility and longevity rates seen today relative to previous eras (Prud'homme et al., 2 0 0 5b; Ewald et al., 2 0 1 0; McGrath et al., 2 0 1 1; Tian et al., 2 0 1 1; Manning et al., 2 0 1
