 who could help us understand hematopoiesis at an organismal level as well as its evolution across animal phyla. © 2 0 1 8 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, there exist significant differences among vertebrates regarding their anatomy compared to invertebrates like flies whose body plan shares striking similarities when considering organ size distribution, number of tissues per segment etc.. Furthermore, while mammals possess multiple lineages capable of producing mature erythrocytes from pluripotent progenitors called hemangioblasts present within mesodermal germ layers early in embryogenesis they lack definitive hematopoeisis later in ontogeny due primarily to apoptosis mediated removal of primitive erythroid precursors before birth; instead most mammalian adults rely solely on yolk sac derived erythro myeloid progenitor populations residing mainly along vascular endothelial surfaces lining bone marrow cavities. These latter multipotent precursor pools give rise exclusively into granulocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells etc. via lineage restricted intermediates termed “Colony Forming Unit Erythroid ” -Granulocytic Macrophage CFU E ’ s GMP's GM's respectively giving them access to red versus white blood forming potential depending largely on environmental cues encountered post implantation. While some studies suggest even more complex hierarchies involving multi potent lymphoid primed multipotency state HSCs being able to generate other classes of immune competent progeny than those described above others argue against HSC based models since only one type of lymphocyte - B lymphocytes was found to be generated directly without any apparent intermediate stage resembling either T helper or cytotoxic effector subsets suggesting alternative mechanisms may underlie lymphogenesis under physiological conditions. It should also come out clear however that our understanding of human physiology cannot simply extrapolates information obtained experimentally utilizing mouse genetics because humans differ significantly physiologically relative to rodents especially concerning metabolism and reproductive biology. Thus far no study employing invertebrate genetic approaches designed specifically aimed toward addressing questions related to hematology would appear available although several groups recently reported successful transgenesis strategies allowing manipulation of genes encoding key regulators controlling various aspects of fly immunity making use of GAL4 enhancer trap lines expressing fluorescent proteins selectively marking hemocytes e.g. lamellocytes, prophenoloxidase activating system (PPS) containing melanotic tumors, fat bodies associated phagocytes, circulating phagocytic macrophage population etc … < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Although recent work suggests evolutionary conservation exists amongst insects pertaining to fundamental cellular functions required for innate host defense responses following infection i.e. phagocytosis, encapsulation reactions..., major gaps remain relating particularly to regulation of humoral factors produced locally around sites of pathogen entry thereby enabling efficient clearance of invading organisms prior to dissemination beyond local foci. For example, Toll pathway activation leads ultimately to production of antimicrobial peptides secreted systemically resulting in killing bacteria whereas RNAi pathways mediate antiviral defenses presumably acting predominantly intracellularly thus preventing systemic spread of virus particles outside infected hosts. As mentioned earlier, unlike higher metazoans lacking adaptive arms races, insect genomes encode numerous homologs belonging to gene families coding for pattern recognition receptors recognizing microbial patterns expressed abundantly extracellularly leading eventually to induction of downstream effectors mediating opsonization followed by complement cascade induced lysis of pathogens inside phagosomes. On another front, comparative genomics reveals remarkable similarity existing betweenD. Melanogaster genome sequence and sequences corresponding to loci implicated previously in regulating murine myelopoietic programs implying common ancestry underlying conserved regulatory networks governing leukocyte function. Indeed, two independent reports demonstrated generation of functionally active neutrophils ex vivo starting form purified CD3 4pos cord blood mononuclear fractions isolated from umbilical cords providing evidence supporting presence of bona fide granulocyte generating compartments akin to what had long ago emerged as dogma surrounding origin of leukocytes originating from mesoderm derivatives. Moreover, similar observations were made independently demonstrating ability of FACS sorted Lin neg c kit + Sca − 1hi CD1 1b low Gr-1a high Mac-2lo CD4 5dim BM fraction enriched for putative HSCs to differentiate efficiently towards monocytes and DCs indicating possible commonality existed behind molecular control circuits operating upstream of different branches of granulocytopoiesis vs. monocytopoiesis.This observation prompted further investigation aiming identification of transcription factor candidates responsible for driving expression of specific sets of target genes.The first report identified C / EBP family members PU.1 & SPI1 playing critical roles directing monocyte fate specification whilst subsequent analysis revealed involvement of Ikaros protein encoded byIkzf1 together withGata2 specifying DC identity. More importantly though, elegant experiments performed simultaneously led investigators concluding absence ofIrf8 activity resulted in failure of proper maturation
