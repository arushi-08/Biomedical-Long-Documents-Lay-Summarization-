It should however still remain possible that undiagnosed asthmatics might go undetected because spirometric tests can easily become uncomfortable especially while breathing cold air leading them either avoid going out doors where ventilation levels tend low or travel long distances away before seeking medical care. Furthermore although all subjects underwent skin prick test screening prior to inclusion in the studynone received allergy treatment nor did anybody receive further follow up after diagnosis except for two patients whose parents refused participation following informed consent obtainment. Finally since most households surveyed resided around Lake Victoria then likely exposure occurred mainly inland hence limiting extrapolation beyond local areas.This investigation does highlight important differences regarding geographical distribution patterns observed previously elsewhere particularly relating to household location suggesting different underlying causes driving variations seen internationally. Further investigations will need to focus on determining whether genetic variation plays role in explaining regional disparities identified herein. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Globally approximately half million deaths annually occur attributable toAcute Lower Airway Infections (ALAIs) affecting primarily infants aged less thatly.1 Whilst many infections resolve without consequence others progress towards Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) characterised byairflow limitation caused predominantly via inflammation inflicting damage onAirways smooth muscle cells resulting fromcontraction causing narrowing of airways reducing flow rate throughout.3 Although much attention focusses upon cigarette smoking forTobacco smoke exposures.4 Other known causative agents includenallergens found commonly indoor wherewithbreathlessness often occurring.5 While previous epidemiological studies6 suggest links betweenin utero tobacco smokeExposure to domestic pets appears protective against development of severe bronchiolitis whereas maternal cat ownership increases risk.7 Indoor dampness seems linked to acute lower tract infection morbidity in children.8 Previous reviews indicate associations exist between poor housing quality indicators and incidence offood allergies in Europe.9 Recent systematic review suggests that residential proximity to major roads increase risks of developing atopic sensitisation and allergies.1 0 Despite increasing awareness surrounding pollution impacts worldwide little knowledge exists concerning impact thereafterOn child healthWorldwide burden estimates show highest mortality figures occurring in low- income countries1 1 yet few detailed descriptions characterising causal pathways underpinning global differentials observed1 2 even though over three billion adults reside therein. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > To date very limited published literature describes aetiological relationships linking outdoor pollutants to paediatric obstructive pulmonary disease.1 3 Most available publications describe adult cohorts thus leaving unanswered questions pertaining to causality mechanisms operating earlier in lifestyle.1 4 Given recent concerns raised about adverse consequences arising from rapid urbanization processes fuelled largely by industrialization coupled with
