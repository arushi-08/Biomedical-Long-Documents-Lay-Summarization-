 can help guide parasites through multiple steps required before invasion occurs (Figure 1); our results show that it also helps optimize parasite entry at sites distant from feeding mosquitoes' mouthparts. These observations reveal new mechanisms underlying malaria transmission across biological barriers as well as potential targets against disease-causing stages within humans or vectors.
