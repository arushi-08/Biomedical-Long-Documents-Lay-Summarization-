 force applied by an external pipette tip during recording. However, when auxiliary mechanical assistance was provided through application of negative pressures between − 5 kPa and -5 0 kPa relative to positive holding potentials within + 3 mV range using pipettes filled with solutions containing ~ 4 mM intracellular Ca 2 + concentration, there were significant increases in mean current amplitude for all tested conditions including those where expression level exceeded native values. These results suggest that while it does not affect intrinsic mechanosensitivity per se, increased local concentrations due to proximity can enhance mechanosensory function under certain circumstances such as near sites experiencing strong extracellular matrix compression associated with tissue remodeling after injury. This work provides new insights into mechanisms underlying mechanotransduction processes mediated primarily though direct interactions among individual proteins rather than indirect effects arising solely from changes in protein abundance across different cellular contexts. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction: ▃ Mechanotransduction refers broadly to our ability to convert physical stimuli sensed inside living organisms into biochemical signals detected outside them The molecular basis behind piezoelectricity remains controversial despite decades worth study In addition to being sensitive sensors of shear stress, many studies have shown that mammalian PIEZO currents exhibit outward rectification When expressed heterologously, human PIEZO1 exhibits similar biophysical properties To date most functional investigations of mechanoelectrical coupling rely upon heterologous overexpression systems; however, recent advances now allow us to probe directly whether any observed differences arise because they result simply from altered stoichiometry compared to their natural counterparts We recently reported single molecule localization measurements showing that overexpressed mouse Piezo clusters form larger assemblies Compared to previous reports suggesting that higher surface receptor number leads to greater whole-cell conductance For example, one report showed that increasing mPiez1α subunit copy number led to proportional increase in macroscopic current magnitude but decrease in unitary conductances Single particle tracking experiments also suggested clustering behavior consistent with formation of multiple independent units One possible explanation could be related to potential steric constraints imposed by neighboring molecules leading to reduced mobility As mentioned above, several groups proposed models whereby interaction partners might influence gating kinetics without affecting overall activation threshold Pressure responses measured here do appear qualitatively distinct from previously published ones based largely on recordings made following exposure to relatively long duration suction pulses (e.g. tens seconds) While some aspects remain unclear about what constitutes "normal physiology" versus pathology, understanding why specific disease mutations lead specifically to loss vs. gain of function phenotypes will likely require careful consideration of factors beyond simple change in total amount of active receptors present On top of providing information regarding basic principles governing electromechanical signaling events, quantitative analysis presented herein should help guide future efforts aimed toward developing therapeutic strategies targeting diseases caused either by loss- or gainoffunctionmutants. Indeed, given emerging evidence implicating dysregulation of stretch induced calcium influx pathways in pathological states like hypertension It would seem logical then if pharmacological agents designed to modulate activity of wild type Pieza subunits could prove useful therapeutically. Unfortunately currently available compounds tend to lack specificity since even small modifications alter potency significantly Another important question raised by our observations concerns the role played by cytoskeletal elements known to play key roles in regulating dynamic behaviors of plasma membranes Mechanical stresses experienced physiologically often occur over short time scales ranging down to milliseconds Although much less studied experimentally, theoretical modeling approaches offer valuable insight Intuitively appealing explanations include hypotheses involving allosteric modulation of pore opening triggered by conformational rearrangements initiated elsewhere Mechanically assisted potentiation arises naturally whenever two piezoceramic transducers placed close enough apart experience simultaneous deflection resulting in enhanced displacement transmission along the length of the cluster If so, perhaps only weak association exists between adjacent monomers allowing sufficient flexibility to accommodate deformation independently From another perspective, although unlikely, it seems plausible that Piez dimers located closer to each other undergo cooperative transitions more readily than distant pairs Given the complexity inherent in interpreting experimental outcomes obtained studying heterogeneous populations comprising mixtures of homomeric complexes formed out of identical components, computational simulation offers great promise as part of integrated approach combining experiment and theory towards gaining deeper mechanistic knowledge About half century ago Hodgkin & Huxley first developed cable equation formalism describing propagation velocity of action potentials Based on earlier mathematical analyses of voltage dependent sodium and potassium ionic flux rates A major challenge facing development of realistic multi scale model incorporating detailed structural details comes up with accurate representation of complex biological structures. Currently existing methods used today cannot accurately predict 3D geometry of macromolecular assembly owing mainly to limitations posed by resolution limits of imaging techniques Most importantly, until very few years back AFM images acquired routinely contain atomic coordinates required for reliable reconstruction of atomistic detail Molecular dynamics simulations represent powerful tool enabling investigation of microscopic phenomena occurring far away from equilibrium. They enable prediction of nanoscale motions taking place around biomolecules subject to thermal fluctuations generated by energy input. By simulating trajectories spanning hundreds of nanoseconds timescale, MD allows calculation of free energies corresponding to chemical reactions happening spontaneously At least three sets of parameters need to be tuned simultaneously before performing classical MD calculations -temperature T, volume V, and electrostatic charge q Electrostatic charges must ideally reproduce quantum mechanics electronic ground state wave functions calculated ab initio Quantum chemistry computations performed prior to starting conventional MD runs ensure proper description of system energetics and avoid spurious artifacts introduced by approximations employed During initial stages of equilibration process
