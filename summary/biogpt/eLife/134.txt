 can be used as an effective tool for promoting functional restoration after ischemic damage by enhancing activity levels within spared areas that may otherwise remain inactive due to increased expression / release ofendogenous inhibitors such asTIMPs. This article has implications beyond vision science: it provides insight into mechanisms underlying other forms of neural repair where similar processes occur during development when neuronal connections form between neurons located at different locations along axons called synapses. We also discuss potential therapeutic applications based onour results which could lead towards novel treatments aimed toward restoring function through use-driven synaptic remodeling rather than cell replacement strategies currently being explored using stem cells. © 2 0 1 6 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It allows us to adapt behavior according to environmental demands while maintaining stability over time. During early postnatal periods cortical networks exhibit high rates of spontaneous network events termed “Up ” states characterized electrophysiologically by large amplitude depolarizations lasting several seconds accompanied by action potentials. These up state transitions represent highly synchronized bursts originating primarily near layer IV followed later onto deeper layers. Experience plays important roles regulating developmental maturation of sensory cortices including ocular dominance columns, orientation selectivity maps, retinotopic mapping, whisker map formation etc. However, despite extensive studies investigating molecular factors involved in shaping developing brains there remains much unknown concerning cellular pathways mediating long term maintenance versus reorganization of mature circuitry. One key factor thought critical here involves matrix metalloproteinase enzymes (MMPs) whose proteolytic activities regulate extracellular protein turnover essential for normal growth cone motility, axon guidance, synaptogenesis, dendritic spine morphogenesis, myelination, neurogenesis etc. via cleavage of adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines, receptors, transcription regulators, cytoskeletal proteins, myelin components, proteoglycans, signaling ligands & antagonists. Although many aspects related to regulation of ECM dynamics still need clarification, recent evidence suggests involvement of specific members belonging to two major families -secreted gelatinases A + B (MMP2 − MMP9 collectively referred hereafter simply as" gelatinase "unless specified differently) and membrane type I collagenolytic matrixins MT1 − MTM5 (MMP1 − MMP5 respectively) - all expressed widely across various tissues. For example, genetic deletion experiments revealed distinct functions played out mainly by individual family member depending largely on tissue types studied e.g. MMP9- deficient mouse showed impaired angiogenesis whereas Mmp2- knockout had no effect On one hand, some reports suggest beneficial actions exerted by certain proteases like plasmin, thrombin, tPA, uPA, ADAM1 0 and others against acute insults leading to neurodegeneration While most work focused so far exclusively on studying short range interactions mediated mostly extracellularly, intracellular crosstalk exists too whereby activated caspases cleave substrates localized inside cytoplasm thereby triggering apoptosis either directly or indirectly via activating pro apoptotic kinases JNK and p3 8MAPK Here we investigate whether pharmacological manipulation targeting multiple classes of metalloproteases might affect neuroplasticity resulting in improved behavioral performance even months post ischemia onset thus providing insights potentially useful therapeutically. Specifically, since previous literature suggested detrimental consequences caused by upregulation of MMPs particularly those implicated in neuroinflammation i.e. TNFα converting enzyme TACE As expected given well established neuroprotective properties exhibited by minocycline Another goal was therefore to determine if any observed benefits were restricted only locally around infarct site vs. spreading systemically. Since blood vessels supplying cerebral hemispheres lie close together forming neurovascular units (NVU's) comprising endothelial lining surrounded by astrocytic endfeet ensheathed pericytes embedded amongst basement membranes, perivascular macrophages and microglia they constitute ideal targets for drug delivery approaches aiming specifically at modulating local microenvironment surrounding damaged area without harming neighboring regions unaffected by insult Thus, although numerous experimental models exist enabling investigation of complex phenomena taking place simultaneously in vivo, none fully recapitulate human disease progression nor do they allow direct translation back to humans. Therefore animal model systems must necessarily reflect pathological features seen clinically more closely then simple ones allowing better understanding of basic biological principles driving pathology before moving forward. Stroke represents perhaps best suited system because its etiology includes diverse causes ranging from vascular occlusion causing focal hypoperfusion culminating ultimately in infarction to metabolic disturbances inducing global hypoxia mimicking diffuse hypoxic encephalopathy often encountered in neonates. Moreover, unlike neurodegenerative diseases wherein progressive loss occurs gradually over years, strokes typically result in rapid deterioration requiring immediate medical attention making them amenable study subjects relatively easy to follow longitudinally. Furthermore, clinical presentation varies greatly reflecting severity of initial symptoms experienced acutely hence necessitating careful selection of appropriate rodent species and strains suitable for each experiment. Finally, available imaging techniques enable assessment of neurological deficits prior to death rendering longitudinal analysis possible permitting evaluation of efficacy of proposed therapies administered immediately postsurgery. Ischemic lesions produced experimentally mimic naturally occuring infarcts found commonly in patients suffering cerebrovascular accidents. Experimental paradigms employed include transient middle artery occlusions (tMCAO) producing unilateral hemispheric infarctions resembling lacunar syndromes in adults and neonatal periventricular hemorrhagic leukomalacia (PVL) modeling severe white matter damages frequently reported in premature infants. Both pathologies share common pathophysiological
