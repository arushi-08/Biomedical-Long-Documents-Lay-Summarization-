 role for regulating proteolysis. These results show that regulation is not essential but does enhance low level pathway activity induced by endogenous ligand; they suggest an important function for unregulated cleavage as part of homeostatic control rather than solely providing alternative means of generating active forms from inactive precursors during developmental patterning events where high concentrations of ligands may occur transiently. They further indicate distinct functions within the regulatory network controlling Ci / GLI protein stability: one involving direct inhibition via phosphorylation sites near the N terminus which promote degradation independent of other factors such as Su [fu] while another requiring both Fu kinase activities mediated primarily though its C terminal region including multiple CK1 priming phosphorylations followed by GSK3 action on adjacent residues promoting subsequent β − TrCP recruitment leading to ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction. Finally we found evidence suggesting differential sensitivity between different targets genes to partial loss of negative regulators like Sufu indicating differences among them regarding quantitative requirements for specific positive inputs into transcription complex formation downstream of Smo receptor engagement. This study provides new insights about molecular mechanism underlying quantitatively tuned responses to extracellular signals using physiologically appropriate experimental systems allowing us to distinguish effects due directly to altered biochemical properties versus indirect consequences resulting from perturbed cell fate decisions caused indirectly because of defects affecting tissue architecture. It thus reveals novel aspects of intracellular feedback loops operating under conditions similar those occurring naturally throughout animal evolution. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > hedgehog morphogen gradient, Smoothened GPCR G Protein Coupled Receptor, Signal Transduction Network, Proteolytic Processing, Transcriptional Regulation, Gene Expression Pattern, Wing Development, Fly Model System < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > A key feature distinguishing vertebrate Sonic hedgehog (Shh) -class members compared to invertebrate homologs is long range intercellular communication required for proper embryonic growth patterns along three orthogonal axes – anterior posterior axis, dorsal ventral axial polarity across tissues derived from all germ layers, and planar polarized epithelial morphogenesis associated specifically with neural tube closure processes 1 - 3. In contrast invertebrates have only short distance interactions 4, 5 consistent with simpler body plans 6. How do vertebrates achieve more sophisticated morphogenetic behaviors over shorter distances relative to insects despite having fewer molecules per secreting source 7? One possibility suggested previously was based upon observations made decades ago 8 demonstrating higher potency gradients formed after injection of increasing amounts of purified recombinant ShhNp polypeptide 9. However it has been difficult since then to determine whether any particular property intrinsic to individual secreted molecule contributes substantially toward determining overall biological response strength given comparable diffusion rates observed experimentally even if there might exist some correlation evident simply owing to increased effective concentration achieved following introduction of larger quantities of material. An additional complication arises from potential non-linearities inherent in many models describing relationships between input quantity and output intensity thereby complicating attempts to relate actual measured values obtained empirically to theoretical predictions generated mathematically assuming linearity. For example, mathematical modeling suggests that maximal induction occurs around intermediate doses whereas lower or greater dosage causes less efficient stimulation depending largely on parameters governing initial assembly steps involved in forming transcriptionally competent complexes containing DNA bound activator species together with co-activators recruited independently of each others ’ actions 1 0. Thus far no studies addressing possible contribution of unique features encoded uniquely amongst various family member polypeptides towards shaping qualitative outputs arising out of differing dosages applied exogenously could definitively address questions raised above concerning mechanistic basis behind qualitatively diverse outcomes seen in vivo vs. predicted behavior expected theoretically considering linear assumptions alone would seem unlikely. Moreover most previous experiments examining functional significance of post translational modifications known collectively referred to here as “modification ” had focused almost exclusively either on single amino acid substitutions introduced artificially without consideration being paid attention to what effect mutations actually exert on native structure so little information exists currently available relating structural alterations produced by mutation to consequent impact on biologically significant outcome measures beyond simple conclusions drawn merely according to empirical data collected routinely employing artificial constructs encoding modified versions lacking critical domains thought responsible functionally crucial. To begin exploring answers potentially provided by natural variation present within otherwise identical sequences representing evolutionarily conserved regions of homologous molecules capable of eliciting very distinctive phenotypic manifestations, particularly focusing our efforts onto defining characteristics contributing differentially to generation of potent inductive cues needed for establishing robust spatial expression profiles characteristic of developing embryos, we chose to examine the relationship linking variations in primary sequence composition of orthologous fly and mouse orthologs of Cubitus interruptus (ci) products respectively implicated genetically upstream and down stream of Patched receptors mediating reception of diffusible shh homolog inducing stimuli. Our choice arose initially motivated partly because although flies lack Ptc related transmembrane component analogous to Ptch1 itself whose inactivation leads to complete abrogation of hh responsiveness in mice 1 1, ptch mutants exhibit relatively mild phenotypes reflecting residual capacity for responding appropriately albeit weakly to ectopic sources of exogenous hh agonist arguing against absolute requirement for PTCH repression of SMO activity in producing strong HH responsive readouts 1 2. Secondly ciRNA interference directed knockdown approaches targeting CiFL mRNA revealed surprisingly weak phenotype rescue implying existence of substantial amount of unaccounted basal activity remaining undetected hitherto presumably attributable mainly to unprocessed precursor form of Ci corresponding to truncated variant missing entire carboxy half comprising several
