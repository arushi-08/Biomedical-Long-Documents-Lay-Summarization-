 users with minimal training requirements while providing comparable results as state-oftheart methods that require extensive manual input or specialized hardware / software solutions. We anticipate its use will be widespread among single molecular biophysics researchers who wish to automate their work without sacrificing speed at all costs by offering fast feedback through intuitive graphical interfaces. ▃ Broader Context • Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy techniques such as super resolution imaging, multicolor labeling schemes, multi color detection systems, etc., allow us now access structural details down into nanometer scales within living cells In addition, new computational tools enable efficient extraction of quantitative parameters describing biomolecular function From large datasets generated using advanced experimental protocols it becomes increasingly difficult however, to extract meaningful biological insights from them. To address some key challenges associated with extracting biologically significant insight from complex image sets, several groups developed algorithms capable of automatically analyzing multiple types of measurements including: intensity distributions; spatial distribution patterns; temporal correlation between different signals A number of approaches exist which can identify molecules via either specific labels or fluorescent dyes However, most existing automatic pipelines rely heavily upon expert knowledge about sample preparation procedures and fluorophore properties For example, one approach uses Gaussian mixture models to classify pixels according to signal intensities but does not consider other important characteristics like dye brightness, photo stability, spectral overlap, etc. This limits automation potential since many factors may affect algorithm performance depending both on instrument setup and operator experience Therefore, there remains considerable interest in developing more general purpose machine intelligence applications able to perform robust statistical analyses directly out of noisy microscopic imagery Data processing has been traditionally performed manually rather than algorithmically so far due largely to lack of availability of suitable programming languages and powerful computing environments. Recently, progress towards fully autonomous platforms was made possible thanks to recent developments in computer science enabling novel architectures designed specifically for bioinformatics tasks. One notable advance involves Deep Learning - Machine Intelligence inspired artificial neural networks trained over vast amounts of labeled text and audio data These Artificial Neural Networks were shown recently to achieve impressive levels of recognition accuracies when applied to various problems ranging from speech synthesis to natural language understanding While previous studies demonstrated successful application of Deep Learning to biomedical domains, they typically required substantial expertise regarding system architecture design and implementation Methods & Results Our goal here is therefore two fold -first, develop a simple yet effective way to apply Deep Learning principles to protein conformational change Analysis Second, demonstrate applicability beyond just conformation changes, namely DNA binding affinity measurement Using our proposed framework called "DeepFRET", we show that even though each individual experiment contains hundreds of thousands of photons per frame, applying conventional histogram binning leads to loss of valuable dynamic information contained therein. As expected, after removing low photon counts from the dataset, no difference could still be observed compared to non-normalized experiments. On contrary, normalizing the original set prior to computation allows capturing subtle differences otherwise masked during traditional normalization processes. Furthermore, comparing Normalized vs. Non Normalized ensembles reveals distinct trends suggesting that detrended ensemble representations capture additional dynamical signatures missed under normal normalizations Conclusions Taken together, given the simplicity of the underlying model implemented herein along with the ability to easily adapt it to any type of biophysical assay, we believe that DeepFRET represents a promising tool for accelerating routine workflows involving Fluorescence Microscopy Imaging Experiments. With further refinement, we envision future implementations would facilitate broad adoption across diverse fields related to biology and medicine. < / FREETEXT > < / INTRO > ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃
