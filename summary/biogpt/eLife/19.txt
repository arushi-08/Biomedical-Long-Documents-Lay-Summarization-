 degradation through both transcriptional induction as well as post translational modification mechanisms involving ubiquitination / proteasomal targeting pathways. These studies also reveal novel functions for NCOA4 during erythropoiesis which may be important not only with respect to its function within specialized cell types but more broadly across tissues where it has been implicated previously based on genetic analyses (Dowdle et al. 2 0 1 4; Mancias & Dice 2 0 1 5). Finally our results suggest potential therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating cellular responses associated with dysregulated iron homeostasis such as cancer or neurodegenerative disease states characterized by abnormal accumulation of toxic metal ions including copper, zinc, manganese etc.. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Autophagy, Ferritin Degradation, Iron Homeostasis, Ubiquitination Pathway, Erythroid Differentiation < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Research organism: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Human < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > The ability to maintain proper nutrient availability while simultaneously limiting exposure to potentially damaging metals represents one fundamental challenge faced throughout evolution from unicellular organisms like yeast to multicellular animals capable of multi lineage development. To meet their nutritional requirements eukaryotic microbes have evolved sophisticated systems designed specifically to sense nutrients available extracellularly and respond appropriately when they become limited either directly due to lack of uptake into specific compartments inside the microbe itself or indirectly because other microbial species compete successfully against them using similar resources present elsewhere in the environment – often referred to collectively here as ‘ feast ’ conditions. Similarly eukaryotes must coordinate growth rates among different tissue lineages so each can produce sufficient numbers of differentiated progeny without depleting stores needed for reproduction once again - otherwise starvation would ensue leading ultimately to death if no new generations were produced over time. While some aspects of sensing extracellular nutrition appear conserved amongst diverse taxa ranging from bacteria to humans there appears little conservation regarding signaling events downstream of detection resulting in appropriate metabolic adaptation despite apparent similarities underlying core biochemical reactions involved in generating energy currencies used ubiquitously throughout all domains of life. For example, although glucose serves primarily as carbon source utilized universally upon depletion, amino acids serve predominantly anabolic purposes serving mainly protein synthesis rather than catabolic utilization even though many fungi utilize sugars exclusively as sole sources of nitrogen regardless whether those same sugar molecules could alternatively fuel catabolism depending solely on environmental circumstances encountered outside versus internally. Thus far most investigations focused largely on understanding central regulatory networks controlling metabolism related gene expression programs whereas relatively few efforts addressed questions about coordination of distinct biological activities occurring concurrently yet independently thereby allowing simultaneous generation of multiple viable offspring following fertilization thus avoiding costly periods requiring cessation of reproductive activity altogether. Such coordinated changes include alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis accompanying increased ATP production necessary for rapid proliferation followed later by activation of gluconeogenesis enabling storage carbohydrate mobilization prior to sporulation initiation observed widely in fungal models undergoing meiosis (reviewed recently in Kressler et al. eLife 7 e6 3 8 9 doi: 1 0. 7.1 0 1 6 / S1 5 3 4 4 [PMC free article] [PubMed] [CrossRef] < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Eukaryotic microorganisms generally possess two major means whereby access to external nutritious substrates becomes restricted relative to internal pools generated de novo e.g. fermentation vs. respiration respectively. One mechanism employed extensively by prokaryotes utilizes transporters located selectively onto outer membranes permitting import of substrate down concentration gradients driven out of cytoplasm provided externally i.e. facilitated diffusion. A second general strategy employs membrane bound enzymes catalyzing irreversible chemical transformations typically catalyzed aerobically utilizing oxygen providing high specificity towards particular compounds being oxidized intracellularly compared to others sharing structural similarity albeit exhibiting lower catalytic efficiency overall. Examples illustrating use of transport proteins includes bacterial siderophore receptors mediating acquisition of ferric siderophores derived endogenously synthesized along biosynthetic pathway initiated off exogenous precursors supplied exogenously termed xenosiderophores. By contrast enzymatic oxidation occurs almost entirely anaerobically since aerobic respiratory chains require O2 supply rendering ferroxidase containing metalloenzyme complexes responsible for oxidizing Fe II rapidly inaccessible unless coupled tightly together forming stable di-nuclear clusters known as dioxygenases whose active sites contain redox centers composed principally of ferrous irons bridged axially by carboxylate groups originating mostly from glutamate residues side chain carboxylates found abundantly distributed around surfaces surrounding binding pockets formed predominately by histidine moieties arising commonly from histidines themselves giving rise to His … Glu bridges frequently seen adjacent to heme prosthetic group cores comprised chiefly of protoporphyrin IX rings fused covalently bonded face wise to vinyl substituents attached to pyrrole ring carbons making up ~ 2Å long hydrophobic channels extending deep enough toward solvent exposed faces facilitating entry of gaseous ligands such as O 2-. As noted above however certain classes of cytochromes c oxidase do exhibit significant reactivity independent of oxygenation state suggesting alternative modes exist wherein electrons entering cytochrome oxidases might flow back reducing protons before reaching final electron acceptors possibly bypassing formation of reactive intermediates normally trapped transiently after initial reduction steps. Another class of oxidoreductases called peroxygenases catalyze oxidative cleavage of organic peroxides yielding water plus alcohol products presumably functioning similarly except employing H2O2 instead of O.
