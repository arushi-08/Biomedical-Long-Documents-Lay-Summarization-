 loop for quick response initiation during plant-microbe interactions. We further showed that H3K4 methyltransferases ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX LIKE 1 0 / KRYPTONITE RELATED 2 6 act as repressors while H3K2 7me2 demethylases JMJ1 4 function redundantly or antagonistically depending on their targets; thus fine tuning dynamic changes between repressive and activating marks around promoters may contribute significantly toward regulating inducible defenses against pathogens such as bacteria and fungi through modulating temporal kinetics rather than absolute levels of transcript accumulation after infection signals arrive from outside cells. Our study provides new insights into mechanisms underlying fast immune signaling via modulation of promoter accessibility mediated by combinatorial interplay among multiple post translational covalent modifiers including H3K4me3 methyltransferase complex COMPASS components ASH2L and WDR5a along with H3K4me2 demethylase JMJD3 acting downstream of jasmonic acid receptor COI1 but upstream of WRKY3 3s which control many important antimicrobial biosynthetic pathways like those involved in production of indole glucosinolates, phenylpropanoids etc.. This work also highlights an emerging theme where crosstalk amongst different types of regulatory elements contributes towards shaping specific patterns of transcriptome output under various developmental contexts –. The identification here of distinct modes operating within small groups of functionally related loci suggests potential strategies using epigenome editing tools based on CRISPR technology could help dissect molecular basis behind disease resistance phenotypes observed across species when plants encounter diverse microbial challenges [5 9]. Further studies will reveal whether similar principles operate beyond phytohormone regulated processes governing immunity since they share common features shared by other stress responsive systems: e.g. salicylic acid- dependent systemic acquired resistance- associated protein kinase NPR1 acts similarly to MYC2 mediating jasmonate response.It would therefore not only enhance our understanding about fundamental aspects underpinning host specificity vs. non pathogenicity traits exhibited by microbes attacking hosts ranging over monocots & dicots. Finally it should prove interesting if future efforts directed specifically at dissecting spatiotemporal organization of epigenomes might uncover novel layers contributing directly to development programs involving cell fate decisions leading ultimately to specialized cellular functions required for adaptation to ever evolving environments. Such knowledge has implications both fundamentally regarding evolutionary biology questions concerning origins of multicellularity itself and more broadly considering possible applications exploiting genome engineering technologies aimed at manipulating heritable phenotypic variation arising out of differential deployment of genetic information encoded epigenetically throughout genomes. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All experiments were performed according to standard protocols described previously except details below. For ChIP assays seedlings grown vertically without sucrose supplementation was used unless otherwise stated. Seedlings treated either mock inoculated or infected with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3 0 0D2 8E strain expressing AvrRpt2 effector molecule were harvested approximately 8h later following inoculation. Samples collected before treatment served as controls. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay followed by quantitative PCR analysis was carried out essentially as reported earlier [6 0]. Briefly nuclei isolated from formaldehyde cross linked tissue samples fixed immediately prior harvesting were sonicated until DNA fragments ranged ~ 5kb long then immunoprecipitated overnight respectively first with anti H3K4me1 antibody recognizing monomethylated K4 residue present predominantly near TSS regions of active genes and second with antibodies raised against H3K9K1 4Ac residues representing acetylated forms enriched primarily inside coding region of actively transcribed genes. After reversal of crosslinks enrichment values obtained relative abundance value calculated taking input sample serving as reference set normalized accordingly.
