 flies can use taste perception during pathogen detection by detecting microbial toxins with their innate immunity machinery through TRP ion channels.Significance Statement Innate defense systems rely on rapid recognition of invading microbes via pattern recognition proteins such as Toll or Nod like Receptors; however, little information exists about other potential means used by organisms when they encounter infectious agents outside specialized organs / tissues. In particular, insects have evolved an array of behavioral strategies including aversion behaviors against noxious stimuli associated with infections. Using genetic tools available only recently in fruit fly models, here we report evidence suggesting that olfactory gustation plays key roles not just in host location after ingestion of pathogenic bacteria, but also directly sensing microbe components without relying solely on olfaction per se. This work provides new insights into insect behavior towards potentially harmful microorganisms using both chemical senses simultaneously: smell and tast.Graphical Abstract ᅟ. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
