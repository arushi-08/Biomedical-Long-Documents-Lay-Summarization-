 formation / FREETEXT > ▃ Results & Discussion ▃ To understand whether there exists any other proteins interacting directly or indirectly via adaptor molecules for Myo3b Tail Homology Domain II region (MyTH4 + FERM; residues 5 6 0 - 8 9 7) which has been shown previously by us as well as others to interact tightly with several known myosin adaptors including espin isoforms 2 and 3a In addition to identifying two potential interaction sites on MyTH4 domain using pull down assays followed up mass spectrometry analysis, our crystal structure reveals another novel site located at C terminal part of MyTH domain where one helix from each molecule forms antiparallel coiled coil interactions forming dimer interface between them. This dimerization mode was confirmed both biochemically and structurally based upon analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showing molecular weight consistent with dimeric state of purified recombinant MyTH4FERMI construct used here (Supplementary Fig S1 A -B). Our structural data revealed additional features such as presence of conserved positively charged surface patch near N terminus of MyTH4 suggesting possible role played by electrostatic forces during target recognition process (Figs Figs1 1C- -D 1D).D 1E]. Interestingly, sequence alignment showed high degree conservation among different species within putative targets identified above indicating functional importance across various organisms [see below section Myosin V binds to ESPN1 Repeats Using Two Distinct Binding Sites ”]. These results suggest existence of multiple distinct modes of targeting specific cargoes onto motor domains containing unconventional myosins like Myo3a.It should be noted though that although all three regions have similar overall charge distribution pattern they do show some differences especially around predicted helical segments involved in mediating homodimerization of MyTH4 domain (Fig 1F). For example while helices α1 '-2 "contain mostly negatively charges amino acids except few positive ones whereas α2" -3 "shows more number of basic than acidic resides along entire length of Helix α3". Furthermore, comparison of secondary chemical shifts values calculated over backbone amide resonances obtained after assigning NMR spectra of free versus bound form indicates significant changes mainly localized close vicinity of homodimer interfaces formed due to heterodimerization of MyTH4 domain involving either MyTH1 * -1 "or MyTH2 * -4" motifs respectively (Supplementary Table S2). Taken altogether, despite having very low primary sequence identity amongst members belonging to same subfamily, common themes emerge when comparing 3D folds adopted by individual family member's globular head modules consisting primarily of α helixes connected by loops interspersed with short β strands arranged into characteristic Rossmann fold topology observed earlier in many nucleotide dependent enzymes e.g. kinases etc. However unlike typical kinase heads whose active centers reside deep inside catalytic cleft surrounded by large hydrophobic pockets lined predominantly by aromatic side chains, atypical motors possess smaller ATP hydrolyzing pocket buried under relatively featureless surfaces composed largely of polar groups thus making docking orientation towards substrates difficult without major conformational rearrangements taking place. As mentioned before, most non conventional kinesins use microtubule tracks rather then filamentous actins as track thereby requiring tight regulation mechanisms keeping off unwanted movement toward wrong destinations. One way would involve direct competition against microtubules because kinesin heavy chain possesses long unstructured neck linker segment connecting core ATPase module to cargo attachment point called “stalk". Another possibility could include steric hindrance caused if cargos bind behind the central axis of Kinesin-MT complexes preventing proper association of MTs with Kinesins leading ultimately resulting in dissociation of the latter once transport direction reverses. Alternatively, indirect regulatory pathways might exist whereby certain effectors act upstream of classical cytoskeletal elements causing modulation of activities associated with those systems allowing fine tuning control of intracellular movements. Such examples includes phosphorylation events occurring downstream of Rho GTPases signaling cascades controlling localization patterns of MAPs and hence affecting stability properties of microtubular network. Although no experimental evidences were available so far regarding involvement of post translational modifications in modulating function of myosinVs prior to identification of Myo5a: Rab1 1a complex reported recently by us Structural studies carried out till date indicate similarity between canonical F-Actin binding CH Domains present in tandem array in skeletal muscle type alpha actinin and spectrin superfamily proteins responsible for crosslinking adjacent filaments. While calponin homology (CH1) alone does exhibit weak affinity for G-Filamentous Actins (~ μM range), combination of CH2 and CH3 subdomains display much higher affinities ranging anywhere from nM to pM depending upon nature of linkers joining respective pairs of CH domains.Thus, given similarities shared between actinins and spectrins--key components of microfilament bundles found throughout eukaryotic cell cytoskeleton--spectraplaks may employ analogous strategies employing modular arrangements comprising tandemly arrayed CH domains linked to variable numbers of EF hand Ca 2 + -binding motifs. fimbrin belongs to closely related group sharing highest level of architectural resemblance with dystrophin rod unit possessing four consecutive CH domains flanked by proline rich stretches separated by flexible hinges giving rise to elongated shape resembling double headed architecture seen commonly in intermediate filaments- An interesting feature exhibited by Spectrin Family Proteins involves ability to self associate creating linear arrays of parallel dimers bridged laterally by single stranded protofibrils made up entirely of repeating αβ heterodimers folded similarly toαβα- arrangement described previously.The first step taken herein consisted of determining
