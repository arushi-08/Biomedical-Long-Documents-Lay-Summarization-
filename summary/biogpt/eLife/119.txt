 transcription factor activity on endogenous genes upon light stimulation without any detectable side effects or toxicity during prolonged illumination periods up to 2 4 h. Our results demonstrate that our improved magnetism module is suitable not only for optogenetic applications but also potentially useful when combined together with other photosensitive systems such as cryptochromes / photolyases family members [1 0 – 3 5] since they can heterodimerize under blue LED irradiation even if their respective partner does it homodimerize independently after red laser exposure. In addition, because both Magnet variants share similar spectral properties allowing multiplexing approaches based either on different wavelengths used simultaneously or spectrally shifted versions generated through mutagenesis studies will likely improve future experimental designs involving multiple orthogonal pairs within one experiment setting. Finally, although further optimization may still need improvement regarding expression levels required for some experiments due to differences between constructs encoding each component individually; however, given its simplicity and robustness, eMags represents another valuable tool available now to study cellular biology where rapid reversible recruitment events have been shown essential including signaling pathways involved in development regulation like Wnt pathway, apoptosis induction via caspase cascade modulation, nuclear envelope reassembly following mitosis exit, DNA damage response mechanisms mediated by ATM kinase etc … The modular design presented here allows easy exchange among existing tools providing new opportunities especially those related to optogenetics application while maintaining compatibility with current standard molecular cloning techniques already established worldwide. Therefore, combining several distinct Photoswitches could help increase versatility and expand applicability range beyond what has currently limited most efforts towards developing novel technologies exploiting combinations of two or more opsins. This approach would allow researchers access to additional functionalities previously unavailable thanks to restrictions imposed by specific requirements set forth by individual projects thus expanding possibilities offered today by modern synthetic biologists working toward creating custom designer organisms capable of sensing environmental changes thereby adapting accordingly. For example, recent work showed successful adaptation of bacteria expressing OptoXR gene circuit designed around Cryptogam receptors to detect UV radiation avoiding harmful effect associated with long term continuous exposures to visible lights commonly found throughout nature. Similarly, use of Magnetosomes containing Phytochrome B receptor was recently demonstrated successfully applied to monitor magnetic fields variations induced by human movement inside buildings making possible monitoring purposes outside laboratory settings. Moreover, combination of various Light- Inducible Dimerizers described above along with newly developed ones targeting alternative intracellular compartments should facilitate exploration of many unexplored areas ranging from basic science discoveries about fundamental aspects underlying diverse physiological functions down to clinical translation perspectives opening exciting avenues for personalized medicine developments. Overall, despite being less versatile than conventional genetic methods relying exclusively on overexpression strategies, CRISPR technology offers unique advantages over previous alternatives offering higher specificity and efficiency coupled with ease of implementation across all species tested so far. Thus, integration of Magnetics system reported herein alongside CRISPRs promises great potential benefits compared to traditional genetics toolbox particularly considering emerging genome editing capabilities achieved nowadays facilitating generation of sophisticated animal models mimicking disease states unattainable otherwise. Furthermore, besides generating genetically encoded sensors able to report real time dynamics of biochemical reactions occurring locally in living cells, Magnetization devices offer promising prospects for remote actuation schemes aiming at controlling tissue growth patterns ex vivo or inducing desired behaviors remotely e.g. locomotion movements in animals implanted with miniaturized magnets attached onto body parts. These features make Magnetic Devices attractive candidates for regenerative therapies aimed at restoring lost function caused by injury or degenerative diseases affecting nervous tissues whose repair capacity remains extremely poor owing mainly to lack of appropriate therapeutic agents acting specifically against damaged neurons. Altogether, the present manuscript describes important advances made concerning Magnetostimulation platform paving way forward innovative concepts addressing unmet needs arising out of precision neuroscience investigations and medical treatments alike. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction: ▃ Precision Medicine aims at tailoring treatment plans according to patients' characteristics rather then treating every patient uniformly. To achieve this goal, scientists must develop advanced diagnostic procedures permitting early detection of pathological conditions before irreversible damages occur. At least three major challenges remain unsolved hindering progress in achieving effective diagnosis and therapy protocols: i) heterogeneity inherent to complex disorders ii) inability to predict accurately who might benefit from particular interventions iii) insufficient knowledge surrounding pathophysiology leading often times poorly understood mechanistic details precluding rational drug discovery process. As part of ongoing effort directed towards overcoming obstacles outlined earlier, there exists growing interest in exploring artificial intelligence algorithms inspired by natural evolution principles to aid clinicians in decision support tasks improving accuracy rates of diagnoses and predicting outcomes. A number of computational methodologies were proposed attempting to address problems mentioned above.One strategy consists in designing smart implants composed of biocompatible materials encapsulating bioactive molecules delivering drugs selectively targeted to diseased sites. Another option relies on implantable electronic stimulators incorporating electrodes integrated directly beneath skin surface stimulating nerve fibers innervating target organs. Although highly desirable solutions, drawbacks include invasiveness resulting mostly from surgical intervention itself and difficulty translating device functionality once placed subcutaneously into humans. An appealing solution lies in harnessing external stimuli instead of internal signals provided naturally by neural networks themselves. External inputs consist essentially of electromagnetic waves operating near resonant frequencies corresponding typically to absorption bands characteristic of certain biomaterials embedded therein. Such resonance phenomena arise primarily from dielectric losses originating principally from electron transitions taking
