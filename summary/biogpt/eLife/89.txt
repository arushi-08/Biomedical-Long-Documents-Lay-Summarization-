 splicing during early stages when only one or two alternative transcripts can be generated from each gene locus before committing them for inclusion into mature mRNAs (Figure 1). Our results suggest that cooperative binding between different components within multi-component protein assemblies may represent general principles underlying efficient co-transcriptional RNA processing events such as those required at transcription termination [2 – 4]. These insights could help guide future studies on other aspects of eukaryotic genome expression including regulation through chromatin structure and epigenetic modifications; coupling among steps along pathways involving DNA replication, repair, recombination etc ….. In addition our approach provides new tools enabling quantitative analysis of complex molecular machines involved in cellular functions ranging from signal transduction cascades down to genetic information transfer via translation machinery up until cell division... All told: A novel combination of fluorescence microscopy techniques applied here has revealed unexpected mechanistic details about key biological process occurring inside living cells....
