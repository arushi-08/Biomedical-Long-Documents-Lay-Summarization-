 with stimulus onset time: early after delivery there was increased coupling within sensory regions but decreased long range connections from posterior parietal cortices into frontal cortical fields that control movement execution. Later during ongoing trials when animals performed movements they showed reduced short distance communication among sensorimotor structures as well as enhanced interareal interactions at longer distances through fronto - temporal pathways involved in cognitive processing. Our results suggest dynamic modulation by brain stimulation can lead not only to enhancement of specific circuit function locally but also alter global patterns of activity throughout distributed neuronal ensembles engaged for behavior. The observed pattern suggests potential mechanisms underlying therapeutic benefits associated with DBS treatment such as improved behavioral performance following chronic therapy despite no direct effect being seen directly beneath stimulating contacts. This work provides evidence supporting theoretical models suggesting altered information flow may underlie clinical improvements resulting from neuromodulation therapies including deep brain stimulation.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTUnderstanding how different forms of neurostimulation modulate human cognition is critical if we wish to optimize their use clinically. Here we show using high density electrophysiology over multiple days that electrical microstimulations delivered via implanted microelectrodes alters both fine structure synaptic transmission along individual axons projecting onto single cells and larger scales coordination of population firing rates around each electrode site. Stimulation leads initially to strengthening intra regional circuitry while later enhancing inter region communications which could be related either to more efficient recruitment of task appropriate nodes leading ultimately to better learning / memory consolidation processes or alternatively reflecting compensatory reorganization due to disrupted input arising elsewhere in the system. Overall our data support theories proposing plasticity driven reconfiguration underlies beneficial outcomes achieved under neuromodulatory treatments like Deep Brain Stimulations. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
