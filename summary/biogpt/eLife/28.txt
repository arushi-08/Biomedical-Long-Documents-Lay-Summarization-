 modulates information flow between nodes within an alpha band frequency domain while simultaneously enhancing communication across gamma bands over time scales ranging from seconds up to1 0 minutes after stimulus onset. These observations suggest novel mechanisms through which brain oscillations shape cognition: they can be used not only at short timescales but also remotely via external modulation techniques like tDCS even several hours later. ▃ ▃ ▃ SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT ▃ The human cortex exhibits spontaneous fluctuations in neuronal excitability known collectively as "resting states" or ongoing low amplitude neural rhythms. We show here using noninvasive electrical neuromodulation combined with simultaneous EEG / MEG recordings that endogenous changes in cortical oscillation frequencies affect both local spiking rates and global patterns of interregional synchrony associated with higher order mental function including attention control tasks involving visual perception and language comprehension. Our study provides direct experimental support linking specific aspects of intrinsic rhythmic networks involved in executive functioning directly to their dynamic interplay among multiple regions distributed throughout frontal cortices and posterior temporal areas. This work demonstrates new ways forward toward understanding complex relationships underlying normal neurocognitive development and disease pathophysiology based upon knowledge about individual differences in neurophysiology rather than focusing solely on group averages derived from neuroimaging studies alone. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
