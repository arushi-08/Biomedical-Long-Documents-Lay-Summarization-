These phenomena have long puzzled scientists because they cannot easily explain why normal sensation would not disappear after inflammation subsides but instead persist indefinitely despite resolution of all other signs of disease progression [e.g., swelling].1 Pain hypersensitivity develops when nociceptors become sensitized during inflammation.2 In addition to sensitization mechanisms involving primary afferent fibers themselves there appears to exist some forms where secondary processes contribute significantly toward nociceptor sensitization--one example being disinhibition via loss of inhibitory interactions.3 Disinhibited states arise either centrally resulting from changes occurring postsynaptically along second order neuron pathways projecting onto higher centers like thalamus or peripherally arising from alterations affecting synaptic inputs impinging upon first order neurons.4 For instance, studies using animal models indicate that descending serotonergic projections originating primarily from raphe magnus modulate responses evoked by noxious stimuli acting presynaptically across multiple synapses throughout ascending pathways.5 A recent report suggests involvement of serotonin receptors located exclusively outside presynaptic terminals suggesting possible postsynaptic actions underlying disinhibition.6 Another mechanism involves direct modulation exerted over C fiber terminals.7At present we do know very little about what drives hyperexcitability observed among small diameter unmyelinated afferents innervating skin tissues nor does our knowledge allow prediction whether similar types of plasticity will operate similarly between different classes of mechanosensory afferents.2 Thus far most attention given towards understanding neural control of acute versus prolonged mechanical stimulation induced hypersensitivities focuses almost entirely on large caliber myelinated Aβ mechanoreceptive fibres.8 However, emerging evidence indicates functional heterogeneity exists even amongst low threshold mechanosensitive cutaneous axons based largely on their conduction velocity distributio.9 Therefore future efforts should focus more closely on defining specific roles played by distinct populations of somatosensory cells involved in mediating various aspects related to tactile sensations ranging from innocuous touch detection down to painful stimuli.1 0 It remains unclear if common cellular substrates underlie development of abnormal excitability seen commonly accompanying many pathologies linked to altered somatosensation especially those characterized by sustained pain.3 One possibility could include dysregulation of intrinsic membrane properties coupled with impaired homeostatic regulation operating normally responsible for maintaining stable resting potentials essential for proper functioning of excitable cells.1 1 Indeed several ion channels expressed abundantly in mammalian nervous system play key role regulating cell excitability.1 2 Among them potassium channel subunits Kv7. 2 and Kv1 1.X were shown recently to regulate firing patterns generated intrinsically in DRG nodose ganglion neurons controlling thermal sensing behaviors1 3 while Nav1. 9,another voltage gated sodium channel1 4plays major part modulating action potential generation triggered downstream intracellular signaling.7 Recent reports highlight importance of hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotidegated cation currents HCN contributing importantly to setting up appropriate electrical balance required for maintenance of physiological functionalities.1 5Further investigation aimed specifically addressing molecular underpinnings governing aberrant excitation might help identify novel targets amenable to therapeutic intervention against intractable pains often encountered clinically today. Here we address contribution made by local circuit elements expressing Ca 2 + -binding proteins belonging to EF hand family members known collectively as calmodulins together referred here simply as “Calmodulin ” hereafter.4 Although calmodulin itself lacks enzymatic function per se its ability to bind free cytoplasmic Ca2 + ions allows rapid transduction events initiated locally near active zones thereby enabling fast signal propagation away from release sites.1 6 Such localized increases in cytosolic concentration trigger conformational change allowing interaction with target molecules thus initiating diverse biological responses.1 7 Interestingly CaM's closest structural homolog troponin C binds only four rather than two bound calcium1 8 whereas others exhibit varying degrees of cooperativity depending on nature of ligand bin
