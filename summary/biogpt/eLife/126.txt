 homeostatic mechanisms at multiple levels: altering sensory input through alterations in excitatory synapse number; modulating inhibitory tone via regulation of GABA release probability from presynaptic terminals onto postsynaptic cells; as well as controlling dendritic spine density on cortical principal neuron dendrites. These results suggest novel roles for Rem2 signaling pathways within circuits involved in learning and memory processes such as those underlying cognitive flexibility or working memory.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe small GTP binding protein Rem2 has been implicated previously in axon guidance (Ghiretti et al., 1 9 8 6) but its precise functions remain poorly understood. In particular, it was unknown whether Rem2 regulates specific aspects of brain development including synaptogenesis between afferent axons innervating target regions where they form synapses. Using genetic approaches combined with electrophysiological analyses, here we show that loss of expression of the gene encoding mouse Rem2 leads not only to defects in axonal targeting patterns across several different CNS structures, but also affects basic physiological parameters associated with membrane potential dynamics which ultimately impact network behavior throughout developing brains. Our study provides new insights regarding the functional significance of Rem2 proteins beyond their known involvement in developmental patterning events involving neurite outgrowth control. Moreover, given recent evidence implicating mutations in human REM2 genes linked directly to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized primarily by intellectual disability, further studies will be required to determine if aberrant Rem2 pathway activation contributes causally toward disease pathogenesis. GLIA COMMUNICATION STATEMENT This article describes experiments designed to explore possible links among three major classes of molecules thought to play central regulatory roles in nervous system wiring decisions over time periods ranging up to two decades long after initial formation of connections have occurred. Specifically, using behavioral assays coupled with detailed anatomical analysis followed by targeted electrophysiology measurements performed ex utero before animals reach adulthood, we examined effects resulting when one member each of four distinct families were deleted individually either singly or simultaneously. Results indicate significant deficits in all cases suggesting common mechanistic underpinnings linking them mechanistically even though some phenotypes appeared more severe than others depending upon deletion type used. Together, these observations support previous work showing strong correlations amongst members belonging to any single family studied thus far indicating shared fundamental principles governing many forms of biological organization operating concurrently rather than sequentially along temporal axes following birth. Thus, while there may exist additional factors contributing towards unique features observed under certain conditions, overall outcomes point strongly forward towards overlapping yet highly specialized modes of action employed by various components comprising complex networks supporting higher order behaviors. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
