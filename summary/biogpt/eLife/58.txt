 in β cell function that is lost when either residue becomes unpaired during oxidative protein misfolding stress associated with obesity / T2D [1 3 •]. The finding suggests an unexpected role for cysteines within nascent polypeptide chains as determinants not only of their own structure but also those they partner up: by forming mixed disulfides between two polypeptides containing different thiols — e.g., through oxidation reactions catalyzed directly by Ero1α itself - it may be possible to coordinate assembly pathways among multiple proteins involved in secretory pathway proteostasis. Disulfide bond isomerization can occur spontaneously without assistance from enzymes like PDI family members, which have been thought important primarily because of kinetic considerations rather than direct catalytic activity per se. This study provides evidence suggesting that some oxidoreductases might play roles beyond catalysis under conditions where substrate concentrations exceed enzyme affinities. It will now become interesting whether other components besides Ero1a contribute significantly toward shaping cellular redox networks involving specific substrates via mechanisms similar to what we propose here for ERp4 4 action on proinsulin trafficking. Finally, although our studies focus specifically upon ER luminal events related to biosynthesis of mature hormone products, there has long been interest elsewhere about potential functions outside the lumen, particularly regarding secreted forms of both prohormones themselves and PDIs themselves. We speculate therefore that future work could explore additional aspects relating to extracellular regulation mediated by interactions between soluble factors released into conditioned media versus membrane bound receptors expressed extracellularly. Such questions would likely benefit greatly if considered alongside efforts focused initially around understanding intracellular processes governing synthesis and secretion of peptide signaling ligands acting locally across plasma membranes. For example, recent reports suggest that activation of G Protein Coupled Receptors leads to rapid changes in local concentration gradients of small molecule agonists near cognate GPCRs due largely to diffusion barriers imposed by cytoskeletal elements present along endocytic compartments en route towards lysosomes. Thus far however, little attention was paid systematically to identifying molecular players mediating transport steps preceding lysosomal degradation once internalized ligand traversed endosomal systems prior to delivery back out again onto target cells ’ surface following agonist removal. Our results raise intriguing possibilities concerning contributions made by oxidoreductase activities operating downstream of GPCR stimulation given known effects exerted over time scales ranging several minutes down wards after initial exposure to activating agents. Moreover, since many growth factor signals act intracellularly before being degraded proteolytically inside endosomes, consideration should perhaps extend even farther upstream considering potentially significant involvement played by post translational modifications carried out exclusively by resident cytosolic enzymes distinct from classical signal transduction kinases active throughout much longer periods immediately surrounding hormonal challenge. Indeed, while most current thinking focuses almost entirely upon reversible phosphorylation occurring rapidly enough so as to serve acute regulatory purposes, new insights arising from ongoing investigations focusing increasingly upon posttranslational modification patterns acquired early vs. late stages of biosynthetic processing offer exciting opportunities for revisiting old paradigms pertaining to control of endocrine system development and physiology. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > A central tenet underlying all models proposed thus far relates to dynamic relationships established amongst key constituents comprising homeostatic circuits controlling production rates of bioactive peptides produced de novo each day. These include transcription regulators whose expression levels dictate overall output capacity based simply upon gene dosage alone whereas others must respond dynamically according to changing demands placed upon them. One striking feature emerging from analysis described above concerns identification of genes encoding putative cargo recognition machinery required selectively for export of newly synthesized pro-opiomelanocortin precursors destined ultimately for storage granules located principally just beneath trans Golgi cisternae compared against ones directing packaging away from cis side faces of stacked cisternal stacks characteristic of rough endoplamic reticula found ubiquitously distributed throughout eukaryotic organisms. As noted earlier, COPII vesicles formed using Sec2 3a subunits appear capable of accommodating cargoes larger then ~ 2 5 nm diameter yet smaller cargos seem unable to fit readily into conventional “coated ” vesicle structures observed microscopically. While speculative, this observation raises the possibility that specialized subsets of coat assemblies exist dedicated solely to exporting large dense core granule contents relative to relatively less complex carriers responsible for bulk flow of material exiting RER entrances. Alternatively, certain types of transmembrane adaptors implicated previously in selective sorting decisions affecting exit sites occupied by various classes of integral membrane glycoproteins residing wholly or partially confined topologically below lumenal surfaces of maturing organelles might instead operate preferentially on cytoplasmic domains exposed transiently behind budding buds generated off translocon pores embedded deep within lipid bilayers lining developing tubular connections connecting adjacent segments of immature organelle lumens. Further complicating matters somewhat, numerous examples already document instances wherein seemingly unrelated families of oligomeric transporters exhibit overlapping specificities despite sharing no obvious sequence homology nor any recognizable common domain architecture aside from presence of hydrophobic regions predicted to form α helical bundles serving as docking platforms recognizing short linear motifs conforming minimally defined consensus sequences recognized by adaptor binding partners. Given growing appreciation emphasizing importance of spatial organization principles underpinning biogenesis of diverse macromolecular entities targeted appropriately to subcellular destinations, especially highly polarized epithelial tissues featuring apical vs basolateral poles harboring functionally discrete sets of organellar subcompartment residents displaying unique compositions reflecting distinctive requirements dictated by physiological needs posed daily by organismal life cycles, it seems reasonable to predict existence of novel modes whereby combinatorial actions orchestrated together by assorted combinations of structurally divergent multi subunit adapter modules help define specificity profiles guiding selection outcomes dict
