 histone modifications at promoters or enhancers as well as DNA methylation status within CpG islands near TSSs / 5 '-ends of coding regions. We also show evidence for widespread epigenetic instability during cellular reprogramming into induced pluripotency stem cells which may be related to incomplete erasure of parental imprints on imprinted loci. These data highlight potential mechanisms underlying transcriptional heterogeneity observed between individual mammalian somatic nuclei after nuclear transfer procedures used routinely today for therapeutic cloning applications [corrected].Significance Statement Monoallelically expressing X chromosome inactivation master regulator Xist has recently emerged from studies using single nucleus RNA sequencing techniques but there remains limited understanding regarding regulatory elements controlling other examples of epigenetically variable autosomes such as those encoding many disease susceptibility factors. Here, through analysis of genome wide datasets generated via ChIP seq experiments coupled with computational approaches designed around our previously reported "enhancer code" method, we identify novel signatures characteristic of transcriptionally heterogeneous genomic domains containing either ubiquitous housekeeping functions or lineage restricted differentiation programs respectively. This work provides important insights towards elucidating possible causes behind stochastic variability seen amongst different individuals when studying normal development processes like aging where some tissues appear more susceptible than others due to their inherent genetic makeup. Furthermore, since most cancer genomes exhibit extensive alterations compared to healthy counterparts, identification of similar patterns could help explain why certain cancers tend not only to occur early in life yet remain relatively rare throughout adulthood while another subset appears late onset despite being genetically identical. Finally, given recent advances made toward generating patient derived iPSCs without any risk involving immune rejection reactions following transplantation therapy based upon matching donor's own germ line versus recipient ’ s somatic epigenome information, further investigation will likely lead us closer to realizing personalized medicine strategies utilizing iPSC technology combined with advanced bioinformatics tools developed here. All together, they would allow researchers to better understand both physiological variation caused solely by genetics vs. environmental influences vs pathological changes resulting directly from aberrant epigenomic states leading ultimately to various disorders ranging from neurological conditions affecting memory formation & learning capabilities to metabolic syndromes characterized primarily by obesity along side cardiovascular ailments causing high morbidity rates worldwide. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
