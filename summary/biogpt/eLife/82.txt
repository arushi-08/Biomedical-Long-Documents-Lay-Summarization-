 at increasing blood flow during exercise by optimizing hemoglobin function through changing its conformation rather than altering ligand affinities or cooperativities as previously suggested. This new insight into adaptive mechanisms provides an important framework from which future studies can investigate other proteins with similar functions across species using comparative approaches such as phylogenetics combined with structural biology techniques. The results also have implications beyond biomedical sciences because they may help explain why some mutations cause disease while others do not. For example, our finding suggests one possible explanation for human sickle cell anemia where certain amino acid substitutions reduce but don't abolish cooperative interactions among subunits without affecting overall structure stability thereby causing pathology despite being located far away from any known functional sites within individual subunit interfaces. In contrast, many pathological variants associated with diseases like diabetes mellitus type 2 increase either intrinsic flexibility / disorder propensity leading to aggregation prone conformations [3 1 – 4 0] or alter quaternary structures resulting in loss of allostery required for proper functioning thus impairing glucose metabolism even though none is directly involved in regulating enzyme activity per se. Thus, understanding evolution via studying natural variation will be critical when considering drug design strategies targeting specific residues responsible for modulating biological processes including those implicated in various pathologies since it could lead us toward better therapeutic interventions based upon knowledge about genetic variations linked to different phenotypes instead of focusing solely on identifying deleterious ones. Finally, given recent advances made towards developing synthetic hemoglobins designed specifically tailored to improve O2 transport capacity under hypoxic conditions, further investigation regarding their potential use against hypoxia induced disorders would seem warranted especially if engineered versions were shown capable of mimicking native properties more closely resembling wild types due to limited information available concerning naturally occurring mutants exhibiting altered functionality compared to WT counterparts. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Oxygen Binding Curve, Hemoglobin Cooperativity, Molecular Adaptation, Protein Structure Evolution, Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction, Phylogenetic Analysis < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > A major goal of modern genetics has been elucidating patterns governing sequence divergence over time allowing researchers to infer ancestral sequences representing key points throughout phylogenetic history before speciation events occurred. These reconstructed ancestors represent useful tools enabling investigators to examine whether particular phenotypic traits observed today result primarily from selection pressures acting early after gene duplication followed later by mutation accumulation versus having evolved independently multiple times following independent duplications prior to diversification. Such analyses allow inferences pertaining to what selective forces acted initially post genome doubling whereas subsequent mutational steps contribute little additional constraint once duplicated genes diverge sufficiently enough so that no longer subject them to purifying selections operating simultaneously; i.e. there exists sufficient redundancy present amongst duplicate copies permitting retention regardless of positive Darwinian selection pressure exerted elsewhere. As illustrated here involving two paralogous vertebrate globin chains differing greatly in terms of oxygenation characteristics yet sharing high levels of similarity, analysis of extant orthologs together with reconstructions inferred earlier in phylogeny permits inference relating biochemical differences seen currently arising late vs. very recently postparalogy emergence back up onto much older periods predating separation of paralogs. By comparing predicted physicochemical features obtained computationally modeling each chain's 3D crystal coordinates generated experimentally, insights gained herein should aid efforts aimed at designing artificial globins targeted particularly well suited for improving performance under low PO2 environments characteristic of deep sea habitats encountered millions years ago perhaps predating the origin of tetrapods themselves ~ 5 8 6 million year old estimated around 7 9 0Ma. Moreover, although most investigations examining effects of single point missense polymorphisms involve examination of consequences stemming exclusively from alterations in primary polypeptide backbone folding pattern caused largely by substitution of hydrophobic side groups typically buried inside core regions often accompanied by concomitant shifts in secondary elements positioning relatively close to tertiary folds then surface exposed loops connecting β strands making contact forming surfaces etc.. However, several examples exist wherein subtle modifications influencing local electrostatic potentials near active site pockets appear able to exert significant influence on catalytic rates suggesting caution must accompany interpretation of data gathered merely relying on comparisons performed assuming identical spatial arrangements of α helices surrounding heme pocket cavities irrespective of actual three dimensional fold adopted e.g. see Ref.}. Indeed, evidence presented above indicates considerable plasticity inherent in nature whereby minor perturbations introduced remotely outside putative substrate access channels might significantly impact enzymatic efficiency presumably reflecting constraints imposed by need to maintain optimal interaction networks necessary for maintaining global architecture essential for catalysis coupled with ability to accommodate slight rearrangements needed to optimize accommodation of substrates bound therein. Therefore, careful consideration needs to taken whenever interpreting experimental observations acquired utilizing artificially created mutant forms bearing non conservative replacements distant from functionally crucial areas unless otherwise indicated. Furthermore, comparison of orthologous pairs possessing highly conserved residue identities interspersed sporadically distributed throughout entire polypeptides likely reflects greater tolerance exhibited by organisms living deeper below water depths experiencing lower atmospheric partial pressures of dissolved gases characterized by higher saturation states favoring increased solubility facilitating diffusion out of cells potentially enhancing survival chances afforded by enhanced respiratory capacities conferred by modified kinetic constants discussed herein.The fact that humans possess four alpha globin loci encoding six homologous isoforms makes identification of true “null ” alleles difficult except possibly requiring whole exome sequencing approach akin to work done analyzing mouse Hbb locus containing five unlinked
