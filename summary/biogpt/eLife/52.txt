 function can be separated from its role during early stages of infection thread formation by genetic means. Our results suggest an evolutionary scenario where ancestral plant receptors evolved into dual specificity towards bacterial ligands at one time point while maintaining their ability to interact functionally also later on through co-evolution within host cells. This may explain why plants such as legumes which form AMs share common components involved in signal transduction pathways used across different types of endosymbioses including those formed via intracellular bacteria residing inside eukaryotic hosts. ▃ ▃ ▃ DATABASE URL ▃ http: / / dx.doi.org / 1 0. 5 4 8 6 / dryad.1k2hw. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
