 (i.e., "try again!) as strategies when faced with choice problems; they also showed comparable sensitivity to reward magnitude or probability distributions over time within each laboratory environment. These data demonstrate reproducibility between independent groups using identical protocols at two levels: learning rate during initial exposure to tasks is highly consistent among labs while performance after extensive practice remains stable despite variability in individual animals' rates of acquisition. This work provides an important step toward establishing standards by which behavioral experiments should report their methods so researchers may compare them directly without bias from experimenter subjectivity. The open access nature of our dataset allows others interested in replicating studies could use it freely via http / / www.mousebehavior.org / publications / animal% 2 0decisions  data.html. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
