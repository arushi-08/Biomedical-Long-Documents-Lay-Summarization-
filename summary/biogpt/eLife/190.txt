 roles outside development or immunity (Figure 2).We have recently shown using conditional gene targeting approaches that both TRAF1 and TRAF3 play important regulatory roles within B lymphocytes [4 0 – 5 3]; however their expression patterns differ from those observed for other TRAF family members such as TRAF6 which suggests they may be more specialised than previously thought. In addition we found evidence suggesting distinct functional properties between different isoforms of each protein: while full length isoform A appears dispensable whereas truncated form C can compensate loss of all forms of TRAF3 it does so only partially when expressed at normal levels indicating some degree of specificity exists among them. The relative importance of individual splice variants remains unclear although recent studies suggest there could also exist differences with respect to subcellular localisation / substrate binding preferences amongst various spliced versions of either molecule. For example alternative splicing events involving exon skipping were identified during analysis of human T lymphocyte populations where one variant lacking exons 6 & 7 appeared preferentially upregulated following activation compared to wild type controls thus potentially providing another mechanism through which differential usage of alternatively spliced transcripts encoding functionally diverse proteins occurs under physiological conditions. Further work will need to address whether similar mechanisms operate on genes involved in autoimmune disease pathogenesis including PTPN2 2, CTLA4, CD4 0LG etc.. These examples highlight potential new avenues towards understanding autoimmunity via investigation into alternate mRNA transcript production rather than focusing solely upon single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with susceptibility loci discovered over many years now. As discussed above several SNPs located near TNFAIP3 appear linked directly to altered transcription rates thereby implicating transcriptional control pathways downstream of key inflammatory mediators like TNFα itself. However further study needs to determine if any SNP effects act alone or interact synergistically together with epigenetic factors affecting chromatin structure leading ultimately to changes in promoter accessibility across multiple target sites throughout the genome. Epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation status, histone modification states and nucleosome positioning along genomic regions surrounding promoters often referred to collectively as “epigenomes ”. Recent advances allow high throughput sequencing techniques capable of interrogating epigenomic landscapes allowing us unprecedented insight regarding dynamic alterations occurring after cellular stimulation especially given our current knowledge about genetic variation underlying complex diseases. Thus far most attention focused primarily on CpG islands proximal to TSS yet emerging data indicates significant complexity beyond what had originally anticipated even though much effort continues being invested here too. One exciting area involves identification of long range interactions linking distant enhancers upstream of cytokine coding sequences e.g. IL1 7A locus with distal elements controlling IL2 3R expression highlighting novel ways whereby enhancer activity spreads out away from core cis acting motifs without necessarily requiring direct physical contact between two locations. Another interesting finding relates to intergenic transcribed RNAs whose precise biological significance remain unknown despite having already implicated numerous molecules therein. While still relatively unexplored, future investigations should focus increasingly on identifying additional epigenetically regulated targets lying close proximity to GWAS hits particularly since large scale consortia efforts continue unlocking vast amounts of information concerning global transcriptome profiles before finally defining causal relationships. Finally, whilst great strides forward seem possible based largely due to technological developments described earlier, major challenges lie ahead related mainly relating to translating discoveries made hitherto almost exclusively ex vivo experimentally into clinical benefit. Nevertheless progress seems likely once appropriate animal models become available enabling detailed dissection of molecular networks operating physiologically alongside environmental influences shaping host responses against pathogens versus self antigens driving chronic auto reactivity. Such insights would undoubtedly facilitate rational design strategies aimed specifically at correcting aberrant immunological processes underpinning pathological outcomes seen today. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > JG wrote first draft manuscript.
