 were made; however their pattern was not as stable over time compared to males (Figure 1). We also found significant correlations between behavioral measures such as perseverative errors on one arm versus other arms during learning trials vs. choice bias at test suggesting some degree of overlap among strategies used within each group – though there is no evidence yet from our data whether females use distinct strategy than do males when faced with an ambiguous situation like choosing which option will win $5 0 / £2 7 = 3 4% chance reward ratio - see below. These results suggest important qualitative distinctions exist regarding what constitutes optimal approach toward rewards depending upon biological factors including gender. The observed difference may reflect fundamental neurobiological mechanisms related either directly to dopamine signaling pathways known to modulate goal directed behaviors [6 8] or indirectly through interactions involving estrogen receptors expressed throughout many brain regions involved in cognition and emotion regulation [9, 1 0]. In addition, it has recently become clear that estrogens can influence both dopaminergic activity levels and receptor expression profiles thereby providing another potential mechanism whereby hormones might affect neural circuits mediating adaptive responses towards rewarding stimuli [1 1]. Future studies should examine if manipulations altering hormonal status alter specific aspects of mouse foraging decisions thus allowing further mechanistic insights into possible roles played by gonadal steroids in modulating complex social information processing systems. It would seem likely that future work examining genetic models affecting neurotransmitter function associated with risk alleles identified using GWAS analysis will reveal additional insight about molecular underpinnings governing human variation in economic preferences. Finally, while computational methods offer great promise for understanding heterogeneity amongst individuals who share identical genotypes, much remains unknown concerning sources influencing inter-subject variability in animal model phenotypes. This includes environmental influences beyond those examined here — e.g. maternal care received prior to weaning age, early life stress exposure etc ….. Thus despite its limitations, modeling species typical traits provides valuable opportunities to understand basic principles driving evolutionary adaptation under natural conditions where selection pressures differ greatly relative to laboratory settings. As discussed above, recent advances highlight the importance of considering multiple dimensions rather than focusing solely on mean values alone since subtle changes along any dimension lead to large shifts in phenotypic variance leading ultimately to increased power to detect effects otherwise masked due to high noise level inherent in most experimental paradigms. For example, although previous reports indicate little effect size change following manipulation of serotonin transporter gene dosage, others find substantial increases in trait heritability after accounting for non-additive contributions arising from epistasis [1 2].Such considerations underscore the need for multi dimensional analyses incorporating several biologically plausible hypotheses simultaneously whenever feasible given limited sample sizes available today. Moreover, consideration must always go hand in glove with careful design so that experiments yield meaningful outcomes without confounding artifacts introduced inadvertently owing to uncontrolled parameters being manipulated experimentally. Although statistical techniques developed specifically designed to address issues raised herein continue to evolve rapidly, continued development promises new avenues forward enabling greater precision medicine efforts targeting personalized treatment options tailored according to unique characteristics exhibited by patients suffering neurological diseases characterized by abnormal sociocognitive abilities. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃
