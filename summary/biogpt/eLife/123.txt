 rescued cell susceptibility toward all tested primate HBVs including gibbon ape leukemia virus type 1 pseudotyped particles as well as authentic infectious virions from chimpanzees or humans infected naturally or experimentally. These results demonstrate an essential role played by NTCP during host range expansion among primates at least within hominoids / Old World monkeys clade. Our study also provides proof-ofprinciple evidence supporting potential use of nonhuman NHPs such as chimpanzee model system not only studying basic virology but also developing new antiviral therapeutics against chronic hepadnavirus- induced hepatocellular carcinoma. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < ABSTRACT > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Hepaciviridae, Hepatitis Virus E, Host Range Expansion, Receptor Identification, Viral Entry Mechanism < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Abbreviations used in this paper: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > aa, Amino acid; CHB, Chronic hepatits C patients; Co 2 + -NTA Ni Sepharose High Performance column chromatography columns; DMEM Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium; DNA, Deoxyribonucleic Acid; EDTA Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid EGTA ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid FBS Fetal Bovine Serum HA Hemagglutinin epitope tag HIV-G VSV glycoprotein gene derived vector HCV Hepatitis c virus HCVpp Infection competent pseudoparticles containing genotype 2a JFH1 genome; HCVcc Cell culture produced JFH strain based on Huh 6. 5.1 clone 3 Huh7 hepatoma cell line HEPES 4- [2- hydroxyethyl] -1 piperazineethanesulfonic acid hNTCP human Na + -dependent bile salt uptake carrier HuH-7OK1 immortalized hepatocyte cell lines expressing endogenous wild-type huNTCP HVR hypervariable regions LHBs Large surface antigen MLV Murine Leukemia Viruses MOI Multiplicity Of Infections NPC1L1 Niemann Pick C1 Like L1 Protein ORF Open Reading Frame PCR Polymerase Chain Reaction PEG Polyethyleneglycole PHHs Primary Hepatocytes PHA Phytohemagglutinin peptide RT Room Temperature SDS Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate SEM Standard Error Mean SNV Single Nucleotide Variant TCA Taurocholate TUDCA Tauro Bisursodeoxycholate TUDC Ursodeoxycholyltaurine WT Wild Type YTS Yeast Two Hybrid System Y2H yeast two hybrid assay systems < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Summary < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > This work identified cellular factor responsible for species specificity between non-permissive rhesus macaque hepatocytes and highly pathogenic genotypes 1a & 1b of human hepatitis b virus through comparative genomics analysis followed up functional validation studies. It provided important information about molecular mechanism underlying evolution process leading to emergence of novel strains capable of infecting humans.Significance Statement < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > How does one identify receptors mediating specific interactions between enveloped RNA genomes and target membranes remains challenging due largely to lack of suitable experimental models amenable to genetic manipulation. In particular, identification of factors involved in interspecies transmission events has been hampered because most animal hosts do not support efficient replication of their own homologous pathogens thus precluding direct comparison across different species.The discovery described here represents significant progress towards understanding mechanisms governing inter-mammalian transmissions which may lead ultimately into successful development of effective vaccines targeting zoonotic agents causing emerging epidemics worldwide like Zika fever caused by flavivirus West Nile Fever virus etc.. Furthermore it will help us understand why some animals can be persistently colonized whereas others cannot even tolerate certain persistent pathogen infection.We believe our approach could serve as paradigm shift allowing rapid elucidation of other critical steps required for establishment of productive interaction between various types of enveloped nucleic acid carrying virion particle families e.g. retroviruses versus paramyxoviruses etc. along evolutionary history involving many millions years since divergence time of individual lineages before they became extinct. Finally, given recent advances made recently regarding engineering humanized mice harboring fully differentiated livers providing opportunities to test efficacy of anti-virals developed initially utilizing primary cultures of normal adult human liver.This strategy should allow testing whether any newly discovered candidate molecules reported herein would inhibit infectivity of diverse members belonging to distinct genera i.e. Retroviridae.Further characterization of additional putative interacting partners might shed light onto yet another facet pertaining to complex interplay occurring inside living organisms where each component plays crucial roles either directly or indirectly regulating overall physiological processes ranging form metabolism regulation via hormones signaling pathways activation over immune responses modulation thereby affecting pathogenesis outcome upon exposure to invading microbes. Thus far there was no report describing systematic screening approaches aimed at identifying determinants controlling tropism restriction vs. permissiveness amongst closely phylogenetically linked groups of mammals sharing similar ecological niches under natural conditions without prior knowledge beforehand except those cases when phylogenetic relatedness allowed prediction of possible candidates playing pivotal functions facilitating intergenus transmission.Overall current data presented suggest that although much effort needs still dedicated to further characterize remaining unknowns associated with early stages of life cycle preceding formation of mature progeny virions following initial attachment step, future efforts focusing mainly on characterizing post fusion stage after release of nucleocapsid core structure bearing genomic material seems likely going forward making sense considering high degree conservation observed throughout entire coding sequences encoding structural components shared by several classes of positive strand ssRNA segmented
