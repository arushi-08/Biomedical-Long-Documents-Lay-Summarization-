 development during infancy / toddlerhood when infants first learn about others' actions through gaze cues.

LAY SUMMARY ▃ The neural mechanisms that underlie typical versus atypically developing infant behavior remain poorly understood despite their importance for understanding developmental trajectories across multiple domains including language acquisition. We used an innovative approach combining behavioral measures from video recordings taken while children watched videos depicting human interactions together with neuroimaging techniques on awake young participants at rest to identify differences associated with individual variation within one domain - looking time towards faces vs. eyes vs mouth regions. Our results suggest there might exist subtypes among autistic individuals based upon patterns of spontaneous look times toward different facial features which could have important implications regarding clinical heterogeneity observed throughout childhood into adulthood. These novel insights will help inform future studies investigating neurodevelopmental disorders involving abnormal functioning or structure along specific circuits involved in processing information presented via face stimuli.
