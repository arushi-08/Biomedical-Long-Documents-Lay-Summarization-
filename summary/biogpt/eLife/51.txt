; however, our measurements show they also limit capillary visibility by scattering photons from passing red blood cells.We present an overview of recent advances made possible through optical coherence tomography with high frame rates combined with computational methods for measuring cellular motion at video rate per second over large areas on retinas ranging up to4 mm × 6 cm.These new tools will enable researchers studying disease progression as well as drug delivery applications such as gene therapy where it is critical to know when drugs reach their target tissue before any therapeutic effect can be measured. Our results demonstrate that even though mice lack true color vision like humans do, there exist mechanisms similar enough so far studied in human eyes to allow them detect changes caused by genetic mutations affecting cone photoreceptors - which cause achromatopsia -using only blue wavelengths visible via cones' opsin proteins. In addition, because all other known visual pigments absorb longer wavelength radiation than those found in rods and cones, spectral sensitivity curves obtained here may help predict what colors would appear if optogenetic therapies were applied directly into murine retinas.The ability to image individual moving RBCs has allowed us to determine RBC velocity distributions along major vessels down to ~ 7 μm ∕ s. By comparing velocities between arteries vs. veins and among different vascular regions, including arteriovenous shunts, we find evidence suggesting that local hemodynamics play important roles not just during normal physiological conditions but under pathological states too. For example, while arterial flows tend toward higher values compared to venous ones due primarily to larger diameter ratios, both artery & vein walls exhibit significant heterogeneity in speed distribution patterns throughout each region examined. Finally, since many studies rely upon histological sectioning techniques involving fixation steps followed bystaining procedures designed specifically for particular tissues types, future work could benefit greatly from combining OCT images acquired non invasively with histology data sets collected after sacrificing experimental animals.With further development, quantitative assessment ofmicrocirculatory parameters should prove useful diagnostically andtherapeutically in various ocular disorders characterized either symptomatically or pathogenically by abnormal microcirculation dynamics. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
