 insects such as beetles and moths where they may play additional roles beyond detection of odors from plants: for example regulation by pheromones. In addition our data indicate independent evolution between two subfamilies within Orthopterans which were previously thought to share common ancestry due their expression patterns on antennae rather than forelegs suggesting convergent functional adaptations during early arthropod radiation. Our study provides new insights into evolutionary origins of chemosensory systems among arthropods including basal lineages like myriapods and crustaceans.This article is part of themed issue 'Evo – devo in the genomics era, and the origin of morphological complexity'.
