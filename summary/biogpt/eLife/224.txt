 stance phase when they need it most: either for initiating movements in response to external perturbations or shifting body mass from side to back as part of gait cycle completion. In contrast with previous studies showing continuous sensory integration throughout all phases of postural tasks [3 – 5] our data suggest discontinuous processing at critical points where optimal performance is required by changing task requirements. This finding supports recent theoretical models suggesting discontinuity may be important feature underlying sensorimotor behavior across multiple levels within human nervous system including perception / action coupling, decision making etc.. Our study provides evidence supporting discontinuity hypothesis which has been proposed based on computational modeling but not yet demonstrated experimentally. We propose future work should investigate whether similar patterns exist among other types of dynamic behaviors involving changes in state variables over short timescales like saccades, smooth pursuit eye movements.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Continuity hypotheses have received considerable attention recently due to its potential importance both theoretically and practically; however there remains limited experimental support demonstrating them empirically. Here we demonstrate discrete breaks occurring prior to execution of specific behavioral actions providing empirical validation of predictions derived from optimality principles regarding stability under change conditions. Furthermore, given known differences in brain structure related to different modes of coordination, further investigation into possible dissociations along anatomical pathways could help elucidate common features shared amongst various forms of coordinated activity. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
