These analyses reveal novel insights about the extent of alternative splicing events taking places upon infecting epithelial lung cancer A5 4 9s Cells were grown according to standard protocols Cell lysates collected after 3 hours of either mock treatment or low multiplicity IAV inoculation were processed immediately without freezing prior to library preparation All samples had approximately 5 million mapped paired ends sequenced resulting in ~ 8 7 M pairs of uniquely aligned read fragments Total counts obtained before normalization revealed no significant differences among replicates but did indicate clear strain variation; however, similar numbers of differentially regulated transcripts could still be identified regardless if normalized against total number of mappable bases or RPM values Figure Differential Regulation Is Not Due to Changes in Transcript Abundance Rather Thes Are Accompanied Primarily by Alterations in Translation Rates First, since relative amounts do change dramatically amongst groups, any observed difference should therefore reflect true biological effect Size distribution plots comparing fold changes calculated based solely on total count vs. ratio calculations showed very good correlation indicating minimal bias introduced by normalizing ratios towards overall amount of detected sequence Reads mapping exclusively onto coding regions displayed much greater variance compared to non-CDS sequences suggesting higher error rate likely stems primarily from technical noise generated mainly because fewer unique alignments exist outside annotated exons Despite having relatively small sample sizes, statistical significance testing indicated hundreds of significantly altered transcripts in response to IAV challenge Both IPA pathway enrichment Analysis Based on known functions of corresponding encoded products and literature mining allowed identification of functional categories overrepresented in particular sets of DEGs Table Among upregulated targets, GO terms related to interferon alpha beta receptor binding followed closely by type I IFN activation Signaling cascades leading to NF kappa B nuclear translocation and subsequent upregulation of pro inflammatory cytokines and chemokines constitute major antiviral defense strategies Targeting mitochondrial respiration represents another means employed by some pathogenic microbes to inhibit ATP biosynthesis While respiratory chain inhibitors may affect general metabolism, especially glycolysis If metabolic reprogramming plays role in supporting viral growth, blocking electron transport would reduce oxygen consumption thereby reducing ROS accumulation and potentially limiting damage imposed by elevated superoxide concentrations Mitochondrial membrane potential assays performed three days postinfection confirmed reduced basal level OCR consistent with impaired OXPHOS capacity Overall, despite showing large variations in susceptibility toward IAV infection even though originating from identical genetic backgrounds, the majority of tested clones exhibited comparable behavior regarding sensitivity to IAV stress. Thus, although clonal selection might influence certain phenotypic traits, intrinsic properties inherent to parental lines appear largely responsible for determining resistance phenotypes. Moreover, given previous reports demonstrating heterogeneity present already early stages of tumor development Further investigation will help determine whether resistant subclones arise de novo during tumorigenesis Alternatively, increased tolerance seen earlier in culture suggests existence of preexisting subpopulations capable of surviving longer periods of time Following establishment of stable populations derived from sensitive isolates, further characterization experiments focused on identifying molecular markers linked to enhanced survival capabilities found consistently overexpressed in selected sub cultures. One candidate marker chosen out of four candidates studied - CD9 8hc Expression profiles measured six passages later suggested initial increase in surface localization accompanied by gradual decrease thereafter (Fig. Taken altogether, these observations point strongly forward to involvement of mitochondria dysfunction in promoting long term adaptation enabling prolonged viability of susceptible cells. Since defective mtDNA mutations affecting ETC subunits lead to severe impairment of aerobic oxidation, loss of normal functioning causes decreased efficiency of adenosine triphosphate synthase Complex V causing excessive proton leak and consequently lower intracellular pH Maintenance of proper redox balance appears crucial for sustaining optimal proliferation rates High throughput screening methods designed around
