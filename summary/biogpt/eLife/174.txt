 role for genetics as it relates not only to chemical ecology but also evolutionary biology more broadly. The results suggest an important link from chemistry through evolution towards adaptation at both local (e.g. host plants) or global scales such as climate change scenarios where novel genotypes can potentially evolve rapidly under selection pressure imposed on them due to changes in environment conditions over time. Our study highlights some key questions regarding adaptive responses which will need further investigation including: How do multiple selective forces interact together during speciation events; What is driving divergence among populations / ecotype groups when they have similar phenotypes yet differ genetically? And what drives rapid phenotypic shifts following major climatic transitions like those experienced globally today? Answering each question requires knowledge beyond simple associations based solely upon genotype data alone given our limited understanding of gene function underlying metabolic pathways involved in specialization mechanisms. Future studies should focus on combining genomic approaches along side metabolomics analyses so researchers gain insight into functional aspects associated with genes encoding enzymes responsible for synthesis and modification reactions leading up to production of particular compounds found throughout nature [1 – 3]. In addition future work could include analysis using other types of molecular markers linked directly to candidate biosynthetic pathway components rather than single nucleotide polymorphisms identified via association mapping methods used here since many non-coding regions likely play roles determining trait differences observed amongst individuals belonging to closely related taxa. Finally, there remains much room for improvement if one wants to fully integrate genomics information alongside traditional phytochemical profiling techniques thereby providing greater insights into biochemical functions underpinning ecologically significant traits especially considering recent advances made possible thanks to next generation sequencing technologies now being applied widely around us. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > A total number of 2 0 8 A. thaliana accession were grown hydroponically according to previously described protocols. Briefly seeds collected randomly distributed onto soil pots containing vermiculite supplemented with Hoagland ’ s nutrient solution was placed inside plastic containers filled with water saturated air bubbled continuously above seedlings until germination occurred after 4 days incubation period. Seedlings then transferred individually to individual tubes consisting of 5 0ml distilled H2O sealed tightly capped glass vials fitted loosely fitting polypropylene caps allowing gas exchange without disturbing seedling growth while maintaining humidity levels close to saturation level set point value 6 9% ± 1SD. Tubes remained submerged overnight before removal daily prior to collection of samples representing day zero biomass harvest stage corresponding approximately four weeks post seed sowing date. At least three biological replicates per line comprising two technical replicate extractions performed separately resulting altogether nine independent sample sets comprised of five whole rosettes harvested simultaneously. Samples stored frozen immediately below − 8 0C ° C till extraction procedure commenced. All experiments involving live organisms followed guidelines outlined in European Union Council Directive No. 8 6\ 6 0 9 EEC concerning animal experimentation and approved by University College London Ethics Committee.

Raw mass spectral files acquired automatically every second cycle were processed manually and peak areas integrated using AMDIS software package version NIST library build 2 0 1 2v1 against retention index libraries built locally. Peak area values extracted for known standards present in the mixture analysed provided internal calibration curves enabling quantification relative abundance determination. Further detailed description of analytical methodology employed herein has been published recently. Data processing steps included quality control checks ensuring no outliers had entered subsequent statistical calculations. Multivariate statistics implemented in SIMCA P + v.1 3. 0.1 plus R packages vegans v2. 5.2 and plyr v3. 6.0 enabled identification of variables differentiating experimental treatments whilst multivariate regression models constructed employing lasso algorithm allowed prediction performance estimation. Principal component scores plots displayed clustering pattern indicating separation achieved mainly because of treatment effects whereas principal axis loadings plot revealed variable contribution attributed primarily to primary metabolome composition i.e. sugars alcohols carboxylic acids esters etc.. Hierarchical cluster heatmap visualisation depicted grouping tendency explained largely by secondary metabolomes profile variations detected therein.
