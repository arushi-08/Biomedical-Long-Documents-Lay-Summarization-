 RNA synthesis from alternative core promoter elements (Figure 7). In addition we found no significant differences between wild-type- and Tbp heterozygous myoblasts when cultured under differentiating conditions suggesting there may also exist other mechanisms by which cells regulate levels of functional TATA box binding protein complexes at target loci independent of changes in total cellular concentrations [1 0 – 3 5]. It will therefore now become important to identify additional factors involved in regulating tissue specificity through differential utilization of distinct classes of transcriptional regulatory sequences within different tissues such as skeletal muscles versus brain neurons where both neuronal development and function require precise regulation of neuron subtype specification programs while maintaining plasticity throughout life span. Our results suggest it would then be interesting if future studies could investigate possible roles played by TAFs beyond those associated specifically with either classical TATA- containing class II enhancers or non-consensus initiator element recognition sites located upstream of many developmentally regulated mammalian housekeeping genes including MyoD itself. These observations highlight another layer of complexity underlying our understanding about general principles governing eukaryotic genome organization: what determines selective usage of particular types of cis DNA sequence motifs across diverse biological contexts remains unclear but likely involves combinatorial interactions among multiple trans acting regulators working together along chromatin templates rather than simple binary switches based solely on presence vs. absence of individual activators bound directly adjacent to cognate response elements. Finally, since most human diseases arise due to mutations affecting key signaling pathways controlling normal growth patterns over time, identification of novel therapeutic targets should include consideration of temporal aspects related to dynamic alterations occurring in signal transduction networks involving various combinations of positive and negative feedback loops operating downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases like FGFR family members known to play critical role in myogenic progenitor proliferation and terminal maturation events leading up to formation of mature myofibers capable of sustained contraction necessary for proper functioning of striated musculature system. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by Institutional Animal Care Committee (IACUC  A0 9 8 4 6; Protocol Number A1 0MDIAY) following NIH guidelines regarding care and use of laboratory animals. Mice used included C5 7BL / 6J strain obtained commercially (Jackson Laboratories Stock No. 0 0 0 6 6M4). Generation of Tbp2 − / + has been described elsewhere. Briefly, embryonic stem clone EPD0 6 8 7aD0 9Rik harboring targeted disruption allele Tbp2tm1Dgen generated using BayGenomics ES Cell Gene Trap Resource Facility targeting strategy designed against exon two region encoding part of T Box domain present only in isoform b variant mRNA transcript corresponding to amino acids residues 1 - 1 1 3 out of ~ 2 5 5aa long full length murine TBP2.b. Heterozygous male chimeras derived after blastocyst injection transmitted mutant alleles via germline into F1 generation generating homozygous offspring lacking any residual wildtype transcripts detected thus far. Genotyping primers utilized for detection of WT and KO genotypes were forward primer P1 = CCTCTATGTGCTGGAGTTCTGG reverse primer2 = AGAAGCAGATTTTGGACCACAG yielding PCR products sizes respectively ∼ 1 kb & ∼ 1Kb representing respective wt and knockout genomic DNAs amplified product size confirmed later by sequencing analyses shown below. For genotyping purposes all three available exons spanning regions encompassing intron junctions flanking each deleted coding segment were analyzed simultaneously utilizing multiplex RT-qPCR approach employing TaqMan probes labeled FAM ™ dye conjugated sense strand probe directed towards exon1a junction site common to all isoforms followed by VIC ® -labeled antisense stranded probeset detecting unique portions encoded separately by Exons 1b, 1c and 1d variants. Primers amplifying Exon 1A fragment yielded expected sized amplicon whereas amplification reactions carried out independently for Exon1B, 1C and 1D fragments resulted in amplicons ranging approximately from ≈ 1 0bp to ≈ 4kbp depending primarily on number of introns retained post deletion event thereby allowing simultaneous quantification of relative abundance of remaining four alternatively spliced mRNAs resulting ultimately in estimation of overall level of loss of entire set of functionally active TBP2b splice forms compared to its complete ablation seen earlier biochemically. Homozygous males bred successfully producing litters comprising Mendelian ratios indicating viability despite near ubiquitous distribution pattern observed histologically around E1 0 stage embryos showing severe defects especially evident in developing heart ventricles consistent with previous reports describing early lethality phenotypes arising prior e1 0 stages. Embryos harvested before day E9 showed similar gross morphological abnormalities although they did survive until birth albeit exhibiting significantly smaller body weight even though still viable postnatally confirming requirement of TBPs ’ functions well past mid gestation period. To generate experimental cohorts consisting exclusively of female breeders carrying floxed conditional knock down alleles, females bearing loxP flanked Tbx2 locus were crossed first with CMV Cre transgenic line expressing cre recombinase ubiquitously so as to obtain progeny having one copy of inactivated Tbx2.f chromosome paired with second inactive Tbx * -d chromosome inherited maternally hence referred herein simply as “cKO ” genotype i.e. Tbx.f.Δ X Tm1.Tg. Subsequent crosses allowed us to produce F2 progenies possessing single copies of recombined chromosomes designated as cKOs whose mothers had received tamoxifen injections starting just prior mating till weaning age essentially ensuring inactivation of maternal flox chromosomal segments leaving paternal ones unaffected except for some degree of mosaicism possibly reflecting incomplete penetrance inherent nature
