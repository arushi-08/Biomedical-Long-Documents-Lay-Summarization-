 selection for incorporation into assembling virions as well as their co-localization at sites where they assemble may be critical determinants underlying efficient virion production from infected cells [2 – 4]. Understanding mechanisms governing specific interactions between retroviral proteins (e.g. Gag) with nucleic acids will help us understand fundamental aspects of retrovirus biology such as replication fidelity or evolution during infection / transmission cycles within hosts. Moreover it could lead to new strategies aimed either towards inhibiting infectivity through interfering directly with early steps required for successful establishment of infections but also toward developing novel antiviral therapies targeting late stages essential for progeny particle formation without affecting host cell functions. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > This work was supported by grants R0 1AI0 8 3 7 9 6; {"type": "entrez-nucleotide", "attrs": {"text": "AI1 0 7 1 0 1"}} AI1 0 7 1 0 1- “Retroviruses ” awarded jointly under NIAID award  HHSN2 7ID-OC0 0 2P5 0D0 1 0 9 2 1 - ‘ Virology & Pathogenesis' program funded by NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs operated by NCI Center Core Support Grant P3 0- CA0 1 6 0 5 6DHHS.

(2 3M, pdf) < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Representative images showing colocalization experiments performed using GUVs containing different combinations of fluorescently labeled lipids and protein components described above. Scale bars = 5μm. Figures S2 A-C show representative confocal microscopy Z stacks obtained after imaging individual GUV samples shown Fig 2A. Panels D-F shows fluorescence intensity profiles along line scans drawn across selected regions corresponding to single particles observed in Figs Figs2B2B and and3A3A respectively. Panel G represents average pixel intensities measured over multiple lines taken perpendicular to each other around identified spots representing assembled structures seen in panel F. For panels H-J we have included additional examples illustrating various types of assemblies formed upon incubation of GagΔp6 alone (I), GagΔp6 + MA WT -mCherry together with PI (4, 5P) P2 liposomes only (II), GagΔp6 + MA W1 6A mutant plus PI (4, 5P) P liposome mixture (III), GagΔp6 + NC WT -GFP mixed with PS lipid bilayer doped with trace amounts of Rhodamine PE dye (IV), GagΔp6 wt incubated with SUPER templates supplemented with HeLa cytosol extract (V), and finally full length wild type- GFP expressed transiently transfected HEK2 9 3T cells stained live before fixation followed by staining fixed permeabilized cells post permeabilization step (VI). Please note that due to differences inherent among sample preparations some variations can occur even though all measurements reported herein represent typical results based on several independent replicates conducted independently. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Additional File 2: Movie S1.mov depicting time lapse series acquired following addition of unlabeled tRNAs to preformed fluorescent complexes composed of GagΔp6 * -mEosFP, Alexa Fluor ® -5 5 5- DOGS-NTA (Ni) incorporated DOPC LUVs ± rhodamine DHPE LUVs prepared according to protocol illustrated schematically below. Images presented correspond to frames recorded every second starting immediately prior to adding tRNAs until complete disappearance of signal indicating disassembly process underway. Note that while most signals disappear rapidly once added, small residual clusters remain visible throughout observation period suggesting slow dissociation kinetics consistent with previous observations made via FCS studies carried out similarly employing similar experimental setup.
