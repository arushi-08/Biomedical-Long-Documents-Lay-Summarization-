 can be interpreted either as an adaptive strategy for coping with environmental constraints or alternatively it could reflect genetic differentiation among populations due to past bottlenecks associated with range expansion from southern latitudes into northern Europe after glacial retreat ∼ 1 0 kya. The latter scenario seems more likely because we found no evidence supporting population structure based solely upon birth date within our sample set; however further studies should investigate whether there might exist subpopulations at different stages along their migration route which would require additional markers such as mtDNA sequences instead of just nuclear microsatellites used here. Our data also indicate potential fitness costs related to delayed emergence time: although both groups had high reproductive success when they emerged simultaneously, females emerging later were less successful if breeding occurred earlier afterwards suggesting trade off mechanisms rather than direct physiological consequences caused by delay per se. We conclude that future investigations will need to consider not only age / size class composition but additionally other life history traits like timing of spring onset, phenology length etc.. Furthermore, given its importance regarding ecological interactions e.g. predator – prey relationships, detailed knowledge about ontogenetic changes throughout ontogeny including heterothermy has implications beyond terrestrial mammals especially concerning conservation biology since many species show strong seasonal fluctuations across seasons even though some do so over several years [3 6]. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Dormouse, Heterothermic mammal, Life cycle stage transition, Birth dates, Body condition index, Energy budget parameters, Winter mortality rate, Fecundity < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > A large number of animals exhibit daily cycles characterized by alternating periods of activity versus rest known collectively as circadian rhythms. Many organisms display endogenous circannual rhythmicity driven primarily through photoperiod cues perceived via photoreceptors located outside eyes called photoperiodism while others rely exclusively on temperature signals provided mainly by ambient temperatures themselves termed thermoperiodicity [2 5]. However, most temperate zone endotherms experience substantial variation in day lengths around summer solstice every few months whereas mean annual air temperatures remain relatively stable except near freezing conditions occurring annually in Scandinavia where snow cover lasts until mid April followed shortly thereafter by snowmelt resulting in short days typical for arctic regions. Thus, under natural circumstances cold winters represent major challenges requiring adaptation strategies allowing them to survive without food resources available all together despite limited energy reserves stored prior to entering dormancy. To cope with harsh climatic events, hibernating vertebrates often undergo profound metabolic depression accompanied typically by reduced heart rates leading eventually to deep hypothermia below − 8 ° C thus enabling extended times spent underground compared to non ‐ dormant states [4 9]. Hibernation allows long term storage of fuel necessary for subsequent arousal processes required periodically once favourable weather resumes thereby ensuring continued foraging activities post ‐ estivation [7]. Although numerous aspects underlying regulation of mammalian hibernation still remains unclear, recent advances revealed significant roles played particularly by thyroid hormones acting centrally regulating metabolism coupled directly onto peripheral tissues involved in thermogenesis [2 1]. Thyroid hormone levels increase dramatically immediately preceding entrance into hypometabolic state reaching peak values already one week ahead of expected awakening indicating involvement of central regulatory pathways controlling entry into hibernation phase [2 1]. Moreover, previous work demonstrated marked reduction in plasma thyroxine concentrations coinciding well with initiation of spontaneous arousals pointing towards possible role of hypothalamic thyrotropin releasing factor neurons mediating stimulatory effect exerted specifically on thyrotropic cells producing triiodothyronine essential for maintaining euthermia [2 1]. Interestingly, brain deiodinase type II enzyme responsible for conversion of inactive prohormonal T4 molecule back up to bioactive T3 form appears highly expressed selectively in hypothalamus providing another level of control whereby availability of biologically potent ligand determines expression pattern of genes regulated downstream i.e. those encoding proteins implicated in thermogenic response [2 1]. It must therefore come down naturally why certain animal taxa appear capable of surviving prolonged exposure to severe coldness regardless of having evolved adaptations permitting sustained maintenance of homeothermic core body temperature close to zero degree Celsius yet fail otherwise. One possibility suggested recently involves existence of two distinct modes operating concurrently namely “facultative ” vs. obligate mode depending largely on individual ability to maintain normothermic status irrespective of external factors triggering induction process [2 0]. While obligatory mechanism requires continuous presence of sufficient amount of substrate needed for sustaining basal heat production above minimal threshold value maintained constant independent of any exogenous stimuli, alternative approach relies entirely on internal homeostatic controls keeping pace with changing environment forcing organism's thermoregulatory system constantly adapting itself accordingly [2 0]. As mentioned previously, considerable progress made toward understanding molecular basis governing transitions between various phases characterizing vertebrate lifestages provides valuable insights into evolutionary forces shaping phenotypic diversity observed today amongst extant forms inhabiting diverse habitats ranging widely apart geographically encompassing vast majority of Earth biome types [1 8]. Therefore comparative analysis involving multiple representatives representing wide spectrum of taxonomic classes exhibiting contrasting lifestyles represents crucial step forward facilitating better comprehension of evolution driving diversification phenomena affecting entire living world ecosystems.
