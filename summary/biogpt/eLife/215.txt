 functions can contribute to new functional roles during development We also show here an example where changes at one position within DNA recognition motif affect both protein – DNA interactions directly but more importantly they alter chromatin accessibility indirectly through changing nucleosome occupancy patterns. These results suggest mechanisms whereby mutations affecting only single nucleotides may lead to dramatic phenotypic effects without necessarily disrupting direct molecular contacts; instead such alterations might cause indirect disruption via modifying local epigenetic landscape. Our study provides insights into evolutionary constraints on gene regulation across multiple taxa including humans, mice, worms, yeast cells, plants etc … It suggests possible ways forward towards understanding complex phenotypes from sequence alone: first identifying key genes whose altered activity is likely responsible for observed phenotype then determining their precise role based upon knowledge about transcriptional networks controlling those important developmental processes. Finally it highlights potential pitfalls when interpreting non coding variants identified either experimentally or computationally because most studies focus solely on identification rather than characterization of causal alleles. In particular our work shows that while many disease associated SNPs fall outside known TFBS there remains considerable value in experimental determination of allele dependent differential affinity of candidate regulators toward target sites - especially if combined with information regarding co-factor dependencies -thus providing valuable mechanistic insight beyond what would otherwise emerge simply from computational predictions. Overall, given its simplicity and high throughput nature ChIP-seq represents arguably best suited approach for large scale mapping of genome wide maps of all major classes of genomic features involved in regulating cellular differentiation programs throughout ontogeny. However, future efforts should aim to improve resolution along several dimensions before obtaining truly comprehensive datasets required for reliable interpretation of individual variant effect sizes. For instance combining complementary approaches like ATAC-Seq will help identify open regions bound exclusively by pioneer / master regulator TFs vs. other accessible loci occupied later in lineage commitment process e.g. enhancers activated after initial recruitment of pioneering factors. Similarly integration of additional epigenomic marks obtained under various conditions shall allow us better understand combinatorial rules governing enhancer activation states over time thereby enabling accurate prediction of impact of any mutation occurring therein. Ultimately however, despite significant progress made recently [1 0 4], current technologies still suffer certain limitations limiting further expansion of coverage depth particularly among lower vertebrates. Thus although some improvements were reported in recent years, overall performance characteristics remain far below expectations considering expected gains offered by next generation sequencing platforms coupled with improved library preparation protocols [5 3 6 7 8 9]. Furthermore, technical biases introduced due to uneven distribution of reads around TSS limit applicability of RNA Pol II profiling techniques like GRO-cap and PRO-Cap being limited mostly to nascent transcripts produced shortly following initiation events whereas ChIPmentation offers higher sensitivity albeit requiring longer processing times making it less suitable for routine use. As discussed above, alternative strategies involving crosslinking agents followed by sonication seem promising alternatives offering greater flexibility concerning choice of antibodies used against histone modifications allowing simultaneous detection of distinct post translational modification combinations present simultaneously near TSSs and distal promoters alike. Nevertheless, currently available methodologies do offer great promise since they enable unbiased interrogation of entire genomes regardless whether targeted region spans exons, introns, intergenic space etc. promoter proximal sequences encompassing core promoter element, upstream activating motifs, silencers... etc.. Despite substantial advances provided by NGS technology tremendous challenges lie ahead translating vast amounts of biological information--generated primarily thanks to ENCODE project — into clinically useful tools capable of predicting pathogenicity of newly discovered variations. A number of initiatives aimed specifically addressing issues related to clinical relevance of variation calls arising out of whole exome resequencing projects include ClinVar database http: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / clinvar / index.shtml, Exome Variant Server https: / / evs.gs. washington.edu / EVS /, ExAC Browser http: / / exac.broadinstitute.org / download.html. dbSNP Build ID's --Sherry Cambridge dbSNP1 3 7-- NCBI Reference Sequence Database build build3 6.-UCSC Genome BrowsergenomeRnai.cgi & lastly COSMIC Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer cBioPortal www.sanger.ac.uk / cosmic was developed initially aiming to facilitate access to cancer genomics resources facilitating exploration of somatic point mutations--catalogued mainly amongst cancer--and subsequently expanded to encompass germline variants.1 0xGenomics Consortium UK http: / / portal2.genego.com / public ‐ portal / maintainer.html aims to curate curated databases containing detailed annotations relating to inherited disorders. All three aforementioned websites contain extensive lists of diseases linked to pathogenic SNVs though none contains details pertaining to underlying mechanism behind pathogenesis. Although each site includes up to ~ 1million annotated missense substitutions, no attempt whatsoever goes into systematically characterizing mutational consequences vis à vi s normal physiological state nor does anybody consider structural implications thereof. Moreover, unlike OMIM system which focuses almost entirely on Mendelian inheritance pattern, ClinVar reports “Pathogenic ” status merely according to presence of previously described deleterious amino acid substitution whilst ignoring much larger proportion of VUS detected incidentally serendipitously i.e." Likely benign "category comprising majority of cases presenting symptoms similar to already established conditions1 1.Therefore, lack of appropriate annotation hampers effective translation of potentially causative polymorphisms into biologically meaningful conclusions
