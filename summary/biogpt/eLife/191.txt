 can be provided via an alternative route or mechanism operating during intense neuronal activity when massive membrane retrieval occurs through multiple pathways including both classical CME as well as non-canonical forms such as kiss & run fusion events [2 – 4]. This study provides evidence supporting our hypothesis about compensatory recycling modes which we propose may operate under different conditions depending upon whether they require extensive vesicle fission from plasma membrane prior to recovery: “fast ” mode requiring only limited vesiculation while maintaining high fidelity;" slow "mode involving more substantial budding before full restoration of functional pool size requires additional rounds of exo - endo cycling without compromising accuracy. In addition it has been shown recently using super resolution microscopy that some boutons contain two populations of SVs differing significantly regarding mobility within presynaptic terminals indicating possible heterogeneity among individual nerve terminal compartments providing another level of complexity contributing towards regulation of neurotransmitter release efficacy. Thus there appears no doubt that various factors contribute toward fine tuning transmitter output efficiency thereby ensuring optimal information transfer between pre- and postsynaptic cells. It will therefore also become important now if future studies address what molecular players might regulate specific aspects of exo- vs. endocytotic processes involved in maintenance of releasable pools required for efficient neurotransmission. Such knowledge would help us understand better why certain types of mutations affecting proteins implicated directly in either vesicular trafficking machinery itself or those regulating interactions amongst key components lead to neurological disorders associated with cognitive impairment ranging from mild learning disabilities up to severe mental retardation. Finally understanding precisely how distinct regulatory steps control precise timing requirements could allow development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed specifically targeting particular stages along each step so as to restore normal function following disease causing mutation thus preventing progression of pathology due to loss of protein functions. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Synapse plasticity, Synaptic transmission, Endocytosis, Clathrin dependent endocytosis, Non conventional endocytosis, Vesicle transport carriers, Dynamins, Membrane traffic regulators < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Research Highlights < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Efficient functioning of nervous system depends critically on rapid turnover rates achieved primarily though regulated secretion of neurotransmitters packaged inside small clear secretory organelles called synaptic vesicles (SVs). During sustained periods of elevated neural firing many newly formed SVs undergo immediate re-uptake followed immediately thereafter by complete degradation resulting ultimately in depletion of readily available reserve stores. To maintain proper levels of released transmitters several cycles of de novo synthesis must occur continuously throughout life whereas replenishment involves continuous delivery of recycled material back onto active zones making use mainly of constitutive biosynthetic routes although recent reports suggest contribution made predominantly by endosomal intermediates derived mostly form ultrafast internalization occurring exclusively around sites undergoing highly localized Ca + influx known collectively as hot spots termed pickpockets. Although most attention had focused initially solely on identification of molecules responsible for biogenesis of nascent SVs one should keep in mind however other potential sources include direct generation of dense core granules containing neuropeptides e.g. neuropeptide Y etc.. Furthermore given constant demand imposed by ongoing physiological needs any disturbance arising owing to defects in biosynthesis leads inevitably to disruption of homeostatic balance eventually culminating in pathological consequences often manifested clinically later than expected since compensation cannot always take place quickly enough once initial damage becomes manifest. For example genetic deletion of synaptophysin results in early postnatal lethality presumably because lack of essential structural component needed for correct assembly of mature synapse hence precluding effective replacement of lost elements over time. Similarly mice lacking synapsin I exhibit seizures soon post birth reflecting inability to sustain appropriate excitatory drive despite apparently intact basic properties of inhibitory circuits implying insufficient capacity to compensate effectively for compromised inhibition. On the contrary removal of synaptotagmin 7 causes lethal epileptic phenotype probably caused by excessive excitation coupled with reduced ability to replenish depleted reserves highlighting importance of balanced network excitability especially considering role played particularly by GABAergic interneurons whose dysfunction underlies epileptogenesis observed frequently in epilepsy patients. Therefore timely initiation of corrective measures remains critical regardless nature of primary defect present allowing sufficient opportunity for successful rescue unless otherwise fully developed pathologies develop too late perhaps explaining delayed onset phenotypes seen commonly across neurodegenerative diseases characterized pathologically by progressive decline in cellular integrity usually manifesting themselves decades apart. Indeed failure to initiate treatment promptly does indeed result invariably in death underscoring need for prompt intervention irrespective type of disorder being considered. Given all above mentioned considerations together with growing realization emerging largely based partly from work carried out in yeast model systems implicating involvement of unconventional intracellular sorting machineries like ESCRTs etc. in selective cargo selection and packaging much effort directed currently towards identifying candidate genes encoding putative mammalian counterparts capable of performing similar roles seems warranted. However until then very little progress has taken place beyond recognition that numerous human neuropathies arise consequent to malfunction of ubiquitously expressed ubiquitous housekeeping gene products playing crucial yet ill defined roles in fundamental biological activities central to cell survival i.e. metabolism, growth factor signaling cascades... Clearly defining exact identity of functionally equivalent homologues encoded by seemingly unrelated loci mutated in diverse inherited neurodegenerations represents major challenge facing neuroscience today! As discussed below addressing issues related to specificity versus redundancy issue certainly holds great promise going forward. Moreover elucidating detailed mechanistic details concerning discrete stage
