 phenotypes later on through epigenetic mechanisms involving DNA methylation changes within key genes involved with metabolism regulation such as Npy / Agrp neurons but do not affect reproduction directly; however they may contribute indirectly towards infertility because their effect was mediated mainly though reduced body weight gain which leads secondarily impaired fertility potential. These results suggest an important contribution from perinatal nutrition toward adult health outcomes beyond its direct impact upon birth itself. The data presented here support further investigation into whether maternal nutritional interventions could be used therapeutically against metabolic disorders associated with low-grade inflammation caused primarily postnatally rather than prenatally.
