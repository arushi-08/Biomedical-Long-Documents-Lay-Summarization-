 phagocytes contributes towards host defense during K. pneumonia lung infection.ImportanceThis study identifies an important role played by human leukocyte antigen class I C region gene product 2 [also known as Src kinase associated phosphoprotein 1] or SKAP1 – 3 proteins encoded within major histocompatibility complex Class III locus on chromosome 6p2 1. 3 with respect to immunity toward pathogens such as bacteria including Escherichia coli K1 strain RS2 1 8 at both cellular level using primary mouse macrophages from skap1 knockout animals along with cell lines derived thereof and whole animal model system utilizing genetically modified murine models lacking functional SKAP genes under specific conditions like those seen after bone marrow transplantation where donor hematopoietic stem cellslack normal function due to genetic defects resulting inimpaired engraftment into recipient's tissues. Our results suggest that although there may be redundancy among different members of SFK family kinases involved in signal transduction pathway downstream of microbial receptors expressed either directly upon interaction between microbes and target tissue resident leukocytes or indirectly through soluble mediators released following microbe recognition, they all share common molecular targets which can potentially serve as therapeutic drug candidates targeting various infectious diseases caused primarily because of dysregulated inflammatory responses leading to excessive inflammation rather than defective antimicrobial mechanisms per se. Thus our studies identify novel roles played by one member of small adapter molecule group viz: SKAPs in regulating critical functions mediated via myeloid lineage effector molecules thereby contributing not only to anti-tumor but also antibacterial activities. These observations have implications beyond just being limited to understanding pathogenesis related to particular disease states since similar strategies could possibly help us understand other aspects pertaining to regulation of diverse biological processes involving multiple components acting together synergistically across many levels ranging from single receptor interactions down to entire organism physiology. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Adaptor Protein, Innate Immunity, Macrophages, Neutrophils, Reactive Oxygen Species, Signal Transduction Pathway < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Abbreviations used in this paper: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > BM, Bone Marrow Cells; CFU, Colony Forming Units; DPI Diphenyleneiodonium chloride; ELISA Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay; FACS Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting; FITC Fluorescein Isothiocyanate; GM-CSF Granulocyte Macrophage colony stimulating factor G & M Gr.1 + Macs Gr -1 positive population H & E Hematoxylin Eosin staining HRP Horseradish Peroxidase IL Interleukin JNK c Jun N terminal Kinase LPS Lipopolysaccharide MAPK Mitogen activated Protein Kinases MCP Monocyte Chemoattractant Proteins MIP macrophage Inflammatory Mediators NADPH Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate Oxidase NF Nuclear Factor NK Natural Killer PAMP Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern PBS phosphate buffered saline PCR Polymerase Chain Reaction PI3K Phosphoinositide 3 ′ -OH Group Dependent Serine Threonine Kinase PRR pattern Recognition Receptor PMA Phorbol Myristate Acetate ROS Reactive Oxygen Species SAPK Stress Activator Protein Kinase TLR Toll Like Receptors TNF Tumor Necrosis Factors TRAF TNFR Type R Cot Homology Domain Containing Adapter Molecule WT Wild Type Zap 7 0 ζ chain associated protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-7 0 KO Knockout ITAM ImmunoTyrosine Activation Motif WBC White Blood Counts WCL Whole Cellular Lysates Yo Zymosan Y = zymosan Y. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Summary points < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Human Leukocyte Antigen class II Region Gene Product 4 (HLA DR beta chains) has been shown previously to play crucial protective role against Gram negative bacterium Klebsiellae Pneumoniae serotype K4 5 strains causing meningitis. Here we demonstrate that another component namely Small Armadillo Repeat Protein1 (SAR1) plays key regulatory role over HLA DR. Mice deficient in srp1 exhibit increased susceptibility to pneumonic challenge with klebsiella pneumoniae. srp1- / --deficiency does not affect recruitment of polymorphonuclear leucocytes nor do it alter phagocytosis ability suggesting its involvement upstream of bactericidal mechanism. Loss of Srp leads to reduced generation of superoxide radicals indicating possible defect in oxidative burst machinery. Furthermore analysis reveals decreased phospho-Tyr4 9 7src content in PMNs isolated form mutant mice.Taken collectively data presented here suggests potential cross talk exists amongst two distinct classes of Major Histocompatibility Complex loci i.e. MHC IIβ chain and SRP1 wherein each regulates respective part of Immune System thus ensuring efficient functioning of overall adaptive arm of Immune System. srp- / -- -deficient PMN showed diminished capacity to generate Superoxide Radicals while no change observed in hydrogen peroxide generation. srps appears essential for activating SRC Family Kinases.The absence of Srpp renders them unable to activate SYK and BTK hence affecting subsequent steps necessary for generating superoxides radical anions. Hence our work provides evidence supporting existence of crosstalk occurring between two independent parts of Adaptive Immune Systems i.e MHCIIα and SRP1.Such interplay ensures optimal functionality of Total Adaptive Immune Response.. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Conclusion < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Overall current manuscript demonstrates
