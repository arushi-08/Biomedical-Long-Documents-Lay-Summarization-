 transcripts into mature cytoplasmic tRNAs before they can be exported from nuclei by exportin 5 (XPOT). We also find evidence suggesting widespread coupling among decay mechanisms such as co-localization at sites where transcription is initiated; preferential association near 3 'ends within genes encoding ribosomal proteins; enrichment around stop codon regions associated with nonsense mediated decay; correlation across gene families related functionally but not evolutionarily conserved; and coordination during cell cycle progression through periodic expression patterns similar to those observed previously using microarrays [Miller et al]. These results suggest an integrated view of eukaryotic post transcriptional control wherein multiple parallel regulatory networks coordinate diverse aspects of cellular function via common components involved directly in transcript metabolism rather than indirectly affecting them downstream due their roles elsewhere in metabolic signaling cascades. This study provides new insights about global features underlying posttranscriptional controls important throughout eukaryotes ranging from unicellular yeasts like S. cerevisae to multicellular organisms like humans. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Posttranslational Control Mechanisms, Ribosome Biogenesis Factors, Transcription Regulation Network, Gene Expression Programs, Cell Cycle Progression < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > In addition to regulating protein synthesis rates per se, many key regulators controlling growth factor responses have been shown recently to affect both translation efficiency 1 – 4 and ribosome biogenesis 2, which together contribute significantly toward determining overall proteome composition under various conditions. For example, it has long known that nutrient availability affects rRNA production 6 while recent studies show that specific microRNAs regulate pre-rRNAs 7 thereby modulating nucleolar activity 8. Similarly, changes in tRNA abundance 9 influence amino acid incorporation fidelity thus impacting phenotypic diversity even when there were no significant differences seen in total aminoacyl transferase activities measured biochemically 1 0. Thus understanding all facets of post- versus cotranstranslational modifications will likely require comprehensive analyses beyond what was possible just two decades ago since genome sequencing revealed ~ 2Mb coding sequences encoded solely by DNA sequence information contained entirely inside chromosomes without introns nor other intervening genetic elements except small segments called exons separated by noncoding spacers termed intergenic spaces. It seems clear now more generally then ever that our knowledge regarding posttranslational modification events must extend far deeper than simply modifying individual residues either covalently or nonspecifically yet still play critical role in defining biological outcomes especially given increasing realization over time that phosphorylation plays major part in signal transduction systems involving kinases acting upstream of phosphatases working down stream along well characterized biochemical paths leading ultimately resulting in altered phenotypes depending upon whether signals persist until termination occurs properly so that appropriate physiological response ensues despite continued presence of activating stimulus. Given its central importance in biology today, one might expect some form of coordinated mechanism operating globally linking seemingly disparate functions regulated separately at distinct steps would emerge if indeed any single layer could serve as master regulator coordinating numerous layers simultaneously perhaps akin to “orchestrating music ” used widely in modern concert hobbies. Such concerted action may involve direct physical interactions occurring locally e.g. interaction partners interacting physically close enough apart to allow efficient transfer of energy enabling allosteric effects required for proper functioning although indirect means too exist whereby molecules act remotely influencing each others ’ actions though complex webs of molecular communication often spanning several orders of magnitude length scales. A particularly interesting case involves feedback loops whose outputs feed back onto themselves providing additional complexity because once activated certain output parameters tend to return rapidly towards baseline values allowing tight temporal tuning necessary for precise timing needed for normal development whilst inappropriate activation leads to disease states arising out of mistimed dynamics causing uncontrolled proliferation characteristic of cancer metastasis. One way forward lies in identifying shared properties amongst network nodes serving mechanistically unrelated purposes implying existence of universal principles governing higher order organization of intracellular circuits responsible for generating highly sophisticated behaviors essential for life itself. Towards achieving this goal here I present data showing extensive overlap exists between three fundamental modes of posttranscriptional regulations namely initiation coupled turnover, quality assurance checkpoints linked primarily to early stages of maturation prior to export from nucleus etc … Finally my hope should lie in pointing out potential similarities emerging earlier concerning evolution driven emergence of novel forms of combinatorial codes potentially useful against pathogens having evolved resistance strategies targeting host defense programs designed originally intended to protect hosts carrying foreign nucleic acids i.e. RNAi system vs. CRISPR interference technology developed later employing Cas9 nuclease directed cleavage followed by repair facilitated mainly by nonhomologous recombination process employed exclusively by bacteria lacking homologous chromosomal loci targeted by conventional siRNA silencing technologies. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Eukaryotic genomes encode hundreds of thousands of predicted open reading frames corresponding mostly to polypeptides synthesized following decoding of cognate messenger ribonucleic acids- mRNAs--however less abundant species include short interfering double stranded RNAs--siRNAs -antisense strands derived largely from longer dsRNAs transcribed initially outside genomes--micro ribonucleoproteins consisting of Argonaute family members bound respectively to miRNAs -1 7nt fragments generated enzymatically independently of Dicer cleavage-- and piwi class argonauteproteins--1 1bp repeat containing oligonucleotides produced transcriptionally independent oftentimes starting off transposable elements.All four types of ncRNAs interact extensively with target messages promoting endonucleolytic cleavages
