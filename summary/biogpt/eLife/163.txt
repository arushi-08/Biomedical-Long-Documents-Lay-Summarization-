The molecular mechanisms underlying each step remain poorly understood but likely involve coordinated regulation by multiple signaling pathways including those regulated through microRNAs such as miR9 / RE1 silencing transcription factor complex [Reviewed:]. Here, using an innovative genetic tool enabling spatiotemporal control over microRNA activity during early postnatal life, our study provides evidence supporting critical roles played by specific members within highly homologous families at distinct stages throughout neurogenesis from progenitor cells towards mature neurons with functional synapses. We show here that loss or gain of individual components can have different effects on dendrite morphology depending upon their developmental stage suggesting dynamic changes occur between phases when they act cooperatively versus sequentially along differentiation programs leading ultimately toward fully differentiated neuron phenotypes. This work highlights new insights into regulatory networks controlling key aspects of nervous system maturation highlighting potential therapeutic targets involved in neurodevelopmental disorders associated with altered synapse number and connectivity. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > MicroRNA, Dendritic spine density, Synapse structure & plasticity, Neurogenesis, Mouse model < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Research organism: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Human, Rat < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Neurons communicate via specialized structures called spines – protrusions made up mainly of actin filaments which protrude out onto dendrites where excitatory connections form. Spines contain receptors responsible for receiving information about what was previously perceived elsewhere inside the cell - so it ’ s important not only to build them correctly before birth, but also after birth if there were any defects later in childhood — especially since many neurological diseases affect children more than adults. For example autism spectrum disorder affects approximately two percent of people under age three years old while Alzheimer's disease afflicts roughly five million Americans every year. However, little is known regarding exactly why some individuals develop certain conditions compared to others who do not.One way researchers could address questions like this would be to genetically manipulate animals instead of studying human patients themselves because animal models allow scientists to test hypotheses without having too much trouble working around real humans. Researchers already used mice carrying mutations similar to ones seen in autistic babies to try to understand whether genes play crucial parts earlier rather then late in development.The experiments showed that knocking down just one particular type of mutation caused problems sooner rather than later indicating something very basic happens quickly once things get wrong even though no symptoms may yet appear until sometime afterwards. It will take further studies however to determine precisely how abnormal behaviors arise due to faulty communication among nerve cells.To investigate possible causes behind defective communications amongst nerves I wanted to use another technique based on artificially blocking other types of molecules present outside living organisms. These ‘ sponges' bind back unwanted proteins away preventing normal functioning thereby mimicking natural mutants created naturally bychance errors occurring during DNA replication processes. By adding artificial spongescontaining RNA sequences designed specifically against various kinds of protein coding mRNAs, researchers hoped to see better results mirroring mutant animals.But unfortunately none worked successfully enough to make clear conclusions beyond hinting at interesting possibilities going forward. Further investigation might help find ways to prevent harmful interactions taking place prior to birth.This experiment opens avenues for future investigations looking deeper into developing brains both normally and abnormally. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > During mammalian central nervous systems ontogenesis billions of newborn postmitotic cortical projection pyramidal neurons undergo dramatic morphological remodeling resulting first in extensive elaboration followed shortly thereafter by pruning of excess neurites thus generating adult circuitry composed primarily of long thin axons terminating predominantly near postsynaptic sites located mostly on small caliber distal apical tufts emanating directly off basal bodies embedded deep below layer V neocortical lamina (Purpuro et al., 2 0 1 3a; Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2 0 0 4a). While significant progress had recently been achieved elucidating cellular determinants regulating axon specification and elongation across species ranging from worms to mammals (Gibson et al., 2 0 1 4b; Kannan et al., 2 0 1 3b; Lefebvre et al., 2 0 1 5b; Sánchez-Camachillo et al., 2 0 1 3; Tylzanowski et al., 2 0 1 6a; Yu et al., 2 0 0 9a) less attention focused efforts directed towards understanding dendrito- and synaptogenesis dynamics postnatally leaving open several fundamental unanswered issues related to precise timing windows governing structural transitions required for circuit assembly following initial establishment of axodendritic polarity (Marin-Burgin and Mosevitsky, 2 0 1 5a; Petanjek et al., 2 0 1 7a; Yoshihara et al., 2 0 1 7b). Recent advances suggest that timely orchestration of cytoskeletal rearrangements driving neurite outgrowth requires tight spatial coordination orchestrated temporally preceding final arbor refinement steps necessary for establishing appropriate numbers and patterns of presynaptic inputs converging onto nascent
