-like organization for action selection within any animal kingdom or behavior class. Our results suggest general mechanisms by which animals organize complex behaviors using simple rules: suppressing competing actions until they can be executed sequentially without interference from previous ones. ▃ ▃ ▃ SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT ▃ How do organisms select among many possible options when choosing between them based on limited information about what is best suited as well as where it will happen (e.g. food location)? In order to accomplish such tasks efficiently, brains must use flexible strategies involving multiple levels of control over behavioral output. Here I show evidence suggesting specific ways in which Drosophila melanogaster execute coordinated patterns of motion during courtship rituals called "grabs." These include hierarchically ordered suppressive interactions across successive steps along each step cycle so that only certain combinations remain active at all times while others become suppressed depending upon whether other components have already been performed earlier. The resulting orderly progression allows efficient coordination despite incomplete knowledge regarding task goals. Such schemes may also apply more generally than just mating / feeding contexts because similar processes could underlie voluntary acts requiring precise timing including speech production and eye gaze stabilization. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
