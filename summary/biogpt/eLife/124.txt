 effector / terminal effectors in lymphoid organs but not non-hematopoietic tissues such as lung or liver where they remain impaired for months after resolution of inflammation despite restoration of naïve phenotype within 1 week post-injury. This study provides evidence supporting an important role played by persistent dysfunction among tissue resident lymphocytes persisting beyond initial insult which may contribute significantly towards increased morbidity seen at later stages of disease progression when adaptive responses have recovered. These data also suggest potential therapeutic targets aimed toward restoring function across multiple lymphocyte subsets including both circulating peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and organ infiltrating populations critical for host defense against secondary infections. Further studies will be needed to determine whether targeting mechanisms underlying persistence could improve outcomes through enhanced protection afforded via vaccination strategies designed specifically targeted to combat recurrent bacterial challenge while minimizing risk of opportunistic viral reactivation events common amongst survivors who develop prolonged immunosuppression. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
