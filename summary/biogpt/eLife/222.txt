 transport contribute significantly towards pathogenesis for patients suffering from mutations affecting its function. This article has implications beyond human health: it suggests new ways forward by considering membrane trafficking pathways when studying diseases caused by genetic alterations or drug treatments targeting them. The authors also suggest caution should be taken before interpreting data obtained using siRNA knockdown approaches because they can lead to misleading conclusions about protein functions if not properly controlled (see comment below). Finally, although our study focuses specifically upon one disorder where there appears to be no obvious link between defective vesicle recycling / exocytosis at synapses and pathology - X linked mental retardation due to mutation of VPS1 3B encoding Synaptobrevin 2 1 0 3 – other disorders might share similar mechanisms involving impaired synaptic transmission; indeed many neurological conditions involve altered neurotransmission including Alzheimer ’ s Disease 9 8, Parkinson ’ s Diseases 7 6, Autism Spectrum Disorders 4 9, Schizophrenia ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ ▃ < RESULT > < FREETEXT > Results ▃ Patient cell lines display reduced transferrin uptake compared to controls. We first examined whether primary fibroblast cultures derived from two unrelated individuals diagnosed clinically with Lowe Syndrome exhibited any abnormalities consistent with those observed previously following transient transfection of siRNAs against endogenous OCRL1 In order to confirm further that both affected males were carrying pathogenic variants within OCRLl gene exons, genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples collected into EDTA tubes prior to biopsy collection. PCR amplification across all coding regions followed by Sanger sequencing revealed compound heterozygous missense changes predicted to affect splicing [c.1 1 1G > A p. (Glu3 7Lys)] together with nonsense change c.2 0 6C > T p.Arg6 9Ter respectively For comparison purposes, control male foreskin dermal fibroblasts (HFDs) isolated under identical culture protocols but without history of congenital anomalies were used alongside three additional independent HDF strains sourced commercially. As shown in Fig. To determine more precisely what aspect of receptor internalization had become compromised in patient versus normal skin fibroblasts, live imaging experiments employing fluorescently labelled Transferrin ligand binding assays showed significant differences in steady state levels of surface bound fluorescent Tf ligands amongst different genotypes tested (Supplementary Figure Next generation RNA Sequencing reveals global transcriptional dysregulation in Lowe Syndrome patient cells. mRNA expression profiles generated via next generation Illumina HiSeq paired-ended reads analysis identified over fifty genes whose transcript abundance differed statistically significantly among groups analysed here (P value ≤.0 5 after Benjamini Hochberg correction -BH adjusted t test). Of particular interest were transcripts corresponding to CLTC itself being upregulated approximately twofold relative to wild type HFs whereas SNX1 4A appeared downregulated almost threefold suggesting potential compensatory effects occurring during development despite apparent absence of overt developmental phenotype in some cases. Interestingly several members of Rab family GTPases involved in regulating early endosome dynamics displayed differential regulation patterns indicating possible perturbations along endosomal maturation pathway leading up to lysosomal degradation events. Among others RAB1 1B, RAB5A, Rab5B, Rab1 1A and Rab2 2A appear down regulated while Rab7 shows increased transcription level. Other differentially expressed proteins include regulators of cytoskeletal organization e.g. ACTN1, CAPZB, MYH9, MYO1E, TUBB2B etc. Several factors implicated in vesicular fusion processes like VAMP3, SNAP2 5b etc. demonstrated elevated transcript abundances whilst SYT1 7A, STXBP2, SYNTAX3, RIMS1 & SNAP-2 5a fell slightly above significance threshold values though still well outside background noise range. Notably however, neither AP1M1 nor VPS3 3A mRNAs changed appreciably implying unaltered AP-1- dependent cargo selection process. Gene ontology enrichment analyses performed independently through DAVID Bioinformatics Resources tool indicated multiple biological categories related mainly to cellular metabolism, cytoskeleton organisation, signal transduction activities and nucleic acid processing showing statistical association with up- or downregulation of specific sets of target RNAs detected herein (Table Given previous reports implicating Clathrin heavy chain in controlling EGF Receptor signalling Our observation regarding decreased TfR internalisation prompted us to examine EGFR localisation pattern since constitutive activation of downstream MAPK cascade occurs frequently in cancer Cells lacking functional Ocrl1 accumulate large numbers of enlarged perinuclear endosomes containing internalized cargoes typically destined either back out onto plasma membranes or targeted toward lysosomes for destruction. Indeed examination of HeLa cells transiently transfected with GFP tagged constructs expressing full length wildtype mouse OCRL1 fused C terminal tail domain reveal marked co localization with EEA1 positive structures confirming earlier observations made elsewhere Using confocal microscopy we confirmed presence of abnormally sized punctate staining representing accumulated Rab5 + ve compartments colocalizing strongly with endocytosed Alexa Fluor ® -5 9 4conjugated Tfn molecules in mutant MEFs (Figs 4a, b). Such abnormal accumulations could represent aberrant formation of CCVs resulting from perturbed recruitment of key regulatory machinery required for efficient budding off nascent carriers from donor organelles. Consistent with this possibility, quantitative image based measurements carried out throughout entire volume occupied by individual puncta clearly demonstrate higher number per unit area than seen in WT counterparts (Fig. Since depletion studies suggested involvement of Snx9 in mediating interactions between Oculocerebrorenal syndromes causing mutants and AP2 complex Components It would therefore seem likely that interaction partners shared between AP1 complexes and OCRL will play important roles in determining phenotypic outcome arising from disruption of each respective system alone or combined. However given evidence presented recently demonstrating
