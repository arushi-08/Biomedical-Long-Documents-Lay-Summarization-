 is an interactive tool designed by scientists who have studied TF interactions using live cell imaging techniques; it provides insight into mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation through visualization of dynamic processes within individual molecules interacting over time both inside nuclei and between them outside nuclear membranes. © 2 0 1 8 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry Part A: Annual Meeting & Exhibition, San Francisco CA USA, 9 – 1 3 October 2 0 1 7.

In addition to their role during development when genes must respond rapidly enough to environmental cues such as hormones, growth signals, nutrients etc., many studies suggest important roles also later in life including aging and disease states like cancer [e.g. Ref.. For example, mutations affecting SOX2 cause anophthalmia syndrome while those involving OCT4 lead to infertility disorders due to failure of embryonic stem cell- totipotent embryo transition. Understanding what determines whether particular sets of target promoters will become active versus inactive requires knowledge about all aspects involved — namely, sequence specificity via recognition motifs embedded throughout promoter regions, recruitment kinetics based upon diffusion rates across chromatin surfaces, conformational changes induced after initial contact formation leading up to stable complex nucleation events, dissociation dynamics once formed followed by reassociation elsewhere, and finally kinetic competition among different targets resulting in competitive inhibition if one site becomes occupied more than others. These various steps require detailed information beyond simple binary “ON ” vs." OFF "responses since multiple parameters contribute simultaneously making interpretation difficult even without knowing each parameter individually precisely. Furthermore, some properties cannot easily be measured directly because there exists no unique way to do so experimentally except indirectly though mathematical modeling approaches relying heavily on computer simulations often help us understand our intuition regarding system behavior qualitatively given limited experimental observations available today. As part of efforts toward understanding systems level behaviors governing cellular function better tools need to emerge capable of providing direct measurements related specifically to key mechanistic questions posed above. Such new technologies would allow researchers access to additional insights otherwise unavailable thereby enabling deeper biological inquiry. We describe here experiments performed recently utilizing high resolution optical tweezers combined with fluorescent labeling strategies together allowing simultaneous measurement of two critical features associated closely linked mechanistically i.e., relative position occupancy times spent bound near any locus being investigated and dwell times remaining unbound before dissociating back out again prior reaching another location nearby. Our results reveal surprising complexities arising naturally owing largely to energetic considerations alone thus challenging current models describing multi step biomolecular reactions occurring concurrently on long timescales typically required for biologically significant functions. Moreover, recent advances now make possible real world applications requiring quantification of large numbers of biomolecules per experiment opening exciting opportunities for future work exploring fundamental principles behind biochemical pathways operating dynamically in vivo. Finally, although most previous reports focus primarily on measuring forces exerted onto nucleic acids pulling apart double stranded segments separated spatially far apart then tracking subsequent unzipping motions until complete separation occurs, force spectroscopy allows extension lengths down to ∼ 1nm becoming accessible routinely thanks to improved instrumentation design coupled with advanced software algorithms developed particularly well suited for analyzing very small length scale movements observed optically. Thus, combining powerful methodologies described herein should enable further progress towards answering basic science problems concerning functional genomics relating especially to higher organisms whose genome sizes exceed human exome size several fold suggesting much greater potential diversity yet still poorly understood compared to simpler model eukaryotes used extensively currently despite having smaller proteomes overall. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > To investigate spatial distributions around chromosomal locations probed locally by means other than mechanical stretching, fluorescently labeled recombinant mouse Oct4A tagged N terminally with eGFP fused C terminal to its homeodomain domain (mGFP-hOct-4AD) expressed transiently transfected into HeLa Kyoto cells grown adherently on coverslips coated overnight with fibronectin solution diluted appropriately according to manufacturer instructions. Cells expressing low levels of fusion construct showed diffuse distribution patterns consistent with free movement freely diffusing species whereas brighter fluorescing foci appeared localized predominantly close to DAPI stained heterochromatin areas indicating preferential localization closer to chromocenters known to contain highly compacted repetitive sequences rich in AT base pairs similar to typical mammalian satellite repeats located adjacent to centromeres containing GC basepair enriched domains called telomeres shown schematically below Figure 1A.
