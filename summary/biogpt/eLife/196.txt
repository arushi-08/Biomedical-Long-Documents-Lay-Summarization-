 plasmid (ChR2) -EYFP expression vector resulted into robust recruitment of local network activity as well as enhanced gamma frequency oscillation amplitude recorded from medial PFC layer V cells during ongoing behavior. These results suggest functional segregation between distinct regions along the septotemporal axis even before puberty onset which may underlie differential developmental trajectories across brain areas involved in cognition. ▃ ▃ ▃ SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT ▃ Early development supports efficient information processing through coordinated neural communication among different cortical structures including those implicated in memory formation such as anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG; also known as prelimbic region [PL]) and infralimbic division of ventromedial frontal cortices (IL). However, little attention has focused on understanding whether there exist differences regarding connectivity patterns throughout ontogeny when considering both anatomical structure organization and function. Using optogenetics combined with electrophysiology recordings, here we demonstrate preferential targeting of adult rat mPFC layers 5 – 6 projecting axons originating predominantly from CA3 subfield of dentate granule cell zone toward more rostral parts of limbic system where they form extensive synaptic contacts onto parvalbumin interneurons expressing cholecystokinin peptide hormone. Our data indicate strong influence exerted over developing rodent brains already shortly after birth suggesting possible role played by specific connections formed postnatally upon maturation leading ultimately towards mature circuitry capable of supporting higher order functions like learning and decision making later in adulthood.
