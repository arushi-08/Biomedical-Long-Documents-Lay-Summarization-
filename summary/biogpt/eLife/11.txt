This process can be modeled using engineered systems such as organoids derived by directed differentiation; however, it remains challenging to recapitulate all aspects of tissue morphogenesis because many developmental processes occur at much smaller length scale than those accessible through organoid culture techniques. Here we describe our approach toward modeling morphogenetic dynamics via targeted perturbation experiments performed directly inside living 3D cultures generated entirely out of hiPSCs without any intervening steps involving lineage tracing. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats – based genome editing technology combined with live imaging analysis enabled us to induce genetic mosaicism throughout individual iPSC colony units simultaneously allowing direct observation of emergent phenotypic changes associated with perturbations occurring only among subsets of genetically identical but phenotypically heterogeneous cells. shRNA constructs targeting genes encoding proteins involved in regulating cytoskeletal contractility were used here since previous studies have shown them capable of inducing robust morphological phenotypes when expressed mosaically amongst otherwise isogenic wild-type iPSCs cultured under standard conditions []. In addition, shRNAs against two other key molecules implicated previously in neural tube closure defects including Rho kinase I (ROCK) and E cadherin also showed strong evidence supporting roles played by each protein specifically in mediating normal morphology formation in developing brain regions comprising neuroepithelial progenitors undergoing neurulation — i.e. neuroepithelium expansion along rostrocaudal axis. These results demonstrate feasibility of generating functional models recapitulating some features characteristic of early embryonic organogenesis simply though manipulation of single nucleotide polymorphisms present naturally between individuals rather than requiring introduction into target loci prior to reprogramming. Furthermore, given recent advances enabling efficient generation of patient-matched mutant lines harboring disease causing mutations will enable future investigations aimed towards understanding mechanisms underlying pathogenesis caused by rare variants identified recently in patients suffering neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus far most efforts focused upon studying pathogenic consequences resulting solely from loss of function alleles whereas gain of functions remain largely unexplored despite being increasingly recognized contributors to various diseases ranging from cancer progression to autism spectrum disorder []. By combining inducible RNA silencing approaches described herein together with emerging technologies facilitating rapid production of large numbers of clonal mutants carrying defined point mutation combinations desired experimentally, one may envision creation of novel experimental platforms providing unprecedented opportunities not available thus far.Further work should focus primarily on characterizing potential contributions made by both loss- and gain- offunctionsvariant classes which could help elucidate mechanistic underpinnings leading up toonset of certain pathologies arising fromdiverse causes like schizophrenia andAlzheimer's Disease where significant contribution has been attributed bynumerous common risk factors yet few causative mutations.Finally, although presented data demonstrates proof of principle regarding utility of CRISPRi mediated suppression strategy employed insitu to study role of candidate signaling pathways governing mammalian embryogenesis, further optimization would likely improve its efficiency considerably thereby making possible systematic interrogation of entire transcriptome network controlling fundamental biological phenomena related to embryo development.This method offers several advantages compared withexisting strategies relying onex vivo manipulations followed by transplantation of modified embryos onto host animals before fixation forsubsequent histological analyses.. First, unlike conventional transgenic mouse strains expressing fluorescent reporter transgenes whose activity cannot easily trackedowing to high levels of background fluorescence exhibited even after Cre recombinase activation, lentiviral vectors allow simultaneous monitoring of transduced cellsand transgene expressionthroughconstitutive promoters driving GFP reporters. Second, use of lentivirus allows simple transduction procedures yielding relatively uniform infection rates regardless whether applied individually orrepetitively betweenhiPSCs. Third, viral delivery enables stable integration of exogenous DNA sequences conferring permanent modification wherever applicable. Fourth, virus particles do not require specialized equipment required for microinjection hence no special training whatsoever needs to be taken care regardinghandling viruses. Fifth, virally delivered RNAi does not affect viability nor proliferation rate of infected cells so long term maintenance of pluripotency was maintained following transduction.The latter feature makes feasible longitudinal tracking of fate specification trajectories initiated stochastically around time points corresponding to particular stages of gastrulation wherein dynamic pattern forming activities take place concurrently with major transitions occurringascrispreferenceing germ layers commitment eventsin vivo.Overall, taking advantage of inherent properties offered by lentiviruses provides unique opportunity to perform comprehensive screens designed to identify essential components responsible for orchestrating spatiotemporal regulation of crucial physiological processesguiding vertebrate embryogenesis.Moreover, similar tools developed earlier might prove useful for performing forward genetics screen aiming identification of new players contributing to etiology of congenital malformations affecting humanhealth.Taken altogether, demonstration reported hereinetay showcases versatility provided by synthetic biology toolset permitting facile implementation of combinatorial knockoutprotocols suitable for investigating spatio temporal relationships dictating establishment of proper body plan during animal ontogensis. Such knowledge gained shall facilitate better design of therapeutic interventions addressing pathological states characterized by abnormal organ size ratios often encountered clinically today. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Authors thank Dr. Jeremy Nathans for sharing reagents necessary for establishing iPSc line H1 OCT4
