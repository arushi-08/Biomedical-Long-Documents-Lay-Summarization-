Their structural versatility makes them attractive targets for engineering purposes but also presents challenges when designing proteins de novo using computational methods alone. We present evidence suggesting that such design may require careful consideration given our finding that even small changes at key positions could lead to unanticipated outcomes. In particular, it appears unlikely that any designed sequence will adopt exactly what would appear like its native state under physiological conditions because there must exist some mechanism whereby sequences containing destabilizing substitutions remain folded while maintaining specificity towards binding partners. A detailed knowledge about folding pathways should help guide future efforts toward rational redesigns based on existing structures rather than random mutagenesis approaches where off target interactions might occur unpredictably due simply to lack of appropriate selection criteria during library construction. Finally, although many studies report successful attempts to engineer helical bundles through directed evolution strategies involving libraries generated via error prone PCR followed by screening techniques, none use natural variation across multiple species nor explore large numbers of variants simultaneously. It remains unclear whether evolutionary pressure exists against specific amino acid types throughout nature despite being highly conserved among homologues. If so then perhaps more effective ways need to emerge if artificial selections schemes were ever going to succeed without resorting solely to high throughput screens. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Protein expression constructs encoding GCN4 leucine zipper mutants fused N terminal to maltose binding domain (MBP) lacking signal peptide coding region was cloned between NcoI and XhoI sites downstream of T7 promoter in pET2 8a vector (Novagen Inc.
