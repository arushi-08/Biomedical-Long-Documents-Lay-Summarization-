 ensures efficient establishment of centromeric cohesion during S phase by ensuring sufficient levels of loaded cohesins near kinetochores before mitosis onset. This work provides insight into mechanisms underlying human diseases caused by mutations affecting either one or both subunits of mammalian orthologs: Cornelia de Lange syndrome type I due to loss-of- function mutation inNipped B homolog 1; Roberts Syndrome resulting from defective SMC1 gene product. Our results also suggest potential therapeutic targets against cancer cells with high proliferation rates such as those found in leukemia patients who have poor prognosis after chemotherapy treatment. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Cohesin complexes, Chromosome Segregation, Centromeres, Development disorders, Protein interactions, Structural biology < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > In eukaryotes, chromosomes must be faithfully segregated each time they replicate prior to cytokinesis so daughter nuclei receive equal amounts of genetic material upon mitotic exit []. Errors can lead not only directly but more often indirectly through aneuploidy generation — where normal numbers of whole sets of duplicated genes segregate randomly among two progeny cells- causing birth abnormalities including Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome, Patau's syndrome--all associated frequently with mental retardation and congenital heart disease respectively. Aneuploidy has been linked further specifically tocancers because it allows tumor progression while increasing resistance towards apoptosis induced via chemotherapeutic agents used routinely in clinical practice. Thus understanding basic principles governing accurate chromosomal inheritance will help us understand many aspects related to development errors and tumorigenesis. One key mechanism controlling faithful transmission of eukaryotic genomes relies on physical association mediated primarily though protein assemblies called “condensins ” whose activity promotes compaction along chromatin fibers thereby facilitating proper alignment of paired homologous DNAs within metaphase plates formed following nuclear envelope breakdown when spindle microtubules attach them properly to opposite poles – thus allowing correct bipolar attachment of segregating homologs toward opposing ends of dividing spindles.. Condensins consist mainly of structural maintenance of chromosomes3 proteins SMC1A & 3B forming heterodimers joined head domain pairs bound non covalently to regulatory coiled coil domains containing kleisin subunit 2A (RAD2 1L).Together condensin II forms large multimeric rings encircling double stranded circular genomic DNA.They play important roles throughout interphase promoting higher order folding events like formation of topologically associating regions (TIRs) around looped out segments of nascent RNA transcripts generated bytranscription factories located inside nucleoli.The precise nature of topological associations established betweenSMC heads remains unclear although recent studies indicate involvement of transient single strand opening followed by reannealing rather than stable entrapment of nucleic acids. Once assembled, however, SMCs remain stably attached even under conditions destabilizing intermolecular disulfide bonds suggesting tight binding mechanisms.How then do individual catenanes become resolved once pairing occurs without compromising overall integrity of folded structures? A major player involved appears to be topoisomerase IIα enzyme responsible fordecatenation reactions converting intertwined sisters ’ strands back open andready releaseable if needed later only.This process requires ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by ATPase sites contained within N terminal globular domainsof Smc proteins. smc3 mutants deficient in nucleotide bindingexhibit reduced ability to resolve interlockings indicating importance of functional ATPases in resolving linkages involving multiple individualmolecules simultaneously.While there may well exist other factors capable of catalyzing similar activities, evidence suggests that separase protease plays critical roles.However, since most experiments were performed using purified components lacking endogenous regulators, whether additional players might contribute was unknown. Indeed several lines of investigation point strongly that--in addition to topoisomerases IIα--the evolutionarily ancient multi component ‘ REC8 family complex` consisting of Rec8 plus three accessory members SA1, SA2 orSA3 contributes significantly to resolution processes especially regarding centromere biorientation wherein tension forces exerted by pulling microtubule attachments stabilize kinetochore fiber connections made withpericentric heterochromatin marked by histone H3 variant CENP-A. Recent elegant biochemical reconstitutionist approaches revealed direct participation of vertebrate Rae1in mediating release of securin form Separase.Interestingly depletion of any member leads to failure of bi orientationimplying central involvementsin regulating timely dissolution of inter twining links connecting separated sister CENP.-coated kinetochores.It should be noted again that unlike prokaryotes, metazoans lack canonical bacterial counterparts encoding enzymes known to mediate removal of covalent cross linking elements joining adjacent replicons whereas bacteria encode highly specialized machineries dedicated exclusively to removing nicks created enzymically by restriction endonucleases recognizing specific sequences unique to prokaryotic genomes.Therefore despite having evolved distinct strategies based largely on different types of enzymatic machinery employed individually or cooperatively, eukaryote species share common features concerning fundamental steps guiding successful completion of replication dependent partitioning cycles culminating ultimately in complete disjunction of separating sister chromatids. Among others, initial condensation step promoted by condensin seems crucial for subsequent recognition and stabilization of appropriate contacts achieved by dynamic juxtaposition facilitated by regulated remodeling functions provided by various remodelers belonging mostly to families SWI / SNF, Imitator etc. acting locally over short distances surrounding nucleosome cores defining local architecture of condensed nucleosmes. Such organization facilitates rapid access
