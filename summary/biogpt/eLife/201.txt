 during early stages but becomes dispensable later on as fish mature into adults; however, it remains possible that other factors may contribute more strongly than AMPAR-mediated excitation alone toward triggering spontaneous activity patterns observed here. Our results suggest an important role played by excitatory inputs onto PCs beyond their well known inhibitory action via GABAergic synapses: they can initiate burst discharges similar to those triggered directly through NMDARs upon hyperpolarization. These observations have implications both physiologically and pathophyiologically because such mechanisms might be involved in generating pathological states associated with PC dysfunction including ataxia syndromes where abnormal spike discharge has been implicated recently [1 – 3]. We propose that future studies should consider whether therapeutic interventions aimed specifically towards restoring normal synaptic input dynamics will help restore proper circuit operation even if underlying molecular defects remain unknown. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > cerebellum, behavior, development, electrophysiology, network modeling < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Cerebellar granule cells receive glutamatergic mossy fiber afferents while projecting axons form parallel fibres which synapse exclusively onto dendritic spines located along proximal dendrites of Golgi interneurons within the granular layer. Parallel fibre stimulation evokes fast EPSCs followed rapidly after ∼ 2 0 ms by slow IPSCs reflecting spillover release GABA acting primarily presynaptically across multiple receptors clustered around each spine head. By contrast, stellate cell axon terminals contact distal spiny branchlets near soma resulting in large amplitude GABAA receptor currents evoked following single stimuli applied over several hundred milliseconds lasting up totens of seconds. Thus, although there appears little difference between postsynaptic responses elicited either synaptically using glutamate released endogenously or exogenously applying exogenous agonists like kainate, differences exist regarding presynaptic inhibition involving different types of interneuron subtypes depending on location relative to target somata. For example, basket cell feedback inhibits neighboring GCs whereas dendrite targeting stellate cells inhibit distant GC somas thereby controlling spatial spread of information flow throughout the entire cortex. Furthermore, recent work suggests differential roles among various classes of Bergmann glia based on morphology rather then functional properties suggesting additional complexity exists relating to regulation of neuronal excitability. Despite extensive anatomical characterization of all major components comprising circuits mediating output signals originating from the vertebrate hindbrain nuclei, relatively few physiological recordings examining intrinsic electrical characteristics of individual elements constituting them had previously occurred outside acute slice preparations obtained acutely post mortem. However, our understanding about basic cellular physiology governing signal processing downstream of sensory integration continues to evolve due largely to advances made utilizing techniques developed since first described nearly 4 5 years ago wherein intracellular sharp electrodes coupled with extracellular field electrode arrays allowed simultaneous monitoring of subthreshold fluctuations occurring simultaneously amongst many populations of interconnected neural units without disrupting circuitry integrity. Such approaches revealed novel features concerning temporal summation whereby repetitive afferent volleys summate sublinearly before reaching threshold leading ultimately to AP generation. This phenomenon termed “short term potentiation ” occurs widely ranging from invertebrate ganglia containing only two identifiable electrically excitable principal ganglion cells to mammalian cortical networks comprised predominantly of pyramidal projection neurons receiving convergent thalamic drive activating numerous local recurrent collaterals making use of AMPA type ionotropic GluRs expressed abundantly therein. Similarly, voltage clamp experiments performed shortly thereafter demonstrated robust expression of NMDA subtype GluR channels responsible for long duration depolarizations resembling plateau events thought critical for induction of LTP phenomena also found widespread in hippocampal CA1 region though lacking counterparts elsewhere in brain tissue. Although much less studied compared to somatic ionic conductances regulating resting levels of transmembrane voltages, axonal ion channel kinetics play key regulatory functions influencing propagation speed particularly evident in myelinated nerve tracts e.g. optic nerves whose conduction velocity varies considerably according to developmental stage being fastest just prior birth until postnatal day 7 whereupon values decline precipitously so remaining low till adulthood despite continued myelination process continuing postnatally. Axonal Na + -Ca 2 + exchanger proteins present prominently in nodes allowing rapid removal of excess cytosolic calcium ions thus helping maintain appropriate steady state concentrations necessary for maintenance of nodal structure essential for saltatory impulse transmission. Interestingly, some reports indicate presence of persistent sodium conductance persisting far longer times post- stimulus onset perhaps indicating involvement of non inactivating TTX sensitive Nav isoforms distinct from Nav1. 6 typically localized preferentially at node initial segments. Finally, potassium leak rectifying K + channels encoded mainly by KCNQ genes appear capable of modulating overall level of background inward depolarizing influence exerted by electrogenic pumps maintaining stable RMP close to − 8 0mV enabling precise control needed for reliable signaling capabilities exhibited especially prominent in auditory pathways. Together together, evidence indicates complex interplay existing betwen pre- versus postsynaptic sites contributing significantly to shaping spatiotemporal patterning inherent in nervous system outputs arising out of brainstem centers responding appropriately to incoming environmental cues. Given its importance for higher order cognitive processes requiring fine tuning capability afforded by highly organized spatio-temporally patterned activities generated locally within specific regions of cerebral cortices, detailed knowledge pertaining to biophysical parameters defining electrophysiological behaviors displayed by constituent constituents forming circuitries engaged in sensorimotor transformations must continue to grow. Indeed, emerging data supports significant contribution provided by dynamic interactions taking place between diverse sets of functionally specialized yet intermingled subpopulations residing spatially segregated areas participating collectively in computation carried out centrally by virtue of shared common structural substrates
