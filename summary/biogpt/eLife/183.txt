Here, using two complementary approaches - pharmacological blockade or genetically encoded sensors -our results reveal dynamic shifts from one form of network behavior [i.e., spontaneous electrical oscillations called "wave ” bursts] into another type with distinct cellular mechanisms underlying each mode of bursting. Specifically, nicotinic receptors drive both forms while metabotropic ACh receptors regulate only those associated with slow propagating events such as sleep spindles. In contrast, NMDA receptors control fast propagation but not initiation of all waves suggesting they may be involved primarily in signal amplification rather than initial burst generation per se. Our study provides new insights on developmental plasticity mediated through chemical neurotransmission involving multiple neurotransmitters acting via diverse molecular targets expressed throughout nervous system circuitry. These data also suggest novel therapeutic strategies targeting specific components of complex neuromodulatory systems operating under normal physiological conditions can have unexpected effects when applied therapeutically after injury due to disease progression. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
