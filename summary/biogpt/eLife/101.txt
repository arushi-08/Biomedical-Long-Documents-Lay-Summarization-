 cells allows us to measure their influence on other nearby excitatory pyramidal (Pyr) interneurons by measuring changes in calcium concentration within presynaptic terminals as they release neurotransmitter onto postsynaptic targets 1 0 3 – 1 2 4. This approach enables one to study both local microcircuitry between synaptically connected pairs of principal cortical projection neurons and long range interactions across multiple layers through which information flows from subcortical structures such as thalamus and basal ganglia via corticostriatal projections back down toward cortex 5 9, 6 7, 8 0, 1 2 5 - 1 2 7. In addition to providing insight about network dynamics at high spatial scales, optical stimulation also provides an opportunity to investigate mechanisms underlying plasticity during development when synapses form de novo over time while maintaining existing ones; activity dependent synapse elimination occurs throughout life but has been most extensively studied following monocular deprivation where visual inputs become deprived due to eyelid opening early after birth until eye closure restores normal vision 1 2 8. Optogenetic approaches have revealed important insights regarding developmental processes including experience driven synaptogenesis versus homeostatic scaling up / downmodulation depending upon whether new contacts formed result primarily from Hebbian learning rules involving NMDA receptor mediated transmission rather than non-specific increases in spontaneous vesicle fusion events resulting from increased neuronal firing rates alone 1 2 9, 1 3 0. These studies demonstrate potential roles played by different classes of inhibitory interneuron subtypes based not only on location along intracortical pathways but more importantly according to molecular markers expressed selectively either pre- or post-synaptically: parvalbumin expressing fast spiking basket cells located mainly near somata express PV protein presynaptically whereas somatostatin positive Martinotti type interneurones residing mostly deep inside layer V preferentially contact dendritic shafts postsynaptically.The ability to activate subsets of genetically defined populations makes it possible now to explore diverse aspects related to brain structure formation ranging from cellular morphology to behavior. For example, recent work demonstrates selective recruitment of GABAergic axons originating specifically from chandelier class I subtype axo ‐ axonal boutons innervating perisomatic regions of target pyramidal neurons-- “what if ” questions could be addressed experimentally concerning axon targeting specificity and its role in regulating output signals generated locally around each Pyramid's somatic compartment vs. those propagating radially towards distal apical tufts en passant 1 3 1. optogenetics offers unique opportunities here because all components necessary for light delivery must first reach the tissue surface before being delivered directly to targeted sites without significant loss owing to scattering effects inherent in living tissues. Thus far however there remains some concern relating photostimulation efficiency relative to power density emitted per unit area under conditions typically used today compared to earlier reports employing higher intensity laser sources operating closer together thereby increasing excitation volume size. However newer fiber optic designs may help address issues associated with heat dissipation since smaller diameter fibers allow greater penetration depth thus potentially reducing heating effects--although further optimization will likely improve performance even though thermal damage might still occur given longer exposure times required to achieve sufficient levels of illumination needed to excite ChR2 + ve cells--especially considering current limitations imposed by safety regulations governing human use of lasers. It should therefore come no surprise then that efforts continue focused on improving our understanding of basic principles involved in generating complex behaviors like movement control and cognitive processing. One particularly exciting application involves studying motor skill acquisition whereby mice learn novel tasks quickly so enabling them to perform well despite having limited training history prior to testing. Using transgenic animals engineered to conditionally overexpress ChannelrhodopsinII fused to fluorescent proteins, investigators were recently successful in demonstrating rapid induction of robust forelimb movements immediately followed by expression of immediate Early Genes c Fos and Arc indicating involvement of glutamatergic networks mediating sensorimotor integration leading eventually to learned skilled hand reaching skills similar to humans who exhibit similarly acquired dexterity albeit much slower development.While many technical challenges remain ahead researchers hope future applications utilizing genetic tools combined with advanced optics techniques promise great advances allowing scientists access previously unattainable details pertaining to fundamental biological phenomena affecting health and disease states alike. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Highlights < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > New developments offer improved precision and versatility for manipulating mammalian nervous systems < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Genetic manipulation permits fine scale dissection of causal relationships linking gene products to phenotypes < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Novel technologies permit simultaneous measurement of electrical signaling properties & anatomy < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Recent innovations expand capabilities beyond simple binary ON vs OFF switches < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Genetically encoded opsins open doors to investigating functions of small numbers of genes simultaneously < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃
