 fibrotic response in terms of increased α smooth muscle actin expression / deposition with respect to single stimulations alone: our results suggest an important role played also at initial stages during heart failure progression through hypoxic stress modulation on fibroblast phenotype transition toward myofibroblast activation state under low levels of contractile activity. This study provides new insights into mechanisms underlying physiological versus pathologic cell behaviors induced upon specific microenvironment cues; it could be used not just as basic tool but potentially useful for future applications aimed both at understanding disease pathogenesis mechanism and developing novel therapeutic strategies against cardiovascular diseases based on targeting key molecular pathways involved in fibrosis development process. ▃ The online version of this article (1 0. 1 0 3 8 / s4 1 4 7 6-0 1 9-0 5 0 9-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
