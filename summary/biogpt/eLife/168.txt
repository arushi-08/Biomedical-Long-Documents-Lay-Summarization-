 late genes form an "intermediate state 'during neurogenesis when both hunchback- and spatially regulated gene expression is needed for proper differentiation into specific neuron types. This work provides insight on mechanisms underlying cell fate decisions by integrating multiple regulatory inputs at single nucleotide resolution across genomes using targeted DNA adenine methyltransferase identification technology. ▃ ▃ ▃ Editorial note ▃ This article has been through an editorial process in which authors decide how to respond to their comments; see decision letter after author response.
