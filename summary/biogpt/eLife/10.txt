 may be an important mechanism used widely across species as they adapt their nervous systems over time (Figure 2). This process could allow organisms with limited genetic resources such asDrosophila melanogaster andCaenorhabditis elegans to rapidly alter neuronal circuitry through activity-induced localized mRNA transport without requiring de novo transcription. Furthermore, because mRNAs can encode multiple proteins within single cells [4 0 – 5 3] it is possible that some transcripts might serve more specialized functions depending on where themajority localize relative toother target genes. For example, if one transcript encodes components required specifically for presynaptic assembly while another codes primarily postsynaptic structural elements then there would betwo distinct pools ofsynaptically targeted messages available: those encoding pre- versus post-synaptic- specific factors respectively; each pool being regulated independently via different molecular pathways. Thus, although many questions remain unanswered regarding what regulates selective targeting of individual messengers into dendrites following neural activity--including which cis regulatory sequences mediate dendritic localization--and why certain classes of dendritically transported messenger ribonucleoproteins preferentially associate withparticular subsets ofintracellular targets, our results suggest several testable hypotheses about potential roles played bylocally translated products in modulating circuit development and maintenance. Future work will focus upon determining precisely when translational regulation occurs after learning events so that appropriate temporal windows exist whereby manipulations aimed toward disrupting either transcriptional activation alone orboth transcriptionalactivityplus translativeprocesses affect memory consolidation. Finally, given recent evidence suggesting widespread use of microRNAs among mammalian cell types, future experiments should investigate interactions between microRNA processing machinery and ribonucleoprotein complexes involved inlong term potentiation paradigms involving acute electrical stimuli similar theirin vitro models described here. Such investigations promise not just new insights concerning basic cellular biology underlying information storage in higher animals ’ brains, but potentially novel therapeutic strategies designed towards treating neurological disorders associated with aberrant forms of persistent memories. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃
