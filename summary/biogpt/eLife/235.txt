In both cases, adaptive responses require sufficient time for mutation accumulation before being selected against due to deleterious effects associated with further mutational steps required after initial beneficial ones. However, it is unclear whether there exists an optimal timescale between fixation events when considering only neutral versus advantageous outcomes — i.e., which would be most likely given enough opportunity exist within realistic experimental constraints imposed by limited resources available today. This question has important implications not just regarding our understanding of biological processes but also about efforts aimed toward rational design using laboratory experiments where one must consider what fraction of possible sequences will actually evolve successfully while minimizing costs incurred upon experimentation itself. Here, I address two questions related specifically to recent advances made towards answering fundamental aspects concerning the role played by randomness vs. determinism underlying rapid functional divergence among homologous enzymes involved directly in cellular metabolism across animals spanning ∼ 4 billion years ago. First, does “contingency ” play more than simply providing opportunities for subsequent substitution if all other factors remain constant throughout history? Second, do different pathways follow similar patterns despite their shared ancestry? To answer each issue independently, my approach was based entirely on reconstructing ancestors along specific branches connecting extant species followed immediately thereafter by mutagenesis coupled with high throughput screening methods capable of identifying rare variants exhibiting novel functions relative to those present initially. These approaches allowed me systematically sampling entire lineages starting from distinct nodes leading up to modern day organisms without having previously considered potential contingencies inherent in earlier stages of lineage development prior to major transitions involving gene duplication and loss. My results demonstrate conclusively that although some amino acid positions were fixed early following duplications resulting in paralogs encoding highly divergent catalytic activities targeting alternative substrates, others accumulated later replacements conferring additional substrate preferences accompanied simultaneously by significant losses in activity levels compared with contemporary homologs. Moreover, whereas certain residues appeared critical regardless of branch length examined here, several sites exhibited greater importance depending on node position indicating differential rates of replacement occurring subsequently rather than reflecting differences arising exclusively owing to longer periods since branching off. Finally, analysis revealed striking similarities amongst independent paths taken suggesting convergent solutions evolved repeatedly irrespective of phylogenetic distance separating them. Taken together, these data suggest strongly that neither neutrality nor positive Darwinian selection alone explains observed divergences unless accounting explicitly for stochastic fluctuations around particular points representing key intermediates en route to future success. Thus, instead of focusing strictly on deterministic forces operating continuously until reaching ultimate fitness peaks shaped by negative pleiotropy acting late into life ’ s course, consideration should now shift away purely stochastically determined mechanisms dominating short term evolvability prospects so much sooner may arise once conditions permit exploration deeper times past current limits dictated largely by finite resource availability currently limiting progress in biotechnology applications requiring large numbers of molecules produced rapidly yet efficiently. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Although numerous studies examining biochemical properties of individual members belonging to multigene families indicate substantial diversity existing beyond expectations derived merely from simple models describing population genetics theory, little attention had thus far focused on determining why paralogous genes diverge functionally faster than expected assuming strict conservation of function per se. A number of hypotheses including relaxed purifying constraint driving increased nonsynonymous nucleotide polymorphism, relaxation of stabilizing selection allowing higher frequencies of slightly destabilizing missense alleles promoting accelerated turnover rate, neofunctionalization facilitating acquisition of alternate enzymatic capabilities enabling utilization of otherwise unavailable nutrients, sub- sequent increases in recombination frequency favoring formation of hybrid isozymes potentially accelerating diversification, etc., have emerged recently attempting explain apparent discrepancies noted above. Among various possibilities suggested originally by Ohta et al.. who argued that duplicate copies might accumulate less severe inactivating lesions permitting retention of functionality better suited to changing environments encountered relatively frequently, Lynch & Conery proposed that duplicated loci experiencing reduced expression level tend to retain duplicates longer thereby increasing chances of acquiring compensatory regulatory modifications enhancing overall performance capacity. More generally speaking, however, none of these explanations adequately account fully for observations demonstrating widespread occurrence of nonorthologous displacement whereby newly arisen phenotypes appear unrelated orthologs sharing very low similarity scores nonetheless evolving convergently. For example, human cytochrome P4 5 0s exhibit extensive allelic heterogeneity causing interindividual variability affecting metabolic clearance profiles impacting therapeutic efficacy of drugs metabolized extensively by liver cytochromes P4 5 0. Similarly, bacterial β lactamases show considerable promiscuity catalyzing hydrolysis reactions utilizing diverse antibiotics ranging widely varying chemical structures making identification difficult especially outside clinical settings. Furthermore, analyses comparing phylogenies constructed separately employing synonymous vs non ‐ coding regions reveal strikingly poor congruence implying frequent horizontal transfer contributing significantly to phenotypic novelty presumably facilitated by elevated genomic plasticity afforded by mobile
