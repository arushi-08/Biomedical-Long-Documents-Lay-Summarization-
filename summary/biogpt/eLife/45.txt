 if multiple pathways evolve simultaneously within an individual taxon (e.g. grasses); however, once established there may be little room for further innovation unless they occur early during evolution. Our results suggest new avenues towards understanding why some plants acquire their own unique metabolic solutions while others do not despite having similar environmental conditions. They also highlight potential limitations when using phylogenetic approaches alone to understand adaptive radiations such as those involving transitions between different modes of carbon fixation. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > adaptation, convergence, divergence time estimation, phylogenetics, parallel molecular changes, transitional probability matrices < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Convergent morphological innovations can arise repeatedly through independent origins across distantly related taxa following shared selective pressures [1 – 3]. However, convergent phenotypes often result either directly via selection acting upon existing genetic variation present before speciation events occurred or indirectly due to common ecological factors operating over long periods of geological times leading up to diversification [4 – 7]. In contrast, repeated origin of physiological adaptations requires both functional constraints imposed by gene regulatory networks controlling development along specific developmental axes coupled with strong natural selections favouring particular genotypes under certain environments [9 – 2 5]. Physiological novelties arising after duplication followed by neofunctionalization typically involve modification of one function without affecting another resulting in pleiotropic effects which could lead to negative fitness consequences including reduced growth rates and increased susceptibility to extinction compared to single copy genes involved only in primary metabolism [2 6 – 2 8]. Thus far most studies investigating patterns of parallelism among closely related organisms focus primarily on morphology rather than physiology because more detailed information about biochemical mechanisms underpinning organismal performance would require extensive experimental work beyond what researchers currently possess today ’ s technology capabilities. For example, although many examples exist where two sister groups share identical morphologies yet differ substantially regarding key aspects of biochemistry — particularly enzyme kinetics and substrate affinities — few cases demonstrate clear evidence supporting divergent versus convergently evolving metabolisms even though each case represents important biological processes requiring precise regulation [2 9 – 3 1]. A recent study demonstrated substantial differences in protein sequence similarity amongst enzymes responsible for glycolysis suggesting considerable structural diversity exists allowing them to adapt rapidly enough so as to maintain functionality whilst still maintaining overall stability given changing thermal regimes experienced throughout Earth history. These authors argue therefore that studying proteins solely provides limited insight into possible routes available for rapid change since large numbers must accumulate mutations prior to any significant shifts occurring elsewhere in cellular machinery required for optimal functioning. Therefore future investigations should consider whether functionally equivalent paralogues might diverge significantly later simply owing to relaxed purifying selection against deleterious alleles causing loss of expression whereas highly conserved orthologues remain unchanged until mutation occurs subsequently enabling subsequent specialization. It remains unknown precisely how much mutational input was necessary to achieve distinct specializations needed for successful colonization of contrasting habitats. Moreover, identifying all instances whereby homologous loci diverged sufficiently late relative to whole genome duplications thus providing sufficient opportunity for additional modifications cannot easily be achieved empirically especially considering current technological limits preventing high throughput sequencing data collection spanning entire genomes routinely being generated nowadays. Consequently our ability to predict likely scenarios concerning past population dynamics influencing emergence of physiologically specialized clades needs improvement considerably above expectations derived purely from comparative genomics analyses. Finally, determining exactly who acquired its first specialised character state and whom did not- ‘ invention theory '-does pose fundamental challenges facing biologists attempting to explain macroevolutions like radiation bursts observed frequently in nature. Although several models describing microevolutionary forces driving generation of novelty continue to emerge, no consensus appears evident indicating general rules governing pattern formation [3 5 – 3 7]. Nevertheless, knowledge gained here relating to basic principles guiding establishment of evolutionarily stable states offers opportunities to improve predictions made earlier stages of life cycles thereby informing us better about historical contingency contributing toward shaping biodiversity distributions globally. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > One striking illustration illustrating complexity inherent in defining causes behind origination of ecologically essential characters comes from systems exhibiting remarkable plasticity wherein individuals exhibit alternate strategies depending largely on local environment encountered. Examples include switches used by animals foraging away from predators responding appropriately according to prey availability levels and insects developing reproductive structures appropriate to habitat type found locally around nests sites adapted accordingly. Such responses allow populations inhabiting heterogeneous landscapes to maximize reproduction success regardless of location ultimately enhancing chances of survival. Similarly, numerous angiosperm families display extreme variability ranging widely in leaf form reflecting differing degrees of resource capture efficiency linked strongly to light intensity gradients prevalent worldwide. While leaves vary greatly morphologically, anatomical features critical for efficient gas exchange generally appear relatively invariant implying tight control exerted over allocation decisions regulating assimilation capacity irrespective of external cues provided. Despite apparent robustness of stomatal structure and number per unit area exhibited consistently across broad taxonomic scales, variations in mesophyll thickness seem tightly regulated ensuring adequate water supply facilitating CO2 uptake. Furthermore, various combinations of cell types comprising stomata determine maximum conductance values permitting fine tuning of transpiration rate dependent mainly on ambient humidity level prevailing outside canopy gaps created periodically every day by clouds falling
