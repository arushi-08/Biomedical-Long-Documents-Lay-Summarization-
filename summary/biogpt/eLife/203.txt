 sites within minutes after they emerge behind nascent ruffles or protrusions (Fig 1 0). This model explains why many different types of cell surface structure can be formed through macropinocytosis: it requires only one set of proteins for each type but also relies upon common mechanisms such as local activation thresholds rather than specific protein interactions [2 4 – 3 5]. The fact that we observe similar patch organisation across multiple systems suggests that our hypothesis may apply more broadly beyond D. discoideum — although further work will need to test whether other organisms use analogous processes during normal development. Our results suggest new ways forward towards understanding cellular uptake pathways; indeed, future studies should focus specifically on testing if endocytic activity involves similarly patterned signals like those described here. In addition, because some cancers rely heavily on macropinocytosis for nutrient acquisition, targeting key regulators could potentially help treat cancer patients who have developed resistance against drugs blocking receptor tyrosine kinases used upstream of PI3K signaling pathway components. Finally, since most human diseases involve defects affecting fluid transport between tissues via endocytosis, studying signal transduction networks controlling macropinocytosis might shed light onto disease pathogenesis better than focusing solely on individual genes involved directly in vesicle trafficking itself. For example, mutations causing Parkinson ’ s Disease affect Rab GTPases regulating synaptic transmission while having no effect whatsoever on clathrin mediated internalization rates per se. By contrast, loss of PTEN causes increased levels of PI lipids leading both to enhanced phagocytosis and elevated constitutive macropinocytosis due to excessive recruitment of PI3 kinase products to membranes where they activate downstream effectors required for ruffling and fusion events. Thus, identifying patterns underlying spatial organization among molecules known collectively to control mammalian endocytotic activities would likely reveal novel insights about molecular pathology underpinning complex disorders involving abnormal tissue homeostasis. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All strains were grown axonally using HL5 medium supplemented with glucose according standard procedures unless otherwise stated. Cells expressing fluorescent markers under regulation of endogenous promoters were selected either with G4 1 8 sulphate (Sigma Aldrich  A1 7 2 9) or Blasticidin S HCl (Calbiochem  6 3 1 3 1 1) depending on vector size. To induce starvation conditions, exponentially growing cultures were washed twice before plating them out sparsely so single amoebae settled down randomly without forming aggregates prior to starving overnight shaking culture flasks containing phosphate buffer instead of growth media. Expression plasmids encoding GFP fusions driven constitutively by actin1 5C promoter was generated previously. Plasmids carrying inducible expression cassettes were constructed following published protocols. Briefly, coding sequences corresponding to N terminal fragments of PI3K1 & 2 fused C terminally to mRFP1 followed by NLS sequence derived from SV4 0pA gene product were cloned into pDM2U plasmid backbone digested with BglII restriction enzyme site immediately preceding MCS region. A fragment comprising act1 5Cpromotor driving RFP tagged full length PH domain of CRAC together with its own terminator regions flanked by two loxP recombination target sites separated by spacer DNA nucleotides TTCAAGAGA was inserted into EcoRI linearized pDNeo2a plasmid resulting in final construct named “Lox ” -mRFP-PHPLC. Similarly, YFP tagged RBD domains of PhdA expressed under actin5c regulatory elements preceded by loxp recognition motif was subcloned into BamHI restricted pUCBsrΔBam destination vectors. cDNA clones representing entire open reading frames of rasG, pi3k1 & 2, arp3, abcG1, adc, aca, socs1 & 2, pkbA & B, tsc1 0a etc. along with genomic clone covering whole ORF of akaA locus obtained commercially (Open Biosystems cat No MHS1 0 1 0 − 9 2 0 9 4 9Q2) served as templates for PCR amplification reactions performed essentially as recommended by manufacturer except annealing temperature varied slightly dependent on Tm values predicted online tool OligoPerfect Designer software http: / / www.oligoengineering.com / en / custom% 2C + calculator.html.pdf. Amplified cDNAs included complete ORFs plus additional flanking untranslated leader exons identified bioinformatically whenever possible. Primers designed accordingly contained appropriate overhangs allowing ligation independent cloning strategy implemented in Gateway system compatible entry vectors pENTR TM 1A Dual Selection Vector kit purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies Inc.. Entry constructs harbouring desired inserts then underwent LR clonase reaction combined with DH1 0B competent E. coli strain transformation yielding respective recombinant bacmid DNAs suitable for baculovirus production. Recombinant baculoviruses thus produced subsequently transformed Sf9 insect host cultured in SFX ™ Insect Cell Medium supplied with L Glutamine supplement (Gibco ® Catalogue No. 1 × GlutaMAX Supplement Non Essential Amino Acids Solution Cat No.1 0 0X).
