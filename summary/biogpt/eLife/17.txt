 as an open source tool for quantitative analysis of mechano (cyto) logy experiments across multiple scales from single cells down to multicellular structures. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction: ▃ Mechanical forces play important roles during embryonic morphogenesis by regulating processes such as proliferation 1 -migration 2 - differentiation 3 In addition to their role in normal physiology, aberrant mechanotransduction is implicated in diseases including cancer 4 Mechanotransductive signaling pathways have been studied extensively using reductionist models where isolated components can be manipulated independently The most common approach has involved applying external loads directly onto cultured cells To address some limitations associated with existing methods, here we develop new tools based upon traction microscopy techniques which allow us to study mechanically active systems spanning several orders of magnitude between subcellular levels up to whole organs Here, we describe two complementary analytical frameworks designed specifically for studying mechanobiology problems involving large numbers of interacting elements over long time periods. First, we introduce a novel method called "fluctuation correlation spectroscopy" (FCS; see Methods section below) to analyze correlations among local variations in measured stresses generated around each point along any given line segment. This technique allows one to characterize spatial patterns of correlated strain energy density variation throughout entire regions of interest without requiring explicit segmentation of images. Second, we present a statistical framework termed "tensor network flow" (TNF; Fig. Using these toolkits together enables quantification not only of global changes but also fine details about spatio-temporal features underlying complex biological phenomena like collective mechanics. As proof of principle applications, we apply them first to investigate intercellular coupling strength in cohesive epithelia undergoing spontaneous self assembly Our results show strong evidence supporting previous hypotheses regarding regulation of junctional tension via feedback loops controlling myosin II activity Within larger groups of coherently moving cells, however, there appears little coordination beyond nearest neighbor interactions suggesting other factors may contribute more strongly than previously thought. For example, it remains unclear whether contractile events occur preferentially near apical surfaces or basally even though recent work suggests they do Both tensional networks exhibit characteristic length scalesconsistent with those observed experimentally A key advantage offered by these methodologies lies in allowing direct comparison against independent measurements obtained either computationally Alternatively, if available, additional information might include values describing parameters governing actin polymerization rates, cross linking kinetics etc.. While further validation will require testing under different conditions, initial tests suggest good agreement between theory predictions and experiment Overall, while many questions remain unanswered, combining theoretical modeling efforts with high throughput experimentation provides opportunities to advance understanding of fundamental biophysical principles driving emergent properties in living matter. < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ < METHOD > < FREETEXT > Materials & Method: ▃ Cell culture reagents MCF1 0A human mammary gland adenocarcinoma cells expressing GFP tagged Histone 2B protein (H2B-eGFP) Cells grown overnight before imaging were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum, 0. 5μg ml -1 hydrocortisone, 1µg mL − 1 cholera toxin, 2ng mL − 1 EGF, penicillin streptomycin solution containing amphotericin B FungizOne ® antimycotic reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Waltham MA USA Cat  A1 9 8 7 6 0 1) until use. Before seeding cultures, glass coverslips coated with poly L lysine hydrobromide (Sigma Aldrich St. Louis MO USA Catalog number P8 9 2 0MP Lot Number SLBK1 6K6 3YJ) were washed twice with water then incubated sequentially three times with ethanol followed once again with PBS pH = ~ 7. 4 + Ca 2 + Mg 2 + prior being dried completely. Coverslips treated according above were placed inside custom stainless steel chambers filled with growth medium described earlier. Prior to plating cells, PDMS sheets patterned with circular adhesive islands spaced apart by non-adhering areas were attached to coverslip bottoms after plasma treatment. After incubating dishes briefly in room temperature air atmosphere, approximately five million trypsinized cells suspended in fresh media plus supplements mentioned above were added per dish. Dishes were sealed tightly so no bubbles escaped out when imaged immediately following attachment. All live fluorescence confocal image acquisition started just minutes post attaching cells had settled back on top of substrate surface. Imaging used Nikon A1R inverted microscope equipped with motorized stage controlled by NIS Elements software package v4. 4.0 Build 1 5a installed locally. Excitation light came from solid state lasers operating at wavelengths λ ex = 4 0x C Apo NA 1. 2W IR Water immersion objective lens (Olympus America Center Valley PA USA cat No PLAPON VC × WI DIC N2 5XWMP2 6X Oil Immersion Objective Lens). Fluorescence emission passed filters centered at λem = BP 5 0 0nm -5 5 0m LP Dichroic mirror DM DiM HC Filter ID X (Chroma Technology Corp Bellows Falls VT USA Product Code ET DAPI BS XF 4 9HE BL). Images acquired every second consisted of z stacks consisting of ten planes separated by step sizes ranging from 0. 8µm to 1. 7μm depending on sample thickness. Image processing included background subtraction performed manually using ImageJ plugin 'rolling ball radius averaging algorithm' with size parameter set equal to half maximum pixel value. Maximum
