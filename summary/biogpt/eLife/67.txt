 hypothesis but not an alternative "push / pull" or “molecular switch ” mechanisms proposed by others. Finally, using genetic epistasis experiments coupled with quantitative modeling approaches enabled us to identify two novel regulators required downstream from Bmp2b: Sizzled and Tolloid protease inhibitor 1. Together, our results suggest new models underlying vertebrate pattern specification during development where multiple gradients cooperate together at different stages throughout embryogenesis. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > INTRODUCTION ▃ Pattern Formation describes when cells acquire distinct fates within developing tissues via differential gene expression patterning events. In many cases, spatial information must be encoded into diffusible signals whose concentration varies over space due either directly to local production rates or indirectly because they diffuse away from their sources. These diffusing molecules can act locally; however if too much signal diffuses across tissue boundaries then developmental processes such as segmentation will fail. For example, Drosophila Decapentaplegic forms long range extracellular protein gradients that specify dorsal cell fate while short ranges induce ventrolateral mesoderm differentiation. Here, we use high resolution imaging methods to quantify endogenous bone morphogenetic proteins' activities in vivo and combine them with theoretical simulations to determine whether any previously described gradient forming process could explain observed dynamics. First, we show evidence against both transcriptional regulation and negative feedback mediated transport phenomena including receptor trafficking between membrane bound compartments and active sites. Second, although previous studies have suggested positive cooperativity among BMPs may drive graded responses, here we find no experimental indication consistent with cooperative interactions driving early stage embryo patterning. Third, contrary to current dogma, neither classical nor non-canonical Wnt ligands were necessary upstream of BMP2a activation suggesting other factors regulate its localization. Fourth, instead of relying upon passive movement driven by bulk flow effects, we propose a simple yet robust biochemical reaction network involving localized binding followed by enzymatic degradation explains all aspects of dynamic behavior seen experimentally. Fifth, we demonstrate that the secreted factor Squint acts genetically parallel to known modulators of BMP pathway function providing further insight about regulatory pathways controlling gastrulation movements. Sixthly, we establish that Tld functions independently of Dpp proteolysis indicating additional unknown targets exist regulating DV morphogenesis beyond those already identified. Seventh, combining genetics and simulation allowed identification of two genes encoding putative inhibitors of tolloids - szl and tip1l1 -each essential components of the system responsible for generating stable ventralized phenotypes following loss of tll1a + b. Eighteenth, we present direct measurements showing that Tsz binds specifically to BMP4 thus identifying one potential target molecule involved in modulating proteolytic cleavage of Chordinlike. Taken altogether, our study provides strong independent validation of several key predictions made regarding the role played by squint orthologs in establishing opposing concentrations of BMP2 / 4 growth factors leading ultimately to proper body plan organization. Moreover, given recent reports implicating mutations affecting human SOSTDC1 in congenital disorders associated with skeletal abnormalities, This work also demonstrates how integrating single animal level observations with detailed mechanistic knowledge allows precise dissection of complex biological systems without extensive experimentation. While most prior efforts focused solely on analyzing individual mutants has been successful, there remains significant room for improvement especially considering increasing numbers of available genome editing tools allowing more sophisticated interrogation of specific candidate loci. Thus far only three groups used CRISPR technology to delete sog homologs in mice Despite limitations inherent to studying small animals compared to humans, understanding basic principles governing organ size control requires careful consideration of evolutionary conservation. Indeed, even though mammals lack true somitogenesis cycles, similar temporal changes occur repeatedly every ~ 3 0 hours in fish resulting in repeated rounds of somite generation called somites per day. Therefore, insights gained from investigating fundamental questions related to organogenesis should inform future attempts aimed toward treating birth defects caused by abnormal scaling up or down of organs. Furthermore, since some patients exhibit severe malformations despite having normal karyotypes, uncovering conserved roles shared amongst species would help elucidate common disease etiologies. As shown above, comparing mouse knockouts reveals differences in phenotypic severity depending on locus targeted highlighting the importance of examining entire families of homologous genes simultaneously. Similarly, comparative genomics suggests that certain classes of transcription factors play important evolutionarily ancient functional roles whereas others perform specialized tasks unique to particular lineages Further investigation focusing primarily on orthologous pairs might reveal critical nodes linking core cellular networks underpinning various physiological traits. Overall, integration of multi scale datasets obtained under identical conditions represents powerful means towards elucidating general rules guiding multicellular organism biology. Such integrative strategies hold great promise particularly for unraveling intricate relationships operating inside living organisms thereby enabling improved diagnosis and treatment options for diseases arising from aberrant physiology. < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ < METHOD > < FREETEXT > MATERIALS AND METHODS ▃ Zebrafish Maintenance and Embryo Collection.
