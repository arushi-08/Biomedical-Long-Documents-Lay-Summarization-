: The more reliable one's dimension relative to another it becomes; therefore less reliance will be placed upon its use when making decisions about linguistic structure. This may explain why some people who experience difficulty understanding music also find difficulties comprehending natural conversations - both within their own culture but across cultures [1 – 3]. These data suggest an important role played by brain networks involved in auditory scene analysis processes underlying musical abilities outside those required specifically for hearing sounds from complex environments like our everyday lives. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Congenital Amusics show impaired ability compared to normal participants at discriminating pitches based solely on fine spectral detail even though there was no difference found regarding sensitivity thresholds using pure tones presented over headphones. In contrast, performance levels did differ significantly among subjects depending whether stimuli contained temporal information alone versus combined spatial plus time aspects suggesting different strategies used by each listener. For example, while all three normals could discriminate “short ” notes falling into four distinct frequency bands separated by 0% semitones above chance level without any masking noise added, none of them performed well below 7 2% correct under similar conditions except for subject  4 whose mean score reached 8 6 ± 9 percent correctly identified trials out of ten possible choices per stimulus type combination tested here. On average, however, five amutants showed poorer than expected scores indicating greater variability in response patterns despite comparable overall accuracy rates observed amongst individual patients. A recent study reported reduced discrimination skills towards melodic intervals containing fewer harmonics rather than just fundamental frequencies consistent with previous studies showing deficits recognizing familiar songs lacking key features including timbre details due to poor encoding precision along harmonic trajectories. However, unlike earlier work reporting increased error rate associated with missing critical components embedded in sequences composed entirely of random chords, we failed to observe significant effects involving omission errors although most responses fell near zero probability values reflecting lack of knowledge concerning what had been omitted altogether. Instead, many incorrect judgments appeared biased toward misidentifying small changes made either because of large variations around target parameters themselves or simply because of irrelevant contextual factors unrelated directly to tone content itself. Thus, contrary to prior reports describing enhanced susceptibility to acoustic degradation coupled with decreased attention span in persons suffering from developmental disorders affecting central nervous system functions resulting in impairments beyond simple sensory acuity, neither absolute nor categorical sound recognition appears compromised in adults diagnosed with congenital amusia. Rather, abnormal behavior seems primarily attributable to imprecise representation of specific elements comprising meaningful signals leading ultimately to inaccurate categorization given appropriate listening contexts. Such inaccuracies appear particularly pronounced if additional sources of ambiguity exist simultaneously thereby creating situations requiring compensatory mechanisms whereby alternative interpretations can emerge rapidly following initial exposure through selective recruitment of alternate pathways. As noted previously, evidence suggests that certain types of cognitive impairment might arise secondarily after years of life having initially developed normally thus allowing compensation via altered behavioral tactics later in development perhaps explaining apparent discrepancies between early childhood testing outcomes vs. adult functioning. It should further be pointed out that children affected by severe forms of autism spectrum disorder often exhibit behaviors reminiscent of amua syndrome characterized mainly by problems identifying subtle distinctions in environmental events whereas typically developing peers tend to perform better regardless of age range examined. While preliminary analyses revealed few statistically robust correlations linking measures obtained before formal diagnosis with subsequent test performances, future investigations would benefit greatly from larger sample sizes enabling statistical power sufficient enough to detect relationships otherwise obscured owing to low effect size estimates derived from smaller samples studied separately so far. Finally, since the current investigation focused exclusively on native speakers speaking English, generalization needs consideration especially considering cross cultural issues surrounding accent variation influencing perceived speaker identity e.g... < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > To date little effort has gone put forth investigating potential structural correlates responsible for anomalous percepts arising from disrupted cortical organization stemming from genetic mutations causing abnormalities in neuronal migration occurring prenatally throughout fetal stages of human gestation. One notable exception involves focal lesions acquired postnatally disrupting connections connecting primary motor cortex with premotor areas known collectively as Broca ’ s area located anterior to Heschl gyrus bilaterally. Patients afflicted suffer aphasia accompanied frequently by mutism implying disruption of vocal production capabilities necessary for fluent communication. Although several hypotheses attempt to account for symptoms experienced by aphasic populations ranging widely from phonemic parsing defects caused by damage confined largely to posterior superior frontal gyri up until now unknown etiology remains elusive. Interestingly, bilateral lesion sites encompassing inferior parietal lobe structures seem highly correlated with severity of verbal apraxia commonly seen together with agrammatism characteristic of anomic subtypes of aphasia presumably accounting for deficient sequencing capability needed for accurate word retrieval. Moreover, unilateral injury restricted almost completely to Wernicke ’ s Area leads to profound disturbances resembling classical cases described originally by Paul Bloch wherein he suffered sudden onset loss of spontaneous articulation followed weeks afterwards by complete paralysis sparing facial expression yet leaving intact oral sensation rendering him unable to produce words orally. More recently, neuroimaging techniques capable of localizing functionally active neurons reveal considerable overlap existing between anatomical locations corresponding to damaged tissue producing clinical manifestations typical of classic neurological syndromes classically attributed
