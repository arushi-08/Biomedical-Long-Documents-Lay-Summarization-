 is an important drug discovery platform from both chemical biology perspectives - it can be exploited not only through small molecule inhibitors but also via large macrocyclic depsipeptidic scaffolds such as those found within marine organisms like Diplodia macrospora or Aplidium albicans. ▃ Main text: ▃ Natural Products Derived From Marine Organisms Are Potent Inhibitors Of Cancer Cell Growth In Vitro Tannatins A & B were isolated from Caribbean sea hares 1 9 5 3; 2 4] while their structure elucidation remained elusive until recently [e.g. Ref 8]. These compounds exhibit potent cytotoxicity against human tumor cell lines including HeLa cervical carcinoma Cells However, despite extensive study over several decades there has been no clear understanding about themechanism ofaction.To address this gap in knowledge, we synthesized three novel analogues based on our previously reported synthesis strategy For each analogue two diastereomers were prepared using either D / L amino acids or non proteinogenic α hydroxy acid building blocks Scheme Scheme1a Schemes1b Proposed biosynthetic pathway for ternatins.2a Our previous work involved installing N -methyl groups at positions 6 and7 during ring closing metathesis followed by oxidation under basic conditions to afford the desired ketone functionalities. This step introduces chirality into one part of the macrocycle whilst leaving other parts untouched. Subsequent reduction of the resulting ketones afforded diols 6a and 6b respectively. After protecting group manipulation, ester hydrolysis gave carboxylic esters 7a and 7b respectively.3a Synthesis began with coupling commercially available Fmoc protected glycine derivative 8a With compound 9a secured, subsequent amide bond formation between 9b and amine 5a furnished dipeptide intermediate 9c along with free amines 6a.3b Next, removal of benzyl ethers provided diol 9d after treatment with TBAF • 3HF 4.Finally, esterification reactions completed syntheses of all four isomers 4a – 4d. All final molecules 4b − 4e were purified chromatographically before biological testing. As shown below, isomer 4c exhibited significantly enhanced activity compared toany parent congener tested thus providing us insight regarding structurefunction relationships fortennatine's anticancer properties. Furthermore, given recent reports suggesting potential off targettoxicity associated withsome members of thecytostatin family, we sought evidence whichcould suggest whether inhibition of eEF1Amight contribute towards thisphenomenon. Thus, we performed additional experiments aimed wether 4may inhibit eF1A1 functionality.The results show clearly that analog 4c inhibits eEF2 mediated translocation thereby blocking polypeptide chain elongation.This finding suggests further investigation betweenc onjugation factors 1A.2b. Given that most known drugs targeting components of translational machinery act directly upon ribosome subunits rather thanEF1A2, 3c future studies will focus indepth characterization of analogs 4c + d ’ s ability to modulate ribosomal functions. Moreover, since numerous cancers overexpress certain isoforms of EF-1α, 3d selective agents capable of inhibiting particular forms would represent valuable therapeutic leads. ▃ Results and Discussion ▃ Design and preparation of ternastatin derivatives b o e f h i n j g l m k r e t he first generation library Table Compounds 4f and 4g showed significant improvement relative to ternatain when assayed againstA5 4 9cellshowever they did so less effectively than the second generation derivatives. www.nature.com / scientificreport / Interestingly, although neither enantiomer from4h displayed improved activityff ith respect tobutanestrepinine, enantiomers 3f and 3i demonstrated more pronounced inhibitory activities. Although racemic mixtures containing enantiomerically pure chiral centers often display better pharmacological profiles than individual stereoisomers, unfortunately none of the racemates examined here possessed superior bioactivity values. It should therefore come as little surprise if structural modifications made around key residues present in helix II do affect antiproliferative efficacy. Indeed, introduction of bulky substituents onto position 7resulted in loss of antiprolifertaion effectsoffort = phenyl substituent 4g vs. naphthyl 3h versus thienyl 3i} whereas replacement of hydrogen atoms attached therebyled to increased potencyfoffer vs 1f. Analogue 1g bearing methoxy substitution on C-8wasinactive indicating importance of H bonding interactions near this region. Introduction of polar side chains proved detrimental to antitumor effect especially where larger moieties replaced hydrogens bonded to nitrogen atom.. While incorporation of fluorine ortho to hydroxyl moiety had minimal impact on IC5 0s, meta substitutions caused substantial decrease in cytostatic activities.2i Compound 1i possessing para fluoro substitutionw ere slightly active albeit still considerably weaker than tertisporatelv es. Surprisingly though, addition of bromine to carbon  1 0a decreased activity substantially again highlighting necessity of aromatic rings linked hydrophobicially across multiple bonds. Similarly, installation of chlorine reduced activity markedly even though electron withdrawing character bestowed similar hydrophobicity throughout the entire molecule.2k Incorporation of halogen substituted aryl bromide moieticed modest increase in cytotoxcity presumably due to steric hindrance introduced by halogens. On the basis of preliminary SAR data obtained above, modification strategies focused primarily on altering functionality located close to the central core of the scaffold. Accordingly, various approaches involving Suzuki cross couplings, Sonogashira crosscoupling chemistry, reductive amination procedures, nucleophilic displacement reaction protocols, etc., were employed successfully
