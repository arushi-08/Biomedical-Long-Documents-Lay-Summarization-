These processes require precise coordination among neurons and their targets throughout life span from embryonic stages until adulthood. During early postnatal period when neural circuits undergo rapid refinement due largely to elimination of redundant connections before reaching maturity, it has been shown recently using mouse models carrying mutations affecting various molecules involved in neuronal activity control pathways that specific subsets of developing cortical interneurons can be selectively eliminated depending upon genetic background but not sex differences [3 - 5]. However, whether similar selective pruning occurs also along peripheral nervous systems remains unknown because most studies have focused mainly on central rather than peripheral nerves owing partly to technical difficulties associated with studying innervation patterns directly ex utero under live conditions while maintaining intact innervations over long periods of time after birth. Recent advances made possible direct visualization of individual neurites innervating skeletal muscles both pre- and post synaptically together with simultaneous recording activities provided evidence suggesting differential roles played by different types of sensory afferents onto distinct classes of α motorneurons based on firing properties [6]. Thus far there exists no systematic analysis focusing exclusively on NMJ structure maintenance following denervation induced either genetically or surgically so our knowledge regarding factors controlling structural stability once NMJs form still remain limited despite extensive efforts devoted toward identifying genes required for normal functioning of mature cholinergic transmission machinery per se [7]. Moreover, although several recent reports suggested potential role of neurotrophins acting retrogradely across distal ends of growing fibers prior to initiation of myelination process leading to functional specification of CNS circuitry [8 - 9], very few if any candidates mediating signals originating distally were reported yet except those regulating survival versus death decisions postnatally where they act locally around sites undergoing degeneration [4]. Therefore identification of novel candidate ligands responsible for communication initiated remotely would help us understand more precisely what kind of information might reach remote parts of extending fiber tips en route towards final destination innervated postsynpattatic regions thereby providing clues concerning developmental programs governing wiring specificity. It should further allow better interpretation of results obtained previously employing pharmacological approaches targeting putative neurotrophic support derived intracellularly near degenerating areas since many drugs used could potentially affect intracellular transport mechanism itself thus making interpretations difficult even though some effects observed appear consistent with expectations generated earlier assuming local action only [1 0]. Finally one must keep in mind here again why all previous experiments performed relied heavily on animal mutants lacking certain gene products whose expressions had already reached completion well beyond stage E1 5 just preceding onset of major synaptogenic event marked by appearance of acetylcholine receptor clusters clustered beneath pre ‐ existing ones marking nascent junctions formed initially solely dependent on agrin secreted presynaptically whereas later phase involving additional contributions coming mostly likely independently off Schwann cells themselves leaving open questions pertaining timing relationship especially given possibility existence of two temporally separated phases operating simultaneously perhaps best exemplified by case of NGF knockout animals showing severe defects first apparent shortly thereafter then gradually improving eventually attaining nearly complete recovery albeit remaining significantly impaired compared to wild type littermates up till adult age possibly reflecting contribution of compensatory actions arising elsewhere besides sciatic plexus region targeted primarily being affected developmentally hence resulting overall milder phenotype seen relative to actual lack of neurotrophin production altogether rendering data somewhat less informative particularly considering fact that almost every molecule expressed endogenously appears capable of exerting its own unique effect independent of others present concurrently raising question related issues relating temporal order vs. redundancy issue etc... < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > One important aspect addressed herein concerns nature of intercellular communications occurring downstream of extracellular cues emanating out of distant locations away from original site initiating secretion of soluble mediators back entering proximal portions of elongating neurite termini presumably serving as “instructive ” guidance cue directing outgrowth direction ultimately determining ultimate location occupied by outgrown endings. Although numerous diffusible substances released extracellularly often referred collectively as morphogens having diverse range ranging widely spanning hundreds of microns surrounding each secreting source point nevertheless playing crucial regulatory roles guiding cellular migration pattern and fate determination much attention paid lately to membrane bound receptors localized close enough to transduce incoming environmental stimuli received subsequently activating cytoplasmic cascades finally influencing transcriptional program driving appropriate changes taking place inside nucleus culminating in altered output functionally manifested phenotypically observable traits e.g. morphological features displayed by tissues developed subsequent to perturbation of respective components constituting corresponding transduction cascade [1 1 -- 1 2].Among them canonical wnt family members like Wnt1 & Wnt3a play pivotal inductive influence promoting neurogenesis and gliogenesis respectively whilst Wnt5a plays opposite inhibitory influences favoring astrogenesis instead inhibiting oligodendrocyesis probably accounting partially behind reciprocal switching phenomena exhibited by neighboring
