 allows us not only to identify epitopes but also their relative orientation with respect to each other as well as within protein complexes or clusters at nanometer precision (∼ 1 0 nm) while maintaining single molecule sensitivity over several orders of magnitude dynamic range. We demonstrate our technique's ability both qualitatively via immunostaining experiments performed under different conditions such as fixation / permeabilization protocols; quantitatively against gold standards like quantum dots conjugated secondary anti bodies that vary widely in size depending upon conjugation chemistry used during synthesis; and finally its application toward identifying conformational changes associated with disease states where there may exist multiple conformations simultaneously expressed among cells expressing similar levels of antigen molecules per unit area. The results presented here show significant improvement compared to conventional techniques currently employed when studying membrane antigens including those involved directly related to human diseases. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction: ▃ Antibodies play important roles throughout biology ranging from immune response To date most methods rely heavily on either biochemical assays involving mass spectrometry Analysis has been limited due primarily to poor spatial accuracy combined with low temporal resolution which makes it difficult to distinguish between specific versus non speci city signals A variety of approaches exists for determining nanoscale structure However, many existing tools suffer limitations regarding speed, cost effectiveness, sample preparation requirements, etc. Here, we describe a novel approach called "SITE LOCO" (Single Molecule Localization Using Topological Image Averaging) capable of localizing individual ligands down to sub-2 5 Å rms error without any labeling strategy. By combining super ne graining algorithms with optical microscopy images obtained after staining samples with uorescent probes, we were able to localize biomolecules labeled specifically onto live mammalian plasma membranes. As proof of concept studies demonstrating utility of our tool, two distinct classes of targets -integrins and G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) - known to mediate key biological processes linked to cancer progression were studied. Integrins comprise heterodimeric transmembrane glycoproteins consisting out of alpha subunits connected noncovalently to beta subunit chains. These heterodimers form receptors responsible for mediating adhesion events essential for normal tissue homeostasis and wound healing Integrin clustering was observed following treatment with RGD peptides suggesting integrin activation induced receptor aggregation. GPCR signaling pathways involve heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins. g Proteins coupled seven trans spanning helix domains interact physically with downstream effectors leading ultimately to intracellular responses Finally, we demonstrated applicability towards mapping structural rearrangements occurring inside living systems since they could potentially lead to new insights into mechanisms underlying various pathologies. For example, HIV infection involves fusion mediated entry requiring large glycoprotein spikes protruding above viral envelope composed mainly of gp1 6 0. h Human immunodeficiency virus type I infects CD4 + T lymphocytes resulting in acquired immuno deficiency syndrome (AIDS) gp 4 1env trimer consists of three copies of gp4 1s attached together Non-natural amino acids containing photo activatable crosslinkers enable covalent crosslinking of interacting partners even if steric hindrance prevents direct contact. Photo activated cross linking reagents allow precise control over reaction kinetics allowing investigation of transient interactions between macromolecules. They offer advantages over chemical reactions because no additional catalysts need to be added along side reactants enabling faster rates than spontaneous ligation. Furthermore, unlike reversible chemistries required for chemically reactive groups, photoactive moieties do not require removal prior experimentation. Thus, photocrosslinkings should prove valuable especially given recent advances made possible by next generation sequencing technologies. With all current experimental procedures being labor intensive and expensive, developing fast yet reliable analytical methodologies will help expedite discovery efforts aimed at understanding complex biomolecular structures and dynamics. While much progress has already been realized utilizing state oftheart instrumentation and computational resources, further improvements would greatly bene t biomedical applications. One promising avenue lies in harnessing emerging capabilities offered by modern computing platforms to perform more sophisticated analyses beyond what standard computer hardware offers. Such developments include improved visualization software packages providing greater insight about data sets generated experimentally. Additionally, powerful so ware enables rapid prototyping of custom code facilitating easy implementation of advanced algorithmic workflows. Another exciting direction includes integration of cutting edge technology such as DNA origami scaffolds and nanopores into lab automation pipelines offering unprecedented opportunities for performing increasingly complicated tasks in parallel. Overall, the proposed methodology provides unique capability for addressing questions pertaining to fundamental aspects of immunology and infectious agents alike. It holds great promise particularly considering growing concerns surrounding drug resistance arising from pathogen evolution. Further investigations focused on elucidating details concerning antigenic variation amongst pathogens causing chronic infections might reveal critical information needed for designing effective therapeutics targeting highly mutatable viruses. Moreover, detailed characterization of glycan expression patterns found decorating surfaces of infected hosts' tissues paves way forward for better vaccine design. Lastly, future directions envisioned herein focus largely around improving detection limits inherent to label free measurements thereby increasing overall signal strength. Future extensions envision integrating higher order statistical models built off of raw pixel intensities rather than relying solely on Gaussian statistics thus enhancing robustness of measurement outcomes. < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ < METHOD > < FREETEXT > Methods ▃ Cell culture protocol Cells grown overnight before use had reached 8 0% con uency density then washed twice with PBS buffer followed by incubation with appropriate primary & secondary reagent solutions diluted appropriately
