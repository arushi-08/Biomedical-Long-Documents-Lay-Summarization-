In response, federal agencies have implemented new policies aimed at reducing overdoses through increased access to naloxone (an antidote) as well as expanded treatment programs such as buprenorphine maintenance therapy [4 8]. However, there remains no effective way to reverse acute opiate toxicity once it occurs because our understanding about what causes death following exposure has remained limited despite decades worth studying. Our work provides insight into one mechanism underlying fatal outcomes associated with opiates but also suggests potential therapeutic targets within specific circuits involved in respiration control. Moreover, given recent evidence suggesting some individuals who receive long term heroin replacement treatments can develop tolerance against their analgesic effects without experiencing withdrawal symptoms [5 6], identifying neural mechanisms controlling normal physiological responses could help inform future efforts toward developing safer pain management strategies than those currently available. Finally, since many drugs used recreationally target similar receptors on cells throughout the body including heart muscle tissue leading to cardiovascular complications like tachycardia, identification of circuit elements regulating cardiorespiratory function will likely be important not only towards improving safety during intoxication yet potentially informing development of therapeutics targeting other organ systems affected by disease states affecting multiple organs simultaneously. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All experiments were performed according to protocols approved under animal protocol  ANAUP-A0 8M0 0 0 0 2A issued by IACUC committee members affiliated with University of California San Francisco School of Medicine. Mice aged P1 6P2 5P3 0s weighing ~ 3g each received intraperitoneal injections containing either saline vehicle alone or morphine sulfate dissolved in sterile PBS solution diluted so mice would reach approximately 5mg / kg dose based upon weight measurements prior injection using standard dosing procedures described previously [5 7]. Respiratory rate was measured via whole mouse plethysmography immediately before injecting animals and then every minute until cessation occurred followed by resumption starting recording over another 5min period post recovery time when all recordings had stabilized again. Animals showing signs consistent with severe distress requiring euthanasia due to lack of movement or agonal respirations lasting longer than five minutes underwent decapitation directly off anesthesia cage top instead of being euthanized first undergoing cervical dislocation procedure if they showed any sign indicating imminent loss of consciousness. For optogenetic studies, adult male C5 7BL / 6J wild type littermates expressing Cre recombinase driven specifically in PreB catecholaminergic neuron population targeted by tyrosine hydroxylase promoter Tg (Th cre + ROSA LSL ChR2 EYFP H − J JAX stock number 0 1 6 2 9 9) along with littermate controls lacking expression of TH protein (i.e. non-transgenic offspring generated by crossing heterozygous parents carrying both alleles) were injected intraperitoneally daily with 1mg / ml tamoxifen citrate suspended in corn oil mixed thoroughly overnight beginning three days earlier. After seven consecutive days receiving oral gavage administration of Tamoxifen suspension pups continued to get gavages twice weekly till weaning age around postnatal week four. At least six weeks later, electrophysiological data acquisition began. To induce channelrhodopsin mediated neuronal activation, blue light pulses delivered bilaterally onto ventral medulla oblongata regions centered near midline dorsal surface of pons corresponding approximate location of pre-Botzinger complex (PBC) were applied continuously for up to1 0min duration interspersed among periods free of stimulation. Following completion of experiment brains fixed in paraformaldehyde fixative buffer prepared fresh beforehand were sectioned coronally at thickness ranging from1 mm thick slices obtained manually vibrating microtome Leica VT1 2M equipped with Microm HM 6 5 0V oscillating blade set at speed setting = -2 ° C and temperature controlled chamber maintained at room temp. Sections cut parallel to pial surfaces stained immunohistochemically processed further for visualization of c-Fos immunoreactivity essentially identical methods detailed elsewhere [5 8] except sections incubated sequentially with rabbit anti-cfos antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-5 2g lot D0 1P RRID AB _ 6 3 1 2 4 3) dilution factor ¼ × working concentration plus biotinylated goat secondary antibodies raised indonkey IgG fraction monoclonal HRP labeled species appropriate Alexa Fluor conjugated streptavidin conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific {"type": "entrez-nucleotide", "attrs": {"text": "A2 1 2 0 2", "term _ id": "6 4 1 3 5 5"}} A2 1 2 0 2- Life Technologies Cat No S3 2 3 5 1- Invitrogen A-2 1 2 0 2Dvl RRID AB _ 2 5 3 5 7 6 2) final dilutions of.1 ∶ 1 0 0 0 & 1 µg respectively together withDAPI nuclear counterstain added last step.

Fluorescence intensity profiles representing mean pixel intensities calculated separately forleft vs. right sides normalized relative to maximum values recorded for respective images taken individually served as basis for determining percentage change differences observed subsequent to experimental manipulations.
