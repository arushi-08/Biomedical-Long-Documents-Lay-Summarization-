 with predicting whether an intervention would increase / decrease firing rate for each cell type: if synaptic inhibition was stronger than excitation during ongoing activity then inactivating it should reduce spike rates; but when excitatory drive exceeded inhibitory input at some point over time, increasing excitability could have opposite effects on spiking depending upon which cells were excited first. These results suggest caution be taken before inferring functional equivalence between different classes of GABAergic neuron based solely on their optogenetic manipulation history - even within sensory cortices where they share many common features. ▃ ▃ ▃ SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT ▃ Cortical microcircuits contain diverse populations of fast acting GABA releasing interneurons whose precise contributions remain unclear despite decades of study. This paper shows why there can sometimes appear little correspondence across studies examining similar questions about two major subtypes of neocortical basket cells--one expressing either PV or SST proteins. Using mouse models allowing selective modulation of those same neuronal groups under natural conditions reveals distinct circuit computations performed specifically by PVvs sst--and suggests new ways forward towards understanding local computation mediated through individual neurogliaform cells as well other less defined subclasses like chandelier cells. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
