 binding sites on both sides of each pair of antiparallel protofibrils within one dimer unit at high concentrations leading to bundling or aggregation effects depending upon their concentration. Our results suggest mechanisms underlying membrane association with bacterial cytoskeletal elements such as MreBs which may be applicable more generally across diverse organisms including eukaryotes where similar arrangements have been observed recently (Kannan et al. Nature Communications 7: 1 0 3 9 8). The ability to form two distinct types of helical polymers provides new insights into possible roles played out during growth phases when cells undergo elongation rather than division cycles. These studies also open up opportunities towards understanding potential modes of action against pathogenic bacteria using antimicrobials targeting FtsZ assembly dynamics but not necessarily its GTPase activity alone since they target other aspects of Z ring structure stability through interactions between adjacent dimers along longitudinal interfaces formed via antiparallel pairing of neighbouring molecules. This work thus opens avenues toward future drug discovery efforts aimed specifically at disrupting key protein – lipid interaction surfaces involved in maintaining stable rod shaped morphology while leaving normal cellular functions intact. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Bacterial cytoskeleton systems play important functional role in many processes ranging from chromosome segregation To understand whether there might exist any structural differences among various classes of actins it was necessary first to determine if eukaryotic cytoplasmic F-type tubulins could assemble similarly forming paired helices under appropriate conditions. A recent report showed that human γ -tubulin can self-organise into double stranded microtubules albeit less efficiently compared to αβ - Tubulin Here we present evidence showing that members belonging to class I family of mre genes encode homologues capable of assembling into single strand oligomers consisting predominantly of short chains of monomers aligned head-totail resembling those seen previously only reported for ParM Although our data clearly indicate that coiled coil domains do indeed mediate lateral contacts required for polymerization, further experiments will need to address what effect mutations introduced here would exert over higher order polymer architecture given previous reports suggesting that inter subunit contact regions located outside of coils contribute significantly to overall curvature properties of polymeric assemblies. It should however be noted that although most residues mutated were found buried inside hydrophobic cores of individual protomers making them inaccessible to solvent exposure based on homology models generated earlier, some surface exposed positions remain available even after mutation indicating possibility of alternative conformations adopted due to flexibility around critical residue side chain rotamers. Further detailed mutational analysis coupled with X-ray crystallography together with electron microscopy imaging techniques used extensively so far to visualise filamentous arrays e.g. negative stain TEM However, despite being able to observe clear diffraction patterns indicative of ordered packing consistent with well defined helix morphologies, attempts made herein failed to obtain crystals suitable enough quality for obtaining complete crystallographic datasets likely because of inherent instability associated with long flexible linkers connecting N terminal domain bundles connected directly onto C terminus core bundle region containing G box motifs responsible for GTP hydrolysis. Therefore solution scattering methods combined with small angle neutron reflectometry measurements performed before crystallogenesis trials did prove useful providing information about relative orientations of constituent subunits within oligomeric units. Interestingly though, comparison of SAXS profiles obtained prior to crystallization trial revealed significant difference especially near q = ~ 4 Å − 1 corresponding approximately to interaxial spacing expected for dimeric building blocks comprising either parallel or anti-parallel strands respectively. Such observations suggested presence of multiple species possibly arising owing to dynamic equilibrium involving interconversion amongst several discrete conformers having varying degrees of overlap resulting ultimately in heterogeneity in oligomer size distribution. Given that no major change occurred following addition of GDP versus GTPγS ligand implying lack of involvement of nucleotides per se in mediating intermolecular associations, additional mutagenesis strategies designed explicitly taking advantage of existing knowledge regarding molecular determinants governing monomer folding state must still await development. Nevertheless, comparative analyses carried out on wild type samples prepared without added ligands yielded very good agreement between experimental curves collected pre vs. post sample preparation confirming absence of substantial contribution coming solely from buffer components nor does it seem reasonable therefore to expect large scale rearrangements occurring throughout course of experiment. Thus whilst low resolution envelopes derived from SANS cannot yet unambiguously distinguish between alternate architectures discussed above, nevertheless modelling approaches described below support existence of alternating configurations wherein certain features appear quite distinctive thereby allowing us to speculate about plausible reasons behind failure to crystallize mutant constructs bearing substitutions predicted computationally to disrupt proper conformation of linker segments joining N- & C- termini. Furthermore, the fact that mutants harbouring alterations affecting charged amino acids positioned just upstream of G1 motif exhibited reduced propensity to oligomerise suggests importance of electrostatic forces contributing additionally to stabilisation of putative interface geometries identified experimentally. While details concerning exact nature of proposed salt bridges remains speculative considering proximity of interacting partners and limited number of points considered, nonetheless computational docking simulations conducted successfully provided initial guesses enabling generation of hypothetical model illustrating probable mode of dimerisation mediated exclusively by charge complementarity driven primarily by ionic bonds. As mentioned already, the majority of variants tested displayed compromised capacity to rescue ΔmrdA phenotype pointing again strongly to significance of correct positioning of particular groups participating in stabilising interfacial geometry. Moreover, observation of altered behaviour particularly relating to A2 2 induced morphological defects hints indirectly at potentially complex interplay between factors controlling spatial organisation of intracellular networks composed mainly of bundled
