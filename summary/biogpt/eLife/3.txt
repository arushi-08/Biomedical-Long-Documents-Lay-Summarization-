In addition, deforestation contributes significantly to anthropogenic emission sources including agricultural waste products used during crop production – particularly nitrogen fertilizer - leading to increased nutrient leaching into waterbodies resulting in eutrophication effects detrimental not only directly but also indirectly via reduced water quality affecting fish populations and aquatic food webs essential for sustaining biodiversity throughout ecosystems worldwide. As well as direct losses from land use changes due to fires, agriculture, mining etc …, indirect loss occurs when people abandonment leads to conversion back to forested areas thereby increasing exposure risk factors associated with hunting activity itself.... These issues have led many countries around the world to consider alternative ways forward involving sustainable development strategies based upon ecological restoration approaches rather than relying solely on traditional forms of resource extraction i.e. clearing large tracts of native vegetation while maintaining ecosystem services provided by remaining intact systems. Such initiatives include reforestations following timber harvesting operations aimed both at improving local livelihoods whilst enhancing conservation values. However it must first ensure effective implementation without compromising sustainability given recent evidence suggesting negative consequences arising out of widespread tree removal practices coupled with limited understanding regarding long term outcomes after disturbances. For example, studies suggest significant reductions in species richness can occur even though some plant functional groups remain unaffected under intensive management regimes designed specifically to conserve diversity.The impact of different types of interventions depends largely on their spatial scale ranging between small localised actions undertaken locally versus larger landscape level policies implemented globally. While much work exists examining short time scales responses to stand thinning treatments using field experiments conducted either manually or remotely controlled platforms, little effort was directed toward assessing longer term implications especially those related to community resilience mechanisms operating beyond immediate intervention periods. A better knowledge base would help inform policy makers who need information concerning possible future trajectories before implementing new measures intended to restore degraded landscapes. Here we present results obtained applying our recently developed dynamic process driven biogeochemical simulation framework called CANSIM * -REDD applied here to analyse patterns emerging among sites differing widely along climatic gradients representing two major biogeographic regions of tropical South America namely eastern Brazil (Atlantic Forest biome sensu lato) and western Ecuador (Andean region sensu strictu). Our aim being to assess whether current levels of protection could lead to similar overall trends irrespective of location since previous analyses had shown contrasting response depending on site characteristics. To achieve this objective we focus primarily on quantifying variation observed amongst surviving trees vs. seedlings growing up subsequent generations thus providing insights relating to processes underlying differential survival probabilities. Specifically, we examine variations occurring in terms of basal area increment per unit length (BAI mm yr -1 m -2), mortality rate constant k = -0 · 6 4 7 9 + 8 · e − 4t (R2 = 0 · 8 4 p ≤ 0 · 0 0 1), recruitment probability P = c × exp {ln (x)} n ° d ^ l ~ r (y) (R ² = 0 · 8 3 p ≥ 0 ∙ 0 0 1) and annual productivity Y = g cm -3 yr -1 M ¯ ≈ f ´ X b 'T h'i (Rmax = 0 · 8 8p.0 0 1) reflecting distinct roles played respectively by woody plants vs herbaceous components contributing to above ground live mass accumulation. Results indicate clear relationships linking abiotic conditions prevailing prior to treatment onset together with biotic attributes influencing early stages of secondary succession events hence highlighting important drivers shaping successional pathways regardless of geographical locations considered herein. Moreover they reveal critical thresholds below which positive feedbacks become less likely implying lower chances of success once external constraints exceed certain limits. Finally, estimates derived demonstrate considerable variability yet consistent tendencies indicating substantial capacity available for recovering lost stocks although varying considerably according to specific circumstances linked mainly to pre-cut condition severity combined with intrinsic properties inherent to particular taxa involved. Overall, our study provides valuable insight onto determinants driving temporal shifts in composition and structure underpinning primary succession cascades potentially impacting downstream functioning capacities ultimately determining eventual system stability. It highlights opportunities offered by combining remote sensing data sets alongside spatially explicit models allowing us to identify hotspots prone to rapid turnover offering guidance for decision making pertaining to optimal timing of control schemes aiming at restoring damaged environments. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Following extensive sampling campaigns carried out annually starting one month after selective cuts were initiated until three consecutive surveys completed approximately
