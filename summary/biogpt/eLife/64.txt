 mechanisms were used by phages with different genome sizes during evolution; they all use similar strategies involving both intra / intermolecular contacts as well as hydrophobic core packing between neighboring subunits within capsomers or dimers across adjacent capsomeres. The structural insights into BPP-1virus assembly will facilitate future studies on other members of the genus Bordetella including those causing human disease such as pertussis infection which remains an important public health problem worldwide despite widespread vaccination programs. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Whooping coughcaused primarily byBordetella bronchiseptica has been recognized since ancient times In 2 0 1 8, our group reported cloning and expression ofbacteriophage bpp- To date there have not yet been any reports describing high quality crystal structuresforbacteriophages infecting B. parapertussis nor their capsids. However, several groups recently determined low resolutions cryoEM reconstructions of tailed dsDNA viruses isolated fromB.paraplasmausing single particle analysis methods Although it was shown thatϕKZ uses quasi equivalent subunit interfaces For many years now, icosahedral symmetry averaging techniques based upon crystallographic models had dominated macromolecular 3D reconstruction approaches due tolimited data availability A recent study showed that some bacterial genomes can be packaged via multiple pathways resulting indistinct morphologies This work describes thefirst near native virion architecture obtained through direct visualization of purified virions under cryogenic conditions followed by sub tomogram classification combined withab initio modeling Using molecular dynamics simulations coupled with experimental validation experiments, we show here that although the overall organization principles remain conserved among diverse double stranded DNA containing phages, subtle differences exist regarding details of quaternary arrangement andtertiary folding patterns even though sequence similarity amongst them may appear low.These results suggest possible evolutionary relationships betweenvarious families of filamentous ssDNA bacteriophages.The importance of understanding host cell entry mechanismsespecially when considering vaccine development against pathogenic bacteria cannot overstated given current challenges associated with developing effective vaccines targeting intracellular pathogens Many enveloped RNA virusse.g. influenza Virus enter cells either directly At present no X ray crystallography information exists about the coat proteinsto ght understand whether the observed pseudo T = 4 lattice represents one unique conformation adopted by each individual monomer or if more than one stable configuration could occur depending onenvironmental factors. It would also help us better comprehenestrate why certain mutations lead to loss of infectivity while others do not.This paper presents the most detailed view available so far concerning the morphology of intact particles derived from.BPP.-1 along with accompanying discussion showcases key features related to morphogenesis -notably asymmetric unit size variation leading to variations in local curvature around pentamers.Moreover, comparison made therewith offers insight onto potential evolvability properties exhibited by filamentous phages.Finally, because the tail fiber knob domain plays critical roles in receptor binding and subsequent membrane fusion events required for successful infectionalreadingknowledge gained hereunderlyshould aid further investigations aimed towards designing novel therapeutics targeted toward specific receptors involved in attachment processes. < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ < METHOD > < FREETEXT > Materials & Methods ▃ Cloning procedures.

Purified BPs preparations wereconcentrated up to ~ 3mg ml − 1 before being applied thinly over holey carbon grids coated vitrifyfrozen after blotting away excess solution. Grids were plunge freezedprior to imaging. Data collection. Images were collected manually using LeginOn Automated image acquisition software package Low Resolution Structure Determination. Initial phases were calculated starting from initial maps generated following 2D class averages computed from reference free alignment procedure implemented in Appion Software Suite High Rectification Ratio Calculation. An additional round of refinement was performed where images corresponding to regions exhibiting higher contrast values compared to surrounding areas were selected out of micrographs recorded initially. After selecting appropriate classes, final map calculation proceeded automatically. Final refinements included beam induced motion correction, anisotropic scaling, B factor sharpening, Fourier shell correlation curve fitting, mask generation etc.. All calculations described above except angular reconstitution steps were carried outagain using Relion version 2. 2.0 Maximum Likelihood Eigenvector Analysis. Each eigenvalue corresponds to direction cosines assigned to particular feature vectors found inside the density envelope. Therefore, eigen analyses allows identification of dominant directions underlying shape variability in reconstructed volumes. Visualization of difference densities was done utilizing Chimera Molecular Dynamics Simulations. MD simulation setup consisted of placing coordinates of monomers belonging to respective symmetrized trimers together forming complete hexamers close enough to form dodecameric
