 molecules appear at least 1 day prior to any detectable decline in viability or growth rate; thus they may serve as biomarkers indicative of impending mortality rather than simply markers associated with chronological age itself. These results suggest new avenues through which longevity can potentially be extended beyond what has previously been possible using caloric restrictions alone: targeting specific pathways involved in regulating intracellular reducing power (e.g. NADP + / NAD) could help extend healthy life span without compromising overall fitness under normal conditions. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
