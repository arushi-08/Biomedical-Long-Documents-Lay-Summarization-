 listener's performance as being due primarily to impaired auditory scene analysis rather than peripheral deficits or central compensation strategies such as increased attention allocation during spoken word recognition tasks. This study demonstrates an approach combining psychoacoustic measures at multiple levels along the sensory pathway can predict individual differences among listeners who have similar audiograms yet different perceptual abilities when faced with complex natural sounds like those encountered by everyday life conversations. It also provides evidence supporting clinical use of non invasive electrophysiological measurements combined with psychophysical assessments designed specifically to measure underlying physiological processes involved in sound segregation / integration within realistic environments where competing sources co occur simultaneously over time scales ranging from milliseconds through seconds. These methods may help identify individuals whose problems arise early on in development before they become aware behaviorally so intervention efforts might begin earlier instead of later after diagnosis is made based solely upon pure tone audiometry results alone. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
