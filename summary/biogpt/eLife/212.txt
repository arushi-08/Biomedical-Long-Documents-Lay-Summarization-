 with each other during patterning processes. We propose an updated model where heterotypic coupling via two different connexin subunits forms functional channels within chromatophore populations leading to coordinated activity necessary for proper development of stripes at later stages than previously thought: first by promoting interaction among neighboring cells then also through lateral communication across adjacent rows or columns along individual body segments. This study provides novel insights into mechanisms underlying pigmentation diversity in vertebrates including humans. © 2 0 1 7 American Society For Developmental Biology.
