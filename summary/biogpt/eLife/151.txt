 molecule could not enter nuclei without assistance from at least one NLS; however, it was still possible when all other parameters were equal: if only 1 or 2 weak interactions between an imported protein and its receptor existed then no significant increase occurred beyond 3 × -fold enhancement over background levels. The number of strong interaction sites increased linearly until saturation where additional proteins did nothing further enhance translocation rates significantly above those observed under conditions lacking multiple high affinity contacts. Our data suggest that efficient nucleocytoplasmic trafficking requires both specific recognition events mediated primarily by low avidity multi valent bonds but also cooperative effects arising due to simultaneous engagement of several nucleoporins within each docking site during initial stages of diffusion into NPCs. These observations have important implications regarding design principles underlying viral vectors used for gene therapy applications which should take account of virus particle geometry including surface charge distribution along with spatial arrangement / spacing of targeting ligands relative to cell entry mechanisms employed e.g. endocytosis versus direct membrane fusion pathways. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Nuclear envelope breakdown occurs naturally every time eukaryotic mitotic division creates daughter chromosomes separated inside newly formed cytoplasm. In contrast viruses must traverse cellular membranes before they reach host nucleus after infection so long distance genome delivery does occur efficiently across many different types of mammalian somatic cells. mRNA export has been studied extensively using single RNA imaging techniques To address whether multivalency plays any functional roles in mediating effective macromolecular traffic though pores, here we use synthetic biology approaches combined with live cell microscopy assays to study quantitatively the relationship among ligand density, overall net positive charges per unit mass, total length and diameter of three distinct classes of artificial cargos ranging from small spherical nanoparticles down to filamentous structures containing hundreds of copies of individual components connected together by flexible linkers. Using well characterised recombinant human karyopherins Kapβ2 Transportin mediates active bidirectional movement towards cytoplasmic side while importins Importin α and β mediate unidirectional movements toward nucleoplasm Side chain modifications enable precise control of electrostatic properties of engineered macromolecules thus enabling systematic studies of structure activity relationships involved in various aspects of intracellular processes involving charged species Herein, we report detailed kinetic analysis revealing critical factors governing successful passage of diverse sized complexes bearing varying densities of positively ionisable groups across biological barriers represented by reconstituted Xenopus laevis oocyte nucleopores. By systematically altering experimental variables related either directly to chemical composition of test objects or indirectly to physicochemical features associated with them, we demonstrate experimentally determined values corresponding to "optimal radius" required for productive diffusive motion through the central channel of reconstructed X. laevis oocytes comparable to theoretical estimates obtained previously for passive Brownian motions confined in cylindrical channels Based upon measured rate constants k i app s -1 = f − ln [I] n + K d D m M -2 ≈ 4 • 1 0s -3 nM -0. 8 9 ± 0. 0 8μM -4. 9mM -6. 7µM -7. 6pM -8. 5fM -9. 0mMpredicted residence times τ r ~ min ≤ T ≥ ∞ This work provides new insights about fundamental physical limits imposed onto intranuclear dynamics of highly negatively polarised polyelectrolytes interacting non specifically with numerous negative patches present throughout the inner face of native vertebrate nuclear envelopes < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ < METHOD > < FREETEXT > Materials & Methods ▃ All chemicals unless otherwise stated were purchased form Sigma Aldrich Ltd UK except Alexa Fluor ® dyes conjugated peptides synthesised according to standard Fmoc chemistry protocols described elsewhere Recombinant GST tagged Karyopherin β1 Protein expression vector pGEX 6P-Kpnb1 encoding full length wild type mouse Karyphrin beta1 fused N terminal glutathione S transferase tag followed C terminus His6 Tag sequence was transformed into E. coli BL2 1 DE3 strain competent cells. pDEST1 7 plasmid expressing His Tagged Mouse ImpαΔIBB domain comprising residues 1-4 6 deleted for amino acids 4 7-5 7 was kindly provided by Prof. Jane Goodman's laboratory University College London School Of Pharmacy.
