 tumor suppressor function during tumorigenesis. SIGNIFICANCE: These results reveal new roles for H3K3 6me as both positive regulator of DSB sensing / DDR pathway choice through regulation of H3K4me3 levels at sites flanking damaged loci and negative modulator of genomic stability via maintenance of p5 3BP1 protein expression following genotoxic stress. GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT SUMMARY: The authors describe here two distinct functions exerted on cellular responses toward DNA damages regulated by trimethylation of H3K4 or K3 6 residues respectively; one being essential for efficient recruitment of 5 3BP1 proteins onto broken chromosomes while another contributing to maintaining proper level of P5 3 phosphorylation which ultimately promotes cancer progression when lost due to mutations within its gene locus. This work reveals previously unknown mechanisms underlying epigenetic control over key events occurring early along the process leading from recognition of chromosomal breakage up until completion of faithful chromosome segregation ensuring accurate transmission of genetic information across generations.

Recent studies have shown their involvement also outside developmental processes where they regulate tissue homeostasis under normal physiological conditions but can be hijacked aberrantly resulting in disease onset like cancers [2 - 4]. Here, using human kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells exposed either directly to ionizing radiation or indirectly to oxidative free radicals generated endogenously were used model systems mimicking acute exposure scenarios likely encountered naturally e.g., environmental pollutants causing direct insults whereas chronic exposures could occur if associated diseases result in increased production of reactive oxygen species generating indirect effects similar those observed experimentally i.e. aging related pathologies etc.. Our data suggest that trimethylated Lysine residue three six located near break ends plays dual functional importance regulating not only initial steps involved in detection of DNA Damage Response signals emanating form site of lesion however it has additional downstream consequences affecting later phases involving homology directed recombinational repairs thus providing evidence supporting our hypothesis regarding potential existence of “mitotic memory ” imparted post replication errors thereby allowing propagation of potentially deleterious changes even though some aspects remain unclear yet. Finally, given recent reports suggesting possible therapeutic benefits conferred by inhibition of specific enzymes controlling methylation status of histones especially focusing attention towards targeting aberrant activity of methyltransferases known to drive oncogenesis particularly among solid tumors harboring somatic inactivating mutation in genes encoding Trithorax group members whose products mediate deposition of trimethyl mark on Lys four position of Histones therefore further understanding about molecular basis governing interplay between different types of posttranslational covalent alterations will help us devise better strategies against various malignancies driven primarily because of defects therein. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > KEYWORDS: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Acute irradiation induced DNA damage, Oxidative Stress Induced DNA damage, Methylation, Kidney Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells, Homology Directed Recombinational Repair, Mitotic Memory < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All living organisms face constant threats posed mainly by exogenous agents damaging macromolecules posing threat ranging from single stranded nicks arising spontaneously to more complex forms caused mostly exogenously namely UV light inducing pyrimidine dimers followed by bulky adducts formed chemically reacting chemicals forming cross links etc. giving rise to many kinds of structural aberrations in nucleic acids hence compromising integrity of genomes eventually culminating in mutagenesis and carcinogenesis [1]. To counteract detrimental effect imposed by any kind of insult several highly conserved pathways collectively termed ‘ DNA Damage Responses ’ exist comprising sensors detecting presence of altered bases and other chemical moieties present predominantly in non coding regions of eukaryotic nuclear DNAs called telomeres protecting them from degradation and fusion together constituting major components responsible for initiating signal transduction cascades finally activating effector molecules mediating appropriate biological outcomes depending largely on type of injury inflicted [2]. Among others Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated kinase acting upstream of Chk1- Chk2 axis constitutes central component playing crucial part in coordinating timely execution of multiple checkpoints activated immediately subsequent to induction of DNA damage irrespective whether incurred externally or internally owing essentially to generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) produced physiologically serving critical homeostatic purpose helping maintain redox balance inside body keeping pace with metabolic demands [3]. Although there exists ample literature documenting intricate details pertaining to nature of stimuli eliciting respective cascade initiated immediate phase before initiation of delayed effectors operating next step till restoration back to pre-stressed state ensues still much remains elusive concerning precise mechanistic underpinnings dictating temporal order wherein each individual event takes place once again emphasizing need for detailed investigation addressing above issues so far leaving behind gaps requiring urgent answers. Given fact that most eukaryotes possess large number of repetitive sequences scattered around entire length of linear chromatids making them prone to spontaneous deamination reactions rendering them susceptible to base pair mismatches ensuing accumulation of point mutational load increasing risk factor predisposing individuals carrying defective alleles conferring predisposition to variety of disorders characterized majorly
