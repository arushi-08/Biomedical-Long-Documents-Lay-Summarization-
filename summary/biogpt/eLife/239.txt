 editor = "text box: incomplete description not shown..." > This article has earned an Open Data Badge for making publicly available data necessary for replicating analyses reported here; however, because some datasets were generated previously published studies may have been used where appropriate credit should be given to those individuals who provided original experimental materials rather than subject them directly to review as part of our study design. For example, Roger Nicoll's lab contributed Figure 1 — figure supplement 2 panel B from which all other figures presented herein would likely also come out during revision process if they had made use thereof. As such it will remain possible to reproduce any conclusions drawn based on analysis performed at Rogers' laboratory upon request. To access the full set of computer code underlying Figures 3 – 5, visit https: / / github.com / jbhny / vmr-synapse-quantifications  cite. All custom scripts required to replicate Figs 4 & 6 can be found online under DOI: 1 0. 7 9 8 4.9 9mTc @ pti.hutton.ac.uk / ~ szwang / VMRSynapse. Raw images corresponding to Fig. 1A could be accessed via Zenodo repository [doi]: doi.org / 1 0. 5 2 8 1 / zenodo.1 3 7 0 0 0 0. Source codes describing experiments described throughout manuscript including quantification methods files containing raw values obtained through automated image processing steps prior to manual inspection are freely distributed along with sample output file names listed below. These include details about imaging conditions applied e.g. pH indicator dye loading time course experiment, Ca + measurements etc … In addition, additional information regarding statistical tests employed etc. was included within supplementary material section “Statistics ” above. We thank Dr. Jonathan Dittman ’ s group for providing us with antibodies against RIM proteins while Drs. David Schoch and John Newsom kindly donated plasmids encoding synaptopHluorin constructs respectively.
