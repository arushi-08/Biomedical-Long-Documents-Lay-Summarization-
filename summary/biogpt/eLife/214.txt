 village was observed; however no clusters existed within households that participated fully during treatment rounds. These results suggest potential solutions including improved community engagement strategies as well as more effective targeting at household level using vector control tools such bed nets / indoor residual spraying. This work provides valuable information about factors associated with transmission dynamics which can be used by national programs implementing interventions like MDAs where there may exist hidden pockets of disease activity due to sub optimal coverage levels among certain populations. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
