 gametes leads to double fertilisation events: one resulting into diploid sporophytes carrying both parental genomes while another gives rise to triploid gametophytes containing only paternally contributed DNA sequences. This process has been proposed as driving speciation through allopolyploidy [1 – 3] but also provides opportunities for genome duplication via hybridisation between closely related species or hybridization within polyploid lineages such as wheat crops like hexaploids Triticum aestivum L. and T. turgidum ssp. durum Desf.. However, it remains unclear whether polyploidisation can be tolerated at all if there exists no mechanism preventing hybridisations involving more distantly related parents than those involved during natural evolution. To address this question experimentally requires knowledge about mechanisms controlling reproductive barriers after hybrid crosses including post zygotic developmental processes before they lead to sterility / lethality due to genetic incompatibilities among hybrids produced under laboratory conditions. One possible barrier could involve differences in gene expression patterns induced upon crossing different partners because some genes may act antagonistically depending on their parent origin e.g. ref  4 9 5 6 0 7 encoding a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase was found up regulated specifically when Arabidopsis thaliana pollen grains were crossed against A. lyrata female tissue whereas down regulation occurred following pollination using reciprocal cross combinations suggesting antagonistic functions dependent on gamete identity. Another possibility would include changes affecting regulatory proteins acting downstream effectors rather then directly regulating target transcripts since many transcriptional activators belong to families comprising members having similar binding specificities making them difficult targets even though individual mutations often do not result in strong phenotypes. For example, several studies suggest that trans factors interacting upstream components of signalling pathways might play important roles determining heterosis effects observed across plant populations although few examples exist so far [8 – 1 0]. It should however be noted here that none of our experiments addressed potential interactions occurring immediately after mating; instead we focused mainly on later stages where embryos develop inside developing seeds thus allowing us to investigate molecular aspects underlying early steps towards fertility restoration without interference caused by other physiological constraints associated with reproduction per se. Our data suggests that functional complementation occurs rapidly enough once zygotes fuse together thereby restoring normal growth rates despite genomic incompatibility arising shortly thereafter. Moreover, based on previous work showing rapid accumulation of mRNA molecules originating exclusively from either partner ’ s nucleus soon after zygote union, we speculate that successful establishment of proper embryonic patterning depends primarily on differential activation of specific sets of nuclear encoded mRNAs transcribed solely from each respective gametic compartment i.e. nuclei harbouring distinct complements of chromatin modifying enzymes required for establishing correct cellular fates. Thus, given sufficient time frame available for reprogramming, any deleterious effect imposed by incompatible alleles will probably manifest itself much earlier compared to late stage embryogenesis wherein major morphological alterations become apparent. Interestingly, recent evidence indicates that imprinting plays indeed less prominent role in shaping phenotypic variation already well ahead of gastrulation implying significant contribution made by non imprinted loci operating relatively close to initial phases of differentiation possibly reflecting evolutionary history behind angiosperms diversification. Therefore, future investigations focusing particularly on pre germination phase shall help better understand what makes certain individuals capable of overcoming detrimental consequences brought forth by interspecific hybridizations especially considering current trends toward increased use of intergeneric crossings amongst crop varieties grown worldwide. Finally, understanding basic principles governing compatibility issues encountered along interspecies transmissions promises new insights regarding conservation strategies aimed at preserving biodiversity hotspots harboring high levels of diversity yet threatened by anthropogenic activities. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All lines used throughout study except wild type Col ecotype carry homozygous mutation disrupting activity of FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENCE6A locus causing failure of repression of transposable elements located outside pericentromeric regions known collectively as FIS domain repeats.

After three weeks seedlings resistant to antibiotic treatment were transferred back to soil pots until emergence of adult rosette leaves followed by genotyping PCR analysis performed essentially as reported elsewhere. Plants lacking detectable amount of corresponding transcript indicated homozygosity for mutated fei6a sequence. Homozygous fie1 null mutant line SALK _ 0 0 3 5 5 3C generated originally by Alonso et al. served as control genotype exhibiting typical phenotype expected for loss of PRC2 mediated silencing over entire class II transposon arrays present therein.
