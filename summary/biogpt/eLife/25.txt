. This work provides an example where mathematical modelling can be used as part of experimental design rather than post hoc analysis; it also demonstrates potential benefits from integrating models across scales when studying pathogens such as P. falciparum.Please see related Research article: http: / / genomebiology.biomedcentral.com / articles / 1 0 · 2 4 7 8 5 9 3 / s1 (last accessed April 6) For further resources relating to our modeling study we request contact David M.

Fergusson @ gmail.org ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Pathogens evolve rapidly due both to their short generation times In addition to generating new variants within host infections there may well exist other mechanisms whereby different alleles compete over time between co-infecting parasites To address questions about which factors drive changes in allele frequencies during infection one must consider two distinct but interacting processes -mutation rate and selective forces acting upon them. Mutation rates vary among loci according to several parameters including GC content, replication timing, transcription level, chromatin structure and DNA repair pathways Here I present results obtained using an individual patient simulation approach called 'agnostic' Agent Based Modeling (ABM) We use data collected previously From previous studies examining sequence polymorphism in malaria patients infected with P.f. Thompson et al have shown that many polymorphic positions fall outside coding regions Our goal was not only to explore whether specific features could explain observed differences in allelic frequency change amongst var2csa sequences but more importantly determine what additional information might emerge if they were considered together instead of separately. Specifically, given evidence suggesting that some polymorphisms affect protein function while others do Not surprisingly most mutations occur randomly throughout the genome However, because each site has been sampled individually so far no single feature explains why certain types show greater variability compared to others. e.g. AT rich codons tend towards higher mutability Overall, however, codon usage does appear important since synonymous substitutions exhibit lower variance relative to non-synonomous ones. As expected silent substitution variances correlate positively with GC3s whereas nonsynonymous variabilities negatively correlates With respect to amino acid properties, arginine residues display significantly less inter-sample divergence than any other residue type except cysteine Interestingly, although overall dN values differ little depending on position along the length of the molecule, those located near N terminus generally experience much larger increases in intra-group divergences following invasion events leading up to clinical symptoms Compared to recent analyses focusing solely on pairwise comparisons of nucleotide alignments Smith & Eyre-Walker found similar numbers of positive diversifying selections per year These authors did find significant correlations between mean dS estimates derived either directly from aligned nucleotides or indirectly after aligning predicted proteins There appears therefore to be considerable scope for future investigations combining empirical observations alongside detailed mechanistic simulations to better understand evolutionary drivers shaping genomic architecture in human pathogenic microbes like Malaria Parasites express large families of variant surface antigens encoded by multigene multicopy arrays known collectively as "vars". Each member encodes approximately sixty tandemly arranged copies organized around three conserved introns A key aspect of understanding evolution operating in asexual blood stage forms lies in determining exactly who's going driving whom in terms of adaptation. One way forward would involve developing realistic computational frameworks capable of simulating interactions occurring simultaneously between diverse genotypes comprising hundreds of individuals representing heterogeneous mixtures of clones Circulating clonal lineages often dominate early stages of disease progression While existing approaches focus primarily on describing relationships between pairs of isolates taken sequentially from a few subjects, here my aim is first to develop methods allowing us to simulate whole genomes evolving continuously in parallel without requiring prior knowledge regarding genotype composition before proceeding to investigate possible explanations arising out of particular combinations of competing subpopulations. Second, I will examine predictions made concerning diversification profiles generated assuming various hypotheses involving differential fitness effects associated with alternative sets of segregating haplotypes. Finally, I shall compare simulated distributions against available epidemiological datasets pertaining to var repertoire sharing in natural settings. My primary motivation behind constructing AGBM stems partly from its capacity to generate novel insights beyond simple pair wise statistics alone. By providing explicit descriptions of underlying biological phenomena I hope to highlight areas worthy of closer investigation particularly considering growing interest being placed increasingly on exploring emergent behaviours resulting from complex systems biology perspectives On top of predicting outcomes emerging from hypothetical scenarios I am interested too in testing experimentally plausible ways of manipulating system behaviour. Such experiments require careful consideration of sampling strategies and appropriate statistical tools. Given the complexity involved in running AGBMs I believe that working closely with experimentalists should prove valuable especially insofar as it allows researchers to test assumptions underpinning theoretical formulations whilst avoiding unnecessary experimentation. Below I describe details surrounding construction of the initial version of the AGBM described above followed by discussion of subsequent refinements aimed specifically toward improving accuracy and robustness of inferences drawn from outputs produced by the program. Further explanation of code implementing AGBM follows below. < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃
