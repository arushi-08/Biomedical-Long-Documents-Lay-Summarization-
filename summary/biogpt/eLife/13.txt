To identify potential targets of P. infestans RXLR effectors during infection, transgenic N. benthamiana plants expressing C terminally 3xFLAG tagged versions of each candidate were generated as described previously For further characterization of identified interactors, they should be expressed at endogenous levels under control of their native promoters. Therefore, expression constructs encoding full length coding sequences fused N terminal to eGFP driven either via CaMV promoter I or II respectively were made. These vectors allowed us not only testing whether interactions could also occur when fusion tags other than 3x Flag tag had been attached but additionally enabled monitoring subcellular localization patterns upon transient transformation through confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In addition, since all tested candidates showed nuclear enrichment after Agrobacterium mediated delivery to leaves it was important to test if any observed changes might have resulted due to overexpression artifacts caused e.g. by saturation effects within nuclei. As shown before Transient Expression Analysis revealed no visible phenotype resulting from ectopic over production of selected putative target proteins alone except for transiently overexpressed PEXRD5 which led to chlorosis similar to what can result from constitutive activation of SA signaling pathways We next analyzed possible colocalization between different baits and prey pairs including known peroxisomal markers such as catalase CATALASE2 (CTAR2) and PTS1 containing matrix enzymes ACOX1 and MLS All three bait fusions localized predominantly inside nucleus while most of the preys accumulated outside thereof indicating lack of strong association among individual members of our set up even though some overlap occurred especially between PEXR5 and its closest paralog PEXR6 suggesting functional redundancy (Fig. Co-precipitation experiments confirmed physical binding events detected above. Since both pexR homologs share high amino acid identity around predicted NLS motifs (Supplementary Figure Next, we wanted to determine where exactly the respective complex would form intracellularly given that none of the investigated proteins contain transmembrane domains nor do possess obvious signal peptides directing secretion across membranes. It turned out that peroxisomes exist mainly as single organelles whereas many cells harbor multiple ones making intracellular transport difficult to study Peroxisome biogenesis requires import machinery consisting primarily of peroxins encoded by PEX family Genes encode several classes of integral PMPs involved directly in peroxisome assembly, maintenance and division Among those there exists one class called soluble receptors whose function involves recognition of specific PTS signals present exclusively in targeted substrates After confirming stable associations found earlier, additional tests aimed at determining specificity determinants required for efficient recruitment of certain cargoes onto particular adaptors. First, we asked about involvement of various parts of the PEX1 0 coiled coil domain responsible for mediating self dimerization Our results indicate that besides being able to bind itself efficiently, PEXR2 interacts strongly enough so far beyond detection level with almost every member of the group comprising PEXRs plus WIPI2B thus forming large heteromeric assemblies capable of recruiting diverse sets of cargos simultaneously (Figs. Interaction studies performed here suggest existence of more selective mechanisms controlling substrate selection rather then simple binary competition model based solely on affinities determined mostly by short linear peptide regions located near N- terminus of ligands. This suggests presence of yet unidentified structural features allowing discrimination amongst closely homologous PX-BAR superfamily members despite overall similarity in structure and biochemical properties Despite extensive efforts neither GST pull down assays nor BiFC analyses provided evidence supporting homodimerization behavior exhibited by PEXR4 although previous reports suggested otherwise While analyzing the ability of PEX5R variants carrying mutations affecting residues critical for lipid bilayer insertion capacity to interact with ATG8s, we noticed significant reduction in affinity towards ATG8A compared to wildtype counterpart (Figs.6B6B shows quantification data obtained following reciprocal coIPs carried out according to scheme depicted in Fig.6C Overall, our observations support hypothesis stating that distinct subsets of autophagic machineries may operate independently depending on available resources thereby ensuring flexibility necessary for rapid adjustment responses to changing environment. Although still speculative however, possibility remains open why simultaneous depletion of four isoforms belonging to same subfamily seems essential considering relatively low number of paralogs per genome reported until now. Further work will reveal answers regarding molecular details underlying differential regulation mechanism employed by hosts' core ATG systems leading ultimately to induction of appropriate defensive strategies. Taken together, identification of novel players operating upstream of key steps regulating macroautophagy provides new insights toward understanding regulatory networks governing fundamental biological functions involving dynamic interplay between nutrient sensing TOR kinases and downstream regulators ATG1 3s and ULK1 Serine phosphorylation sites play crucial roles in modulating activity state of numerous eukaryotic factors including
