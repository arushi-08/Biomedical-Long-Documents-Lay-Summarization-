 is sufficient to alter hypothalamic function via glucocorticoids signaling pathways. Social buffering appears critical during development when HPA axis maturation occurs; whereas after puberty it becomes less important as basal levels rise with aging. This study provides insight into mechanisms underlying sex differences observed across multiple physiological systems including behavior which can inform future studies on human health disparities between men vs. women at different life stages. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
