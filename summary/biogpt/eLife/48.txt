 mechanisms at different steps during PTI elicitation process. This work provides mechanistic insights into plant immunity regulation via direct coupling between receptors and intracellular regulators such as kinases or phosphatases within multiprotein complexes. It also reveals novel roles played by small GTPases outside their well known function on membrane trafficking pathways. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > GTPase activating activity, innate Immunity, phosphorylation, signal transduction, ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Plants have evolved sophisticated defense systems against pathogen attacks including pattern recognition receptor- triggered immunity (PRR – TI; Jones & Dangl, 2 0 0 6 ▸). PRRs recognize conserved microbial signatures called microbe ‐ associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) leading to PAMP-induced stomatal closure, callose deposition around infection sites, transcriptional reprogramming, oxidative burst induction, mitogen activated protein kinase- dependent growth inhibition, phytoalexin biosynthesis etc. These early events collectively contribute to basal resistance which can be further enhanced upon subsequent exposure to effectors delivered inside host cells by pathogens (Boller et al., 1 9 8 5 ▶; Chisholm et al., 2 0 0 6 ▸; Zipfel et al., 2 0 0 4 ▸). To counter effector attack plants possess additional layers termed R genes encoding nucleotide binding site leucine rich repeat containing disease resistant proteins (NLR Rs) recognizing specific virulence factors produced either intra- cellularly [e.g. AvrRpm1] or extracellularly [i.e. HopA1] resulting in hypersensitive response cell death often accompanied by systemic acquired acclimation conferring robust race nonspecific broad spectrum resistances referred to as gene-for-gene interactions (Bent & Mackey, 2 0 0 7 ▸). A number of studies suggest that many NLRs form multi subunit structures where each member acts independently but cooperatively contributes towards full functionality (Takken & Tameling, 2 0 0 3 ▸; Deslandes & Staskawicz, 2 0 0 3 ▸; Maekawa et al., 2 0 1 1a < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > ▸; Qi et al., 2 0 1 1b < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > ▸). However, little information exists about whether other components besides those encoded by classical NB domain confer functional specificity toward particular targets like Avr determinants. In addition, most RLKs lack any obvious regulatory domains except some members belonging to LRR XI subfamily contain C terminal transmembrane helix suggesting possible involvement of co-activators distinct from adaptors used by animal JAK tyrosine kinases involved in cytokine signalling pathway (Shiu & Bleecker, 2 0 0 1 ▸). Therefore identification of interacting partners will help us understand not only downstream processes following ligand perception but may reveal new modes of action employed by various classes of eukaryotic surface sensors regulating diverse cellular activities ranging from development to stress adaptation. We recently reported genetic evidence indicating requirement of two closely related atypical α subunits of trimeric guanine nucleotides exchange factor (GEF) named XLG family consisting of three highly similar isoforms namely XLG3, XLG4 and XLG5 functioning redundantly upstream of plasma membrane localized GPCR component RAR1 in brassinosteroid hormone signalling.Interestingly all four xlg mutants showed compromised seedling establishment phenotypes when grown under light conditions while they were indistinguishable compared with wild type seedlings growing without daylight illumination implying role of XLGs specifically regulated by blue light.Further analysis revealed reduced sensitivity to abscisic acid treatment observed among mutant lines lacking one out of five major Gα sub units present in Arabidopsis.The results suggested existence of multiple functionally redundant Gα subtypes possibly working synergistically along with Gβγ dimers formed mainly using unconventional βγ dimer pairing involving single copy of γ1γ2 pair instead of conventional αβγ1 trimer found ubiquitously across eukaryotes (Urano et al., 2 0 1 2a < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > ▸). Our recent report demonstrated physical interaction between XLG2 and another typical Gα subtype Gαi3 acting antagonistically over ABA signalings thereby providing biochemical basis underlying antagonistic effects exhibited by individual Gαi homologs despite high sequence similarity amongst them (Pandey et al., 2 0 1 8a < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > ▸). Although our previous data indicated no apparent developmental defects displayed by loss-offunction alleles of agb1 null allele gai2 even after prolonged cultivation period, double knockout line was more sensitive than respective parental genotypes to salt stress.Similarly, triple knock down transgenic rice expressing RNAi construct targeting OsGα1 transcript resulted in increased tolerance to salinity whereas overexpression led to hypersensitivity thus confirming its negative effect on abiotic stresses (Wang et al., 2 0 1 8b < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > ▸). Taken altogether available evidences strongly support presence of several unique types of GPCRs operating independent of traditional heterotrimers comprising α- β-
