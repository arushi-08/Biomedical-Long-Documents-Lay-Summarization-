 plays important roles during development through its ability to regulate endosome dynamics which may be essential not only at developmental but also later on adult life when it becomes crucial for neuronal survival or function maintenance.

When both groups fire together their coordinated contraction produces blood flow throughout all organs within minutes after birth — before any oxygen reaches them too quickly. However some babies born with congenital abnormalities such as spina bifida do not develop properly because there was no connection between parts of brain tissue known as ‘ vertebrae ” - part of the spine responsible for controlling movement around us. As soon as people reach adulthood most individuals who had previously died suddenly now live well without having problems getting enough food into muscles needed daily activities like walking long distances. But those whose backs were damaged due to spinal cord damage often suffer serious health issues including paralysis caused by muscle weakness along nerves connecting back tissues to body structures inside the head. It remains unclear why children affected by severe forms of scoliosis sometimes survive longer compared to others despite being unable to move normally again once mature. Now researchers hope to find out if genetic differences could explain individual variations seen across patients suffering similar conditions. One gene associated specifically with abnormal movements encodes MEIS1 proteins found primarily outside nerve cell bodies where signals travel down axons towards synapses made onto nearby myocytes. Previous work suggested that loss of MEIS might affect communication pathways used by motor neuron terminals to communicate directly with surrounding skeletal muscle fibers rather then passing messages indirectly though autonomic ganglia located near each side of the central canal. Here, Duncavage et al. studied mice lacking functional copies of meis1a alone or combined with mutations affecting different aspects of vertebral formation. They discovered several changes occurring earlier in embryos carrying mutant versions of either single copy number version of meisa1 plus mutated vertebra forming regions relative to controls containing wild type levels of MEIS1A expression. Some effects persisted even beyond what would typically occur just prior to hatching suggesting possible permanent alterations occurred following exposure to reduced amounts of MEISA1B produced shortly afterwards. Further experiments revealed specific molecular mechanisms underlying observed phenotypes involving interactions between MESAS1C isoforms encoded by mesi1b transcripts expressed exclusively in developing sensory ganglion precursors and components involved in regulating vesicle transport processes required for synaptic transmission. Together, these observations indicate that defective connections formed initially between fetal motoneurons expressing high concentrations of MEIS1A1P isoform and adjacent myocyte targets result in delayed arrival times of parasympathetic inputs arriving late in embryogenesis causing subsequent delays in pacemaker firing rates resulting ultimately in arrhythmias predisposing animals exposed prenatally to low doses of radiation mimicking environmental exposures experienced accidentally sometime since Chernobyl accident in April 1 9 8 6. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Congenital malformations account for approximately half of infant deaths worldwide annually accounting for nearly three million stillbirths per year globally according to WHO estimates last updated in December 2 0 1 7 (World Health Organization [WHO], 2 0 1 7a). Spina Bifida Occurring During Pregnancy (SBOP) affects ~ 1 case per thousand pregnancies overall although incidence varies widely depending largely on geographic location (McDonald & Berry, 2 0 1 6a). While much progress toward understanding etiology contributing factors behind human disease continues apace, identifying causative variants underpinning complex traits presents significant challenges given extensive locus heterogeneity coupled with incomplete penetrance compounded further complicated by variable expressivity commonly encountered clinically. A recent study combining genome sequencing analysis alongside linkage mapping approach led to identification of novel candidate loci harboring rare deleterious alleles conferring increased risks for non syndromic familial isolated SB (FIP) segregating independently in multiple families (Moustafa et al., 2 0 1 7b).
