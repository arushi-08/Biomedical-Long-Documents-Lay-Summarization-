 replication at early S phase as well as proper localization during mitosis / meiosis I. These results suggest an additional role played by SUVH proteins beyond their canonical functions: they may act not only through H3K9me2 but also directly or indirectly with other types of epigenetic marks such as ncRNAs. Our study provides new insights into molecular mechanism underlying heterochromatic silencing mediated by suv3 family genes including human SUV3 9H1 gene itself.

Constitutive transcriptional activity occurs mainly along chromosome arms whereas induced activation usually takes place near centromeres known as facultative heterochromatins because it involves changes between transcriptionally active euchromatin and inactive condensed heterochromatin states around centromere region. Although many factors involved in regulation of euchromatic versus repressive centromeric structures have recently emerged, details remain unclear particularly when considering roles exerted specifically toward induction rather than maintenance phases since most previous analyses focused primarily on maintaining silenced status after establishment processes involving formation of repressed structure prior to initiation events occurring towards later time points post fertilization. Thus far there exists little evidence suggesting involvement of any particular factor exclusively dedicated solely to inducing repression process while leaving open questions whether certain components could play dual functional roles — one being required initially for establishing initial repressing structural features followed subsequently by subsequent contribution once those properties become established. Such possibility seems plausible given recent observations indicating existence of multiple layers controlling different aspects of cellular
