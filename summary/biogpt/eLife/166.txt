 selection for adaptive mutations; however, when conditions change (e.g. during adaptation) compensatory mechanisms can be lost through mutation leading to increased fitness without an increase in overall genetic diversity within species.

However it was not known whether similar processes occur among more distantly diverged taxa with different levels of genome stability due primarily to technical limitations associated with studying non-human genomes over long periods of time using traditional sequencing approaches. Recent advances have allowed us now access to whole eukaryotic microbial population genomics from natural environments where selective pressures vary rapidly across space and timeframes spanning thousands years [reviewed recently]. These studies reveal extensive intra-specific polymorphism resulting largely from de novo point substitutions arising via replication errors followed by purifying selections against them (Sniegowski & Gerrish, 2 0 1 0b; Tenaillon et al., 2 0 1 0a). In contrast there appears little evidence supporting widespread recurrent large scale chromosomal rearrangements including duplications and deletions occurring either spontaneously throughout life cycles or following exposure to environmental stresses like antibiotics (Fares et al., 2 0 1 3a; Zhu et al., 2 0 1 4b). This suggests that most spontaneous structural variants arise infrequently relative to single nucleotide polymorphisms making their detection difficult even if present. Nevertheless some examples do exist indicating both positive roles played by chromosome amplifications in stress resistance pathways (Chen et al., 2 0 1 1a; Dunham et al., 2 0 0 9a; Kao et al., 2 0 0 9b; Koschwanez et al., 2 0 1 3b; Pavelka et al., 2 0 1 0; Rosenberg et al., 2 0 1 2a; Rancati et al., 2 0 1 1b; Torres et al., 2 0 0 7a; Wloch et al., 2 0 0 1) and negative impacts caused by loss of heterozygosity events involving duplicated regions causing reduced growth rate compared to haploids lacking those same loci (Andersen et al., 2 0 1 2b; Deutschbauer et al., 2 0 0 5a; Kvitek & Sherlock, 2 0 0 8b; Selmecki et al., 2 0 0 6a; Szafraniec et al., 2 0 0 3c). Thus while our understanding regarding mutational drivers affecting individual alleles continues to grow steadily, much less information exists about factors influencing larger segments of DNA containing multiple functionally redundant paralogs encoding proteins involved directly in cellular function. Here we address this question focusing specifically upon segmental aneuploidies found frequently amongst Saccharomyces cerevisiae clinical isolate lineages derived independently since divergence ∼ 1 million yr ago (Figure 1A). Segmental gains result predominantly from reciprocal translocations mediated by Ty elements located near centromeres rather then being randomly distributed along all arms of each pair of homologous chromatids (Adams et al., 2 0 0 6; Bornemann et al., 2 0 0 8a; Conrad et al., 2 0 0 7b; Forche et al., 2 0 0 9; Gressens et al., 2 0 0 8; Hughes Hallett et al., 2 0 1 1; Lee et al., 2 0 1 4a; Libkind et al., 2 0 1 5b; Oza et al., 2 0 0 9; Schacherer et al., 2 0 0 8; Thomas et al., 2 0 0 6; Zaragoza et al., 2 0 1 3). While several groups reported high frequencies of aneuploid clones isolated after prolonged culturing experiments performed exclusively utilizing rich media supplemented with glucose (Burke et al., 2 0 0 0; Brown et al., 2 0 0 1; Gifford et al., 2 0 0 2; Kolodner et al., 2 0 0 6b; Lang et al., 2 0 1 3; Moriel ‐ Carretero et al., 2 0 1 0; Ruiz et al., 2 0 1 0; Smith et al., 2 0 0 4; Verstrepen et al., 2 0 0 5) others did so only rarely despite having cultured hundreds times longer cultures grown solely employing minimal medium supplements required for optimal cell proliferation (Dowell et al., 2 0 1 0c; Kondrasho
