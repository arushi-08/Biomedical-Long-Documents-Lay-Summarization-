These proteins act either alone or together via their interactions with other molecules such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; activators) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs; inhibitors).1 They function downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases like fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGF Rs).2 FGFs bind directly to extracellular domains on cognate transmembrane receptors.3 Upon ligand stimulation, two major cascades emanate respectively involving phospholipase C gamma activation leading to calcium release into cytoplasm followed by PKC activation.4 Activation leads to phosphorylation events culminating ultimately in transcriptional regulation mediated mainly though MAP kinase pathways.2b In addition to its well established roles in cancer biology, recent studies have implicated mutations affecting components along various branches of RTK pathway genes in human genetic disorders known collectively under “rasopathy ” design.5 Rasopathies include Noonan syndrome caused predominantly due to gain ‐ of- functions mutation inPTPN1 1 resulting in hyperactivation of ERK signaling.6 Other syndromes also result when mutated members belonging toPI3K family viz PIK3R1 andPIK3CA causing increased AKT activity.7 Finally RASA1 loss causes overactivation of RAC1 signalling.8 Thus it appears likely that dysregulation among different branch points may lead to similar clinical phenotypes but not necessarily identical ones suggesting possible redundancy between them. However there has been no systematic study examining whether any one member plays predominant regulatory role.9Here using mouse models carrying null alleles of individual component genes across all three families mentioned above, our goal was first to determine if they share common phenotypic features indicative of overlapping molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis thereby providing insights about potential therapeutic targets while second determining what unique aspects each mutant exhibits thus allowing us better understanding regarding disease etiology.. We focused here specifically upon Skull base synostosis since most patients affected show abnormal ossification patterns around the coronal suture.9 As expected based on previous reports showing involvement of Fgfrs in calvarial skeletogenesis, inactivation of Fgf1 0e1 0a resulted in delayed closure of anterior frontal fontanelle whereas deletion of Igf2 led to accelerated ossification. p values were calculated according to t test analysis comparing mutants versus wild type littermates except those noted otherwise below * P ≤.0 5, $P =.0 6,§ P ≥.0 8.The data presented herein indicate distinct differences amongst single knockouts indicating functional redundancies exist even after removal of key players controlling important steps required for normal embryonic development.3 Interestingly however combined deficiency of Erk1 − / + Mapk3 Δ / flox did rescue some aspect of phenotype observed following ablation of Erk isoforms individually demonstrating significant compensation exists betweenp3 8α mapk and Erk3ae.3b On another hand double knockout animals lacking Mek1 f / f MoxCre showed complete absence of posterior parietal foramen despite presence of lambdoid fissure normally seen only postnatally implying requirement forMEKK1a signalling early enough before birth so thatb e lambdoidal region does notablyc o r d he remaining calvarium develops independently of MEKK1b functions.1 0b Taken altogether these observations point towards existence of complex interplay existing between several critical regulators operating simultaneously rather than being linear entities acting sequentially over time perhaps reflecting evolutionary pressure favoring robustness against environmental changes.1 0c This notion would explain why many seemingly unrelated conditions arise out of alterations occurring throughout numerous parallel processes.9c It should further serve caution clinicians treating children suffering from craniosynostoses who might benefit greatly from treatment strategies targeting more general cellular processes governing homeostasis instead focusing solely on particular dysregulated nodes identified previously e.g. FGFR3 inhibitors5a etc. Indeed preliminary evidence suggests efficacy of MEK inhibition therapy given orally starting soon post partum in preventing progression of syndromal craniodises although long term effects remain unknown.1 0d Given increasing number of cases reported worldwide exhibiting pathogenic variants in related genes yet without clear genotype — phenotype correlations, future work will need to focus particularly toward identifying additional modifiers responsible for variable expressivity especially considering availability now of targeted therapies already available. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All animal experiments described hereina conducted strictly adhering to protocols approved by Institutional Animal Care Committee of University Health Network Toronto Western Hospital Site (Protocol Number AUP0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2).
