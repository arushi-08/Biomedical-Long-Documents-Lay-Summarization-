Our results suggest that bacteria can rapidly evolve increased mutabilities through transient increases in death probability during adaptation without changing replication fidelity (Fig. Hypermutagenesis may be beneficial for adapting new niches but also costly because it accelerates genetic drift which reduces overall adaptability Overall, while some studies have shown benefits from elevated mutational loads on long timescales It should however not come too far since even small fluctuations between low and highly mutagenic regimes could lead to significant differences in evolutionary trajectories over time As discussed above, there exists evidence suggesting that E. coli strains carrying defective mismatch repair systems exhibit lower growth yields than wild type counterparts When considering all possible explanations why hyper mutants were observed only transiently after initial exposure to alcohol, one possibility was contamination due to pre-existing variants present within non-mutagenized control samples used throughout experiments. However, none of those possibilities seem likely given similar frequencies found among other replicates exposed similarly to identical conditions except lacking any treatment. Another explanation might involve phenotypic heterogeneity amongst individual clones grown out following each round of passaging; although unlikely based upon experimental observations reported here, further work will need to explore whether subpopulations exist below detection limits before concluding otherwise. Finally, another potential source of variation would stem directly from spontaneous errors associated with PCR amplification itself rather then actual genomic alterations per se. Although rare events, they cannot fully account for discrepancies seen across replicate treatments despite accounting for random sampling effects using resampled data sets. This suggests either stochastic error arising early enough so large numbers do emerge yet remain undetected until later stages of experimentation nor does it rule them out altogether. Regardless, future investigations into molecular origins behind variable levels of hypermutation must consider both technical sources contributing noise alongside biological factors influencing variability including environmental history prior to plating onto media containing antibiotics. For example, if certain types of stressors induce more frequent genome instability compared to others remains unknown though recent literature provides hints At least two distinct pathways contribute towards generating point mutations via polymerase slippage Errors arise spontaneously primarily during lagging strand synthesis where polymerases encounter short stretches of repetitive sequences known as microsatellites Here, we report surprising plasticity in microbial genomes whereby chromosomal loci become temporarily unstable leading to temporary periods of heightened mutagenicity termed “kataegic ” activity. These dynamics occur independent of canonical MMR function allowing previously stable genotypes to acquire advantageous phenotypes quickly. Given its ubiquity and importance in shaping organismal biology, understanding causes and consequences of dynamic change in gene expression patterns requires consideration beyond static models currently employed in many fields. Indeed, several lines of investigation indicate that epigenetic modifications play important roles in regulating heritable traits Despite extensive characterization efforts investigating diverse aspects of prokaryotic genetics, little attention had been paid toward studying temporal variations in genotypic stability Over decades researchers have focused almost exclusively on identifying genes involved in maintaining accurate chromosome transmission and preventing deleterious outcomes like cancer Yet few attempts made exploring alternative modes of regulation controlling potentially harmful processes like somatic diversification < / FREETEXT > < / SECTION > ▃ ▃ < METHOD > < FREETEXT > Methods ▃ Experimental design.

Luria Broth Miller agar plates supplemented with ampicillin sodium salt solution (Sigma Aldrich) at final concentration of 1 mg mL − 1 served as solid support substrate for culturing microbes. Stock solutions prepared daily consisted of LB broth plus antibiotic added just prior inoculation at concentrations indicated earlier along with sterile deionized water serving as diluent solvent controls. Ethanol stock aliquots stored frozen comprised liquid nitrogen cooled stocks dissolved immediately preceding usage diluted appropriately in fresh culture media. qPCR assays targeting rpoB locus.
