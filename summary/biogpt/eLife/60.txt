 Can't be provided by us either: We did not record from all possible locations within our recording area or could only measure one direction per neuron; nor was it clear whether each recorded unit had multiple independent firing rates corresponding to different positions along its preferred axis as suggested previously [Nat Neurosci 9 2 7]. However, because movements can occur during natural behavior such data would seem more likely than if they occurred exclusively under experimental conditions designed specifically to study hippocampal function. The fact that similar patterns emerge when animals move freely suggests there may indeed exist common mechanisms underlying both types of motion related responses which might help explain why some researchers argue against using "real world 'tasks involving locomotion instead of simple laboratory paradigms based upon passive viewing alone. These observations suggest caution should perhaps be exercised before generalizing about cognitive functions derived solely through studies employing purely motor dependent behavioral protocols. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
