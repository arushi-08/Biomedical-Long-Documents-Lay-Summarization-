 transcription through dynamic regulation of protein stability via reversible post translational modifications (PTMs) such as phosphorylation or monoubiquitination followed by polyubiquitin chain elongation on specific substrates like NPR1. This study provides new insights into mechanisms underlying plant immunity mediated by Ubiquitin Proteasome System components. We propose an integrated model where both positive and negative regulators act together at different stages during activation phase leading up to full induction of defense responses against pathogens. Our results also suggest potential targets involved in fine tuning host defenses upon pathogen attack based on their role either positively regulating PTI signaling pathway [s] or negatively modulating basal defences. The proposed mechanism may be applicable not only to other systems involving PTM dependent changes but could have broad implications beyond innate immunity since similar regulatory strategies exist across kingdoms including animals 1 2 – 3 0. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > To investigate whether there was any evidence supporting our hypothesis regarding sequential action between K4 8 linked poly ubiqitination and subsequent K6 3- linkage extension from mono ubiquitinated form of NPR1 5 4 6 K → R mutant proteins, first immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using anti HA antibody coupled beads under denaturing conditions following transient co transfection assays expressing GFP tagged wild type Arabidopsis thaliana NPR1 along with FLAG epitope fused Ub variants: WT; K1 1R; K2 9R; K3 3R; K4 8R; K6R mutants respectively lacking one lysine residue within each respective domain except for single amino acid substitution mutation introduced specifically disrupting corresponding site without affecting overall structure of UB molecule 9. As shown previously, while all tested forms can interact equally well with NPR1 indicating no major differences among them due to lack of specificity towards particular sites, polyubiquitinated species accumulated more efficiently than monoubiquitinated ones suggesting they might serve as precursors before further conjugation events occur resulting eventually in formation of longer chains required for efficient targeting to proteasomes 9. Next, immunocomplexes obtained after immunoprecipitating endogenous NPR1 isolated from Col-0 seedlings treated with SA over time period ranging from 0 min till 4h showed accumulation pattern consistent with previous observations wherein higher molecular weight bands representing modified NPR1 appeared initially peaking around 1h then declined gradually reaching minimum level 2h later coinciding with maximum levels observed earlier i.e. 3h onwards whereas unmodified monomeric band remained relatively constant throughout treatment course Fig 1A & B upper panel lanes marked “Total ”. Interestingly however, although total amount of immunoprecipitated NPR1 did remain unchanged irrespective of treatments used here, ratio of mono- vs. polyubiqutination increased significantly starting just 6h hours apart from peak point thus implying temporal correlation exists amongst various types of ubiquitinations occurring simultaneously even though exact nature remains unknown. In order to confirm presence of multiple linkages present in high MW conjugates formed transiently expressed NPR1 samples subjected to western blot analysis employing antibodies recognizing distinct epitopes namely FK1, FK + 2, P4D1 etc. revealed existence of diverse kinds of conjugated moieties containing mainly Lys4 8- and Lys6 3-linked di-Ubs albeit some minor amounts of Lys1 1- and Lys2 9- linkaged molecules too (Supplementary Figure S1 A - D). These data indicate simultaneous occurrence of several modes of conjugtions possibly because individual lysines being available for attachment vary depending on availability of free residues hence making possible addition of additional units onto already existing polymers. However, given possibility of non canonical interactions cannot completely ruled out yet so far. Further studies will help us understand precise details about kinetics behind multi mode interaction dynamics taking place inside cells. Nevertheless, taken collectively above experimental evidences support notion that besides acting directly downstream of receptor kinases activated upstream of NPR1.S complex, UPS machinery acts indirectly controlling activity status of key players governing PR response probably functioning independently rather than sequentially adding successive layers of complexity once initiated. It should therefore come forth important question why does cellular system need such elaborate control strategy instead of relying solely on simple linear cascade driven signal transduction pathways operating outside cell nucleus? One plausible explanation lies perhaps in necessity to prevent inadvertent triggering of inappropriate defensive reactions especially those directed toward self tissues e.g. constitutive production of antimicrobial compounds causing autoimmunity known as autoimmune syndrome often seen in many cases having defects related to PRR complexes themselves etc.. Another intriguing aspect raised immediately relates to evolutionary advantage conferred by requirement of tight spatio-temporally controlled regulations imposed by UPS itself. For example, recent reports demonstrate involvement of SCF TIR1 -Aux / IAA auxin signalling module in mediating crosstalk between jasmonic acid- ethylene hormone family members whereby JA induces EIN3a transcript abundance independent of direct binding ability of JAZ repressors to DNA elements located near promoter region responsible for activating ET responsive element (ERE) found therein 3 1.Therefore, considering importance of proper timing achieved by UPS component's function would certainly benefit survival fitness of organisms exposed constantly changing environment particularly biotic stress factors encountered frequently enough to trigger rapid adaptive change. Finally, despite extensive efforts made recently trying to identify novel interactors interacting partners of NPR1 5 4 6K Lys → Arg variant carrying mutations abolishing putative ubiquitylation sites nevertheless none has been identified until now leaving open questions pertaining functional significance of seemingly stable posttranslational modifi cations reported herein. Future work aimed at identifying bona fide substrate candidates whose fate depends primarily on differential patterns of multimodi cation described herein--likely represent prime candidate
