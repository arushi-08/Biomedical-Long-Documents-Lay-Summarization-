 modes during helix formation (Figure 1). This work provides new insights into bacterial morphogenesis through quantitative imaging analyses combined with genetic approaches designed specifically toward understanding complex cellular processes such as helicoidal morphology generation within an intact host environment. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
