 period promotes immune homeostasis by preventing excessive mucosal responses against commensal microbes after colonization has been established through an adaptive response driven primarily by T cells at later stages of postnatal maturation. Our data suggest potential therapeutic strategies for infants who have mutations affecting IL1 0RA or other genes involved in innate immunity pathways such as NOD2 / CARD1 5: they may benefit from interventions aimed either at reducing bacterial load prior to introduction into solid foods [e.g. antibiotics]; enhancing IL1R activity following exposure to food antigens via oral administration of recombinant IL 1 8 protein which can be given orally without causing systemic side effects – see also below paragraph “Targeting Innate Immunity ” section above}; promoting regulatory mechanisms involving dendritic cell subsets expressing high levels of CD1 1c + MHCII hi molecules but low amounts of CD8 6 surface markers (so called" tolerogenic DCs' "…... recently described populations derived from human monocytes cultured under specific conditions - see next chapter about monocyte differentiation protocols used here.. In addition our study suggests caution when considering therapies targeting myeloid lineage cells since their manipulation could potentially exacerbate chronic gut diseases like IBD if administered too late postnatally before establishment of normal host defense functions had occurred. This possibility should therefore always be considered along with any proposed treatment strategy based upon modulation of innate lymphoid cells.Please note however that there was no evidence supporting increased susceptibility towards infection associated with loss of Il1r expression nor were differences observed between WT vs. Il1 0- / -.Cd4 5ra − / − animals regarding CD4 positive lymphocyte numbers within mesenteric lymph nodes suggesting overall intact cellular defenses despite lack of functional Tregs due to defective production of immunosuppressive cytokines including TGF beta 2 3 9 7. The authors conclude that impaired control over local tissue damage caused by dysregulated cytokine secretion leads ultimately to severe immunopathology resulting in premature death. While it remains unclear why some individuals succumb prematurely whereas others do well beyond one year old, perhaps because different genetic backgrounds influence severity rather than timing of presentation. Alternatively, environmental factors might contribute significantly to outcome independent of genotype. For example dietary components known to affect gastrointestinal tract integrity include fiber content, presence of pathogens etc. It will thus important going forward to determine what aspects of diet impact outcomes among affected patients. If indeed distinct genotypes lead to more rapid progression then targeted therapy directed toward particular gene products would likely prove beneficial even though underlying molecular causes remain elusive. A recent report describes successful use of anti TNF alpha antibodies in treating refractory Crohn's Disease in children aged less than three years indicating efficacy regardless of age group. Thus far only limited information exists concerning long term safety issues related to using biologics in young pediatric subjects compared to adults treated similarly. Therefore further studies examining both short- and longtime consequences of blocking pro-inflammatorymediators especially those implicated in regulating epithelial barrier permeability across mucosa lining intestine wall need to take place. Finally additional work needs tow out understanding how disruption of key immunoregulatory circuits contributes mechanistically to pathogenesis leading up to clinical symptoms seen in humans carrying deleterious variants identified herein. Such knowledge promises new insights into novel approaches designed to treat disorders characterized by inappropriate activation of proinflammatory cascades triggered downstream of pattern recognition receptors expressed predominantly by mononuclear phagocytes. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Human genetics provides powerful tools enabling us to identify critical regulators controlling immunological processes essential for maintaining health throughout lifespan. We highlight several examples where monogenic forms of primary immunodeficiency syndromes inform basic immunology concepts governing pathogen sensing, effector molecule deployment programs employed by leukocytes engaged productively in combating infections versus ones mediating collateral injury inflicted inadvertently by invading microorganisms. Further characterization ofbiological roles played byindividual proteins encoded by candidate PID loci invites exploration forfuture translational applications aiming to harness natural protective barriers afforded by antimicrobial effectors deployed locally amidst complex communities harboring diverse resident microflora andpathogenic invaders alike. Moreover identification of causal relationships betweeninherited immunodeficiencies and autoimmune phenotypes offers opportunities to better understand immunopathogenesis contributing to common multifactorial illnesses whose etiology cannot yet confidently attributed solely onfamilial inheritance patterns alone. As highlighted previously many PIDs exhibit variable expressivity making them difficult candidates for traditional linkage analysis techniques applied heretofore to map causative alleles responsible for Mendelian traits. Recent advances made possible by whole genome sequencing promise improved resolution offamilial transmission mapping efforts thereby facilitating discovery of rare sequence variations accounting for sporadic cases of otherwise genetically unexplained autoimmunity. With respect to identifying risk factorspredisposing certain groups of people to developing infectious complications secondary to immunosuppression post transplantation, progress isbeing achieved rapidly thanks largely to application of NGS technologies coupled withbioinformatic analyses allowing prediction of putative damaging missense changes segregating exclusively amongst case cohorts relative to controls. Identification of functionally significant polymorphisms linked to adverse drug reactions represents another area ripe for investigation facilitated by similar technological advancements now available. Although much still awaits elucidation, current developments offer hope that--once fully understook--the full spectrum of heritable variation influencing predisposition to various types of illness ranging fromsingle nucleotide substitutions conferring subtle alterations in biochemical properties of proteinsand copy number variations--large structural rearrangements encompassing entire chromosomes -- can soon become accessible diagnostically and therapeutically tractable targets amenable to personalized medicine tailored according to each patient ’ s
