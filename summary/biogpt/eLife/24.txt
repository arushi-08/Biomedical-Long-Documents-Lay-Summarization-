 brain function during early infancy when cognitive abilities first develop. These results suggest novel approaches toward understanding human neurodevelopmental disorders associated with abnormal neuronal synchrony or network dysfunction such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Significance statement: Neural circuits undergo rapid maturation from birth through adolescence into adulthood; however it has been unclear whether specific periods exist where functional properties change most dramatically within developing brains. Here we show evidence supporting emergence of adult features on multiple scales including local circuit dynamics, global connectivity structure, spike timing precision, and intrinsic firing rate profiles between 1 0 days before term age until 2 weeks postnatally in both mouse cortex and infant monkey prefrontal cortices. This suggests there may indeed be critical windows around 3 months postconception / 6 years old for optimal functioning of primate frontal lobe circuitry involved in higher order executive control tasks like working memory. Our study provides new insights about normal maturational changes occurring over several key milestones along neurodevelopment leading up to full maturity while also providing insight regarding potential mechanisms underlying atypical behavior seen among children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) who have deficits related to social communication skills. Understanding what happens normally throughout childhood will help us understand why some individuals fail to reach their expected level of performance despite seemingly appropriate intervention strategies whereas others do not respond well enough even though they receive intensive treatment programs designed specifically targeting core symptoms of autistic behaviors. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
