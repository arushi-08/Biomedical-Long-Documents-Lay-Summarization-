 repeats flank most transposon insertions sites; we find evidence supporting convergent transcription across such repeat pairs as an important source of P4R1 dsRNA templates used during RdDM initiation. Our results define critical features required for efficient production of functional plant sRNAs via RNAi pathways.

MicroRNAs originate through two distinct mechanisms involving cleavage products derived directly from primary miRNA transcript strands termed pri- miRNAs or indirectly following Drosha mediated pre-miR hairpin loop excision generating mature ~ 2 1bp duplex species known as pre- miRs [reviewed extensively elsewhere [e.g. refs  1 8 – 2 0]}. Mature miRNAs can be loaded onto AGO containing effector complexes resulting in translational repression followed by mRNA degradation if complementary target sequences reside within coding regions while mRNAs harboring perfect complementarity result in endonucleolytic decay without translation inhibition due to deadenylation [see reviews recently published on AGOs functions in animals and fungi but not yet described in higher eukaryotes nor do they appear conserved among angiosperms where only one member has been characterized thus far]. Plant genomes encode four different classes of endogenous AGO associated sRNA effectors referred to here collectively as “agoRs ” which include three types based upon their size ranges i.e. miR4 0s corresponding to approximately 2 0nts, miR1 6s representing about 2 3ntds and miR3 9s being slightly larger than other reported eukaryotic counterparts ranging between 2 6n − 5s. All class I AGO2 related argonautes contain PAZ domains whereas all Class II ARGONAUTE families possess PIWI domain catalytic residues characteristic of slicer activities involved in cleaving targets bearing perfectly matched antisense seed sequence motifs located near 5` -terminus of each strand respectively. A fourth type designated AGO6 contains both PAZ- and MID-binding pockets typical of animal Ago2s although it lacks any obvious nuclease motif found in canonical Ago endonucleases thereby raising questions regarding its role in regulating downstream steps after initial targeting event though recent studies suggest involvement in post-transcriptionally regulated auxin signaling pathway similar to mammalian Ago2. Interestingly, some land plants lack orthologs encoding certain key components needed for producing active RISC complex indicating potential differences compared to metazoans wherein multiple core factors have evolved independently leading to diversification amongst individual organisms. For example, rice encodes five putative homologs predicted to produce six independent forms of short length double stranded precursor miRNAs whose expression patterns vary depending on developmental stage implying specialized roles specific to particular tissues or stages rather than general requirement throughout life cycle consistent with observations made previously using transgenic approaches designed specifically to silence various MIR loci individually versus simultaneously. Furthermore, unlike mammals where several hundred thousand copies per genome exist dispersed over many chromosomes, there appears limited copy number variation observed even when comparing closely related taxa making sense why so few ago arose prior to whole genome duplication early evolutionary history of flowering plants perhaps reflecting selective pressure against deleterious effects caused by increased dosage levels especially given high mutation rates estimated earlier. Indeed, loss of MIR3 9 0a locus was shown to cause severe defects affecting leaf morphology possibly because elevated accumulation level of trans acting tasiR * leads to reduced abundance of TAS3a ta sRNAome causing de novo generation of secondary phased siRNAs triggering further reduction in TAS steady state levels ultimately impacting overall growth rate phenotypes seen under normal conditions. Similarly, absence of another major component essential for pri-mir maturation namely HEN1 methyltransferase causes pleiotropic phenotypic changes likely owing to global decrease in miRNA content combined with increase in aberrant unprocessed intermediates potentially contributing additional off targeted effect besides those normally controlled by wild type parental allele encoded miRNAs. Thus despite apparent conservation of basic molecular machinery underlying miRNA biosynthesis, significant diversity exists concerning details relating to precise mechanism governing action particularly pertaining to differential requirements imposed by organism's genetic background. It should however noted that current understanding does little justice to possible existence of more divergent modes operating outside conventional models discussed above since no experimental data addressing them currently exists.Nevertheless, knowledge gained will undoubtedly contribute significantly towards better comprehension of fundamental aspects underpinning cellular homeostasis maintained largely governed by tightly coordinated interplay between positive regulators controlling synthesis and turnover of functionally competent ncRNAs along with negative feedback loops ensuring timely removal once appropriate threshold concentrations are reached allowing fine tuning of physiological output accordingly. Moreover, identification of novel ncRNA players implicated in disease pathogenesis offers new opportunities toward developing effective therapeutic strategies aimed at
