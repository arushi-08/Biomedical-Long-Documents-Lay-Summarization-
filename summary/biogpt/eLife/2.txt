 drug doses given at intervals during long dry seasons when there may not have been sufficient time for reinfection by mosquitoes that had fed on people who were already re-infected. www.nature.com / scientificreports / This work provides an important step towards understanding why certain patients do suffer multiple malaria episodes while others remain asymptomatic despite repeated exposure; we show here what happens if one dose fails due to poor compliance leading to high levels of residual parasite load remaining between treatments which can trigger reactivation events even though they might otherwise go undetected clinically. Our results suggest potential benefits associated with intermittent screening using rapid diagnostic tests combined with targeted mass administration campaigns where appropriate medicines could reduce both clinical disease burden caused directly via active parasitaemia but also indirectly reducing onward human infective mosquito bites thereby preventing further spread across populations. ▃ In addition our modelling framework allows us to explore alternative strategies involving different combinations of interventions targeting all three key processes: 1) gametocyte carriage 2) asexual erythrocytic growth 3) hepatic schizogony 4) hypnozoitosis 5) pre-symptomatic immunity 6) vector control 7) radical cure 8) post infectious prophylaxis 9) seasonal variation … These models will help inform policy makers about optimal intervention packages required to achieve elimination goals based upon realistic assumptions regarding local epidemiology including heterogeneity among patient groups defined according their age group, sex etc.. Furthermore since most countries now move away from artemisinin combination therapy use, future studies should consider whether other novel therapies currently under development would still offer similar advantages compared to current standard care approaches used today. For example recent advances include testing artemether lufentrine fixed dosage tablets alongside existing artesunate plus amodiaquine formulations. Such trials need careful consideration before moving forward because any changes made must ensure adequate safety profiles whilst maintaining efficacy so far proven effective. Finally although only considered herein specifically related to P. falciparum, the same approach applied elsewhere has implications beyond malariae.It was recently shown that non-transmissible sexual forms exist outside humans suggesting opportunities for cross species transmission.Please see SI section "Model formulation & parameterisation - Liver Stage Parasite Dynamics -Transmission Models' for full details. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ ▃ < SECTION > < FREETEXT > Modelling methods ▃ Mathematical modeling frameworks. A detailed description of each individual component included in the multi-scale epidemiological simulation model described below follows. First level dynamics. Within hosts, two types of hepatocytes emerge depending on previous exposures to sporozoites released either naturally or artificially e.g. injection of irradiated sporozoite vaccine. Susceptible cells become activated to produce merozoites capable of infecting red cell precursors resulting in ring shaped trophozoites producing immature segmented rings until mature segmentaed schizonts release daughter merozoites ready to infect fresh erythrocytes. Mature segmented schizont form then undergo maturation releasing free merozoites able to invade reticulocytes forming young circulating male gametes followed later days afterwards by female gamete production giving rise to oocysts containing thousands of zygotes surrounded by oocyst wall material. Oocysts hatch out generating motile ookinetes invading midgut epithelial tissue eventually developing invasive exo-sporulated macrogamy (xo mg). Exported exospores attach themselves onto microvilli lining gut epithelium initiating sporogonial division yielding hundreds of secondary spores ultimately maturing inside salivary glands prior being excreted back into saliva Once fully matured, sporozoites travel along migratory paths traversing several tissues reaching lymph nodes draining sites previously exposed to sporozoites i.e. skin, spleen, bone marrow etc. thus establishing lifelong chronic reservoirs. Second level population dynamic interactions. At every round of invasion newly formed merozoites enter susceptible hepatocyte pools undergoing replication cycles creating additional numbers of dormant hypnozoites. Each day approximately 0. 5% -1% of total available naïve T lymphocytes differentiate into effector memory CD4 + helper type I phenotype secreting interferon gamma (IFN γ) known collectively as Th1effectors Cells responding to antigen stimulation secrete interleukin -2 (IL − 2) Interleukin -4 (IL4) Transforming Growth Factor β (TGFβ) Tumour Necrosis factor α (TNFα) Interferon regulatory factors IRF family members play crucial roles regulating Th1 responses whereas IRF4 regulates Th2 differentiation. Regulatory cytokines IL1 0RA inhibits IFNγ secretion promoting TH2 response Conversely TH1 mediated immune protection requires CD8 cytotoxic activity driven primarily by perforin expression allowing destruction of intracellular pathogens like Toxoplasma gondii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Cytotoxic function depends largely on granzyme B produced mainly by NK cells.However dendritic derived Granzyme K plays significant role too. Dendritic Cell Derived Perforins promote DC migration to regional Lymph Nodes inducing proliferation of naive T Lymphocytes expressing cognate receptors specific for MHC class II molecules presented on DCs surface triggering clonal expansion of pathogen reactive T Helper Type I. Activated CTLs kill target cells presenting antigens recognized by TCR recognizing peptide fragments bound to MHCI molecule expressed exclusively on APCs membrane. CTL cytotoxicity involves granule exocytosis delivering perforin- granzymes complexes together with Fas ligand binding FAS receptor present on targets surfaces activating caspase cascade finally executing apoptosis. Natural killer cells express inhibitory KIR ligands HLA C * Bw4C8 allele conferring resistance to HIV Infection rates depend strongly on number of repeat units contained in VNTR region upstream promoter sequence controlling transcription efficiency of gene encoding Duffy Antigen Receptor for Chemokines (
