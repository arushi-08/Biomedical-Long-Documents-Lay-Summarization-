 machines like SWI / SNF or RSC. We propose that Mot1p uses its ATPase activity for both local unfolding at promoters by disrupting specific contacts between promoter elements and general factors while simultaneously promoting global changes within chromatin through disruption of higher order structures formed during transcriptional activation. These results highlight similarities among different classes of nucleic acid chaperones including those involved in gene regulation.
