 book chapter for understanding ion channels: 'The expanding gate can be made smaller or larger than expected from static images … but it must not change its shape "(Karpen et al. 2 0 1 5).

Briefly, point mutants containing single reactive Cys substitutions were created either individually or sequentially in rat P2X2R cDNA cloned into pcDNA3 vector background using QuikChange Lightning Site Directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies Inc. Santa Clara CA USA). All mutant cDNAs sequences were confirmed before transfection experiments. HEK cells stably expressing wild type rP2X7R were cultured under selection pressure provided by G4 1 8S. cRNA was transcribed off linearized plasmid DNA template encoding WT P2X7 R -eYFP fusion construct using mMessage Machine T7 Ultra Kit (Ambion Life technologies Grand Island NY USA) followed by purification using RNeasy Mini Spin Columns (Qiagen Valencia California USA). Xenopus laevis oocytes purchased from Ecocyte Bioscience US LLC Corvallis OR USA were injected intranuclearly with 4 ng RNA per oocyte coding for either WT or mutated forms of human hP2RX7 gene fused C terminal YFP tag. Oocytes were incubated overnight prior recording until they reached stage V - VI maturation after which recordings took place inside out configuration. Recording electrodes had resistances ranging from ~ 1MΩ when filled with 3M KCl solution. Membrane potential values reported throughout text refer to those recorded immediately preceding superfusate exchange unless otherwise noted. For all electrophysiological assays except disulfide trapping experiment described below, solutions contained Ca + free Ringer's buffer consisting of NaCl [1 1 5mM], HEPES pH = 7. 4 adjusted with NaOH} supplemented with 1mM MgCl2 and 3mM EGTA while 2MeSADP ribose stock concentration varied depending on experimental conditions. Solutions applied directly onto excised patches consisted of NMDG Cl Buffer Solution composed of NMDGOH [2M], MES pH6. 0,Tris Base pH9.HCl Adjusted with LiOH.H2O] plus various concentrations of CaCl2 and EDTA added fresh daily just prior to experimentation. Stock solutions of MTSET reagent dissolved freshly every day in DMSO then diluted appropriately so final volume did no exceed less than.5% v / v. Disulfide bond formation assay performed similarly to previous reports Whole cell currents elicited by bath perfusion of agonists measured continuously using Axopatch 1D amplifier controlled by pClamp software version 1 0. Data analysis was done offline using Clampfit ver. 1 0 program suite Molecular dynamics simulations started from homology model built previously Using GROMACS package MD simulation trajectories obtained above were analyzed first looking specifically at backbone root mean square deviation fluctuations calculated against starting coordinates. Root Mean Square Fluctuations plots shown represent average RMSF value computed around Cα atoms averaged over last 5nsec trajectory frames. Principal component analyses were carried out using g covar module implemented in gromacsv5. 1.1 code set up similar way as mentioned earlier. Clustering algorithm employed was hierarchical clustering method using complete linkage criterion. A cutoff radius r c equal to.2 nm was chosen initially resulting in grouping clusters having more similarity amongst themselves rather than being separated apart like other methods commonly adopted in literature. Further increase in cluster size resulted in significant loss of diversity observed in PCA plot suggesting large number of groups should be considered if possible. Plots showing time evolution of RMSD versus Rg plotted separately showed very little variation indicating overall stability of system even though some degree of flexibility exists especially in loop regions. Hydrogen bonds formed between pairs of heavy atom belonging to selected pair wise combinations of sidechains involved in salt bridges identified manually inspecting snapshots taken regularly intervals during production runs. Salt bridge occupancy frequency defined as percentage ratio of frame numbers corresponding to occurrence of hydrogen bonding interaction divided total amount of snapshot collected till completion of run i.e. approximately 4µseconds long.
