 disease characterized clinically as progressive muscle weakness due to loss or dysfunction of upper & lower motoneurons [1 – 3]. The pathological hallmark for diagnosis has been identified pathologically at autopsy: “Bunina bodies ” which appear eosinophilic on hematoxylin eosin staining but stain positive when stained using silver stains such as Bielschowsky ’ s method; ubiquitin immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions within spinal cord anterior horn cells called" skein like structures »; hyaline conglomerate inclusion containing phosphorylated TDP 4 3protein aggregates found throughout affected regions including cortex, brainstem nuclei and cerebellum [5 – 7]. In addition there have also recently emerged reports describing neurofilament accumulation around neuronal cell somas suggesting cytoskeletal abnormalities may be involved in pathogenesis. While most cases occur sporadically without known genetic linkage evidence, mutations affecting several genes associated with familial forms exist e.g. SOD1, FUS / TLS, TARDBP etc.. Mutations involving superoxide dismutase I gene account for approximately 2 0% of all inherited amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (fALS) patients worldwide while other causative loci include C9ORF7 2HRE, VCP, UBQLN2 ….It was originally thought that motoneuron death occurred through apoptosis mediated via caspase activation leading directly to destruction of cellular components thereby causing rapid paralysis followed inevitably by respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation support. However recent studies suggest alternative mechanisms might underlie neurodegeneration during progression of sporadic ALS where non-apoptotic pathways could play important roles particularly those related to mitochondrial function and oxidative stress responses. A number of hypotheses regarding potential pathogenic processes underlying selective vulnerability were proposed based upon observations made post mortem however none can explain why specific populations of vulnerable neurones die whereas others survive despite similar exposure to putative toxic agents i.e. they do not exhibit any intrinsic susceptibility towards toxicity per se. This suggests involvement either environmental influences acting locally along defined anatomical routes between target tissue sites and dying neurone population or local interactions occurring among multiple interacting elements both inside and outside CNS tissues themselves. There appears little doubt about some role played by glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) signalling pathway since its deletion leads selectively to motoneuronal demise whilst overexpression protects against mutant SOD induced pathology. Furthermore transgenic expression under control of astrocyte promoter GFAP resulted only partial protection indicating additional contributions arising downstream of astrocytes likely contribute significantly to overall survival outcomes following injury. Recent work indicates that skeletal muscles express high levels of trophic molecules capable of protecting neighbouring MNs thus providing further clues into possible protective effects exerted by peripheral targets. Whilst many previous investigations focused primarily on examining MN morphology after axotomy paradigms, less attention had focussed specifically on changes taking place before overt signs of axon terminal disconnection became apparent e.g.. Thus far no study examined pre symptomatic stages although one report described morphological alterations preceding frank axonopathy observed two months later. Here we present data showing detailed analysis of individual nerve terminals innervating hindlimb extensor digitorum longus (EDL) fibres longitudinally across time points spanning presymptomatic up until late stage disease onset in G9 3A hSOD1 mouse model of human ALS.Our aim here was firstly to determine if initial synaptic disassembly occurs simultaneously amongst different groups of endplates then secondly examine patterns of reinnervation subsequent to each episode of retraction. To achieve our aims longitudinal whole mount preparations allowing simultaneous visualization of entire sets of innervated synapses would allow us to investigate temporal dynamics of pre- and postsynaptic structural remodelling accompanying functional deficits seen previously. Finally given growing interest surrounding retrograde transport defects in neurodegenerative diseases especially models linked to mutation in microtubule binding proteins, namely dynein light chain 8 (Dync1L8m + / −) and dynactin p1 50Glued subunit (Dctn1 Looptail allele - gt1 9 6), we investigated anterograde trafficking properties of sciatic nerves supplying fast twitch fatigable type IIB fibers compared to slow fatigue resistant IIA fibre types expressing distinct myosin heavy chains (MHC II isoforms).The rationale behind studying presynaptic structure comes partly because impaired intracellular vesicular traffic plays key pathogenetic aspects contributing to altered neurotransmitter release characteristics often reported in animal models mimicking features characteristic of ALS. For example reduced quantal content indicative of decreased transmitter secretion coupled with increased frequency facilitation reflecting enhanced probability of vesicle fusion has already begun well ahead of clinical symptoms in rat overexpressing mutated Cu\ Zn Superoxide Dismutase enzyme (mSod1.G3 7A).This paper describes novel insights gained concerning normal development of intact adult mammalian neuromuscular junction architecture together with aberrant rewiring phenomena evident even earlier in life. Specifically we describe significant differences emerging very soon after birth whereby newly formed sprouts sprout off existing parent fiber endings forming transient connections alongside denervated ones eventually re-establishing stable contacts once again giving rise to highly branched networks reminiscent of mature wild typeanimals. Such transitory connectivity pattern contrasts sharply with what happens postnatally in healthy controls wherein reinnervating boutons form permanent associations with original endplate locations hence maintaining long term stability. Interestingly though, unlike postnatal maturation, immature WT NMJs display greater plasticity enabling them rapidly adapting so as to maintain appropriate functionality regardless changing conditions encountered perinatally. Indeed, abnormal persistence of embryonic polysialylated neural adhesion molecule PSA NCAM expressed transiently just proximal to developing nascent cholinergic inputs correlates strongly with poor outcome prognosis in humans suffering from various neurological disorders ranging from1 year old children down till adulthood. Moreover, experimental manipulation targeting removal of PSA NCAM
