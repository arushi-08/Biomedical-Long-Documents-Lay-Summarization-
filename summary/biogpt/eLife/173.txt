 program required for establishment of latent infections through modulation of cellular gene expression programs involved directly or indirectly in regulating mitochondria function. These results suggest novel therapeutic strategies targeting both host pathways as well as specific virally encoded proteins may be necessary if effective control measures against cancer associated viruses like KSHV need to emerge.

In addition many pathogens encode factors capable of modulating key signaling cascades important not only at initial stages but also throughout persistent life cycle phases leading eventually toward malignancy. For example, Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus encodes multiple functions designed specifically towards evasion of innate immunity allowing efficient replication while simultaneously avoiding detection via adaptive responses mediated primarily though CD8 + cytotoxic effector memory CD4 5RO − CCR7 lo CD6 2L hi CD2 8null “central ” -like memory phenotype T helper type I subset differentiation events occurring late following primary exposure. Similarly hepatitis C Virus has been shown recently to induce IL-1β production thereby promoting expansion of regulatory FoxP3 expressing Tregs whereas HIV promotes Treg induction among naïve Th precursors thus preventing Th1 polarization favoring Th2 dominance over Th1predominance seen later upon resolution of acute viremia suggesting potential roles played by different subsets of latently expressed miRNAs controlling distinct aspects of pathogenesis induced by each individual retrovirus species. Thus far no single factor appears sufficient alone to account fully for all features observed clinically even when considering combinations thereof underscoring likely contributions made collectively rather than individually depending largely on stage of progression being examined. Indeed recent studies using whole genome sequencing approaches indicate there exist numerous genetic alterations present across tumor genomes making them difficult targets amenable to therapy once they arise due mostly to selection pressures exerted initially prior to treatment initiation. It will therefore become increasingly more imperative now to understand molecular details underlying pathogenic processes operating under conditions where tumors develop without any overt signs suggestive of ongoing active retroviral activity given increasing evidence linking retroviruses themselves playing direct causal roles in some forms of malignancies arising spontaneously independent of other known risk agents e.g. Hepatitis C. As part of our efforts aimed here identifying additional ways whereby herpesviruses might contribute mechanistically to lymphomagenesis we focused first on defining changes taking place very soon post de novo infection since most previous work had relied heavily on established lymphoblastoid lines derived years earlier representing transformed counterparts generated decades ago ex vivo based solely on continuous culture protocols involving stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes exposed previously to exogenous mitogens i.e. phytohemagglutinin plus interleukin-2 followed by outgrowth assays performed weeks thereafter. Our goal was then twofold — firstly identify those molecules responsible functionally contributing earliest possible along the path taken so crucial steps could potentially lead finally onto malignant transformation especially because few reports were available describing functional consequences attributable exclusively to newly acquired mutations introduced subsequent to immortalization itself. Secondly determine whether similar patterns would hold true irrespective of time point chosen reflecting differences existing inherent stochastically amongst populations obtained originally immediately postinfection versus ones maintained continuously cultured subsequently until reaching crisis phase characterized mainly by massive loss of viability accompanied often by spontaneous reactivation episodes rendering cultures unusable again unless rescued artificially. To address these questions we took advantage of two systems developed independently one utilizing freshly isolated resting PBMCs stimulated shortly afterwards with infectious supernatants containing live virions produced naturally by Akata Burkitt Lymphoma line carrying endogenous Type II EBV episomes encoding EBNA2, EBNA LP, EBNA1, EBERs and BARTs together termed EREBCs providing us access temporally spanning three major points relative to onset of productive lytic cycles namely i) just hours p.i. ii) days p.ie. iii) day s.i. Here we report identification of significant temporal shifts in intrinsic properties governing susceptibility to programmed death exhibited by normal donor PBMC subpopulations undergoing immediate vs. delayed LCL formation respectively driven predominantly by differential activities displayed by the same set of multifunctional nuclear antigens designated EBNAs3a & 3b whose presence correlates closely with emergence of LCLs displaying typical characteristics consistent with bona fide proliferating lymphoblasts harboring stably integrated episomal EBV DNA sequences referred hereafter simply as LCLs. mRNA microarray analysis revealed striking similarities particularly evident regarding up regulated anti-proliferative transcripts characteristic of quiescent G0 state coupled with down modulated pro-mitogenic signals indicative of activated G1 → S transitions culminating overall in acquisition of phenotypes resembling rapidly dividing pre-GC centroblasts found normally residing transiently around germinal centers formed secondary lymphoid structures located strategically positioned near sites of antigen encounter initiating humoral antibody class switching reactions essential for generation of high affinity antibodies directed principally against foreign immunogens encountered outside circulation milieu.
