 than did their progeny after injury or genetic ablation; however, both populations required p5 3 signaling during recovery from radiation damage. Thus, we identify two distinct types of self-renewing progenitors within neurogenic niches that differ markedly at molecular level yet share similar functional properties: one type generates rapidly dividing transient amplifying progenitor daughter cells while another produces slowly cycling multipotent transit-amplification lineage restricted precursors capable of robust regeneration following acute insults such as chemotherapy treatment.

However, it has been difficult to distinguish whether proliferating neuroblasts arise directly from resident radial glial stem cells versus indirectly from other sources including local tissue turnover where they undergo rapid expansion before becoming terminally differentiated into mature glia. Here, using multicolor clonal analysis combined with inducible Cre recombinase expression driven either embryonically or postnatally along specific pathways involved in neurogenesis, we show definitively separate slow cycle NG2 + oligodendrocyte premyelinating oligodendrocytes from fast proliferative glioblasts derived primarily from ependymal lining epithelium which generate astrocytes rather then oligodendrocytic fates upon differentiation. These results suggest an unexpected degree of plasticity among neuroepithelial derivatives whose relative contributions may vary depending on environmental cues encountered over time. This work also provides insight regarding mechanisms underlying cancer recurrence post therapy when tumor suppressors like TP5 3INP1 become inactivated leading to uncontrolled growth despite cytotoxic treatments targeting DNA replication stress responses.

Lang et al. Neurogenesis requires direct activation of canonical Wnt pathway transcription factors TCF / LEF downstream of β catenin binding whereas Notch promotes astrocytogenesis instead. Neuron Deathawarde et al. showed that loss of adenomatous polyposis coli gene APC leads to nuclear accumulation of active beta Catenin resulting in increased numbers of early born cortical neuron subtypes expressing Tbr2- Early generated intermediate progenitors express high levels of proneural genes Ngn1- Intermediate produced immature newborn neuronsLow birth rate late stage neurogenesis- Late onset terminal differentiationHigh survival rates after chemotherapy- Glioblastoma multiforme tumors contain heterogeneous mixtures of glioma propagating cells- Progenitor subpopulations can be targeted selectively if necessary Based on our data showing different roles played out by each population in response to genotoxic insult, future studies should focus more closely on understanding differences inherent amongst them so therapeutic strategies designed specifically against glioblastoma might better target those responsible for disease progression. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
