 network architecture underlying cellular organization. This study provides an example where adaptation is driven primarily through changes within specific protein-interaction networks rather than large scale rewiring or duplication events as has been previously suggested (Waddington 2 0 1 3).IMPORTANCE The ability of living systems to adapt quickly when challenged by environmental change remains one of biology ’ s most mysterious aspects: How do they survive long periods off optimal conditions while maintaining functionality over time? One hypothesis suggests that robustness arises from redundancy among genes encoding functionally related molecules; however we find no evidence supporting such widespread conservation across species even though many essential processes have multiple redundant pathways leading up to them. Instead our data support models whereby key adaptations occur via small numbers of critical nodes acting cooperatively on larger groups of interacting partners. These observations may help explain why some cancers develop resistance against drugs targeting single pathway members despite having intact copies of other similar targets. In addition, because cancer treatments often target only part of complex signaling cascades it will also likely require more detailed knowledge about individual interactions before effective therapies could emerge. Finally, since yeast shares much less genetic similarity with humans compared to bacteria, understanding its response mechanisms should aid efforts toward developing new antibiotics based upon inhibiting bacterial growth machinery instead focusing solely on killing pathogens directly using antimicrobials like those used here. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
