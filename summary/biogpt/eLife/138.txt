 mechanism may be involved during neurotransmitter cycling between neurons and their surrounding supporting tissues such as lamina or photoreceptor terminals within ommatidia. Our study also provides an important resource on understanding mechanisms underlying neuronal – non neuron communication through metabolite transport across cellular membranes using transporters with broad substrate specificity like BalaT. genesis 5 4: 3 1 7 ‑ 3 2 6, August 2 0 1 8 © Wiley Periodicals Inc.

To maintain high rates of vesicle turnover under conditions where there might otherwise not have been enough available intracellular energy stores, several alternative sources must exist beyond glucose oxidation alone. One possible source could involve metabolites derived directly from other types of brain tissue itself — e.g. astrocytes can produce lactate while simultaneously taking up glutamine released form glutamatergic synapses onto nearby GABAergic interneurons (Pellerin & Magistrelli, 2 0 0 7a, b). Another possibility involves intercellular signaling molecules produced outside neural circuits themselves rather than being secreted locally inside them. For example, ATP has long served as one type of gliotransmitter molecule mediating fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials mediated primarily though ionotropic P2X receptors located postsynaptically throughout central nervous systems (Khakh et al., 2 0 1 5). However, recent studies indicate another potential candidate mediator of purinergic signalling involving adenosine triphosphate breakdown products generated extracellularly following degradation of nucleotides contained therein upon activation of ectonucleotidases present either presynaptically along axons contacting astrocytic endfeet ensheathing blood vessels near active zones or post synapticallyaround dendritic spines receiving inputs from presynaptic axon terminal boutons containing metabotropic P2Y receptor subtypes (Fredholm et al., 2 0 1 1b; Lalo et al., 2 0 1 1a; Pascual et al., 2 0 1 2b; Schipke et al., 2 0 1 3a). Extracellular purine nucleotide hydrolysis releases adenine nucleosides inosine monophosphate (IMP) and hypoxanthine whereas uridine diphosphate cleavage yields uracil nucleoside UDP resulting ultimately in production of AMP after dephosphorylation catalyzed mainly by ecto ‐ nucleotidasesA class enzymes localized both pre- andpostisynaptic sites respectively (Burnstock, 2 0 0 7b; Zimmermann et al., 2 0 1 6a). Adenosine formed intracellularly then acts extrasynaptosomally intoactivate G proteins coupled A1 subtype purinoceptors thereby modulating ion channel activities leading to changes ofaction potentialfrequency modulation affecting various aspects of CNS function includinglearning behaviors associated withfear conditioning paradigms (Cunha et al., 2 0 0 4a; Dale et al., 2 0 0 5a; Hoffman et al., 2 0 0 5b; Seibt et al., 2 0 0 8a; Xu et al., 2 0 1 0a; Yoon et al., 2 0 1 2a; Zhu et al., 2 0 1 3b). Although much progress had recently been made toward identifying additional putative mediators capable of acting intercellularly among different classes of nerve fibers innervating each otherso called “tripartite ” neuro transmitters consisting of classical neurotransmittersplus cotransmitting small molecular weight substances synthesized de novo onlybydistinct subsets of neuronsin vivo (Araque et al., 2 0 1 4b; Fields & Stevens ‐ Graham, 2 0 1 3c; Lee et al., 2 0 1 6b; Liu et al., 2 0 1 6c; Zhang et al., 2 0 1 6d), our knowledge regarding specific roles played by individual components remains limited due largely to lack of appropriate tools allowing selective manipulation without compromising overall physiological functions necessary for survival. Thus far only two genes encoding key players responsible forsynthesis of known endogenous modulators were found out of more thanten candidates screened based solely on sequence homology searches against existing databases although some novel ones await further characterization (Hölscher et al., 2 0 1 0b; Rathbone et al., 2 0 1 0; Tian et al., 2 0 1 0; Li et al., 2 0 1 2c; Wang et al., 2 0 1 2d; Chen et al., 2 0 1 3d; Huang et al., 2 0 1 3e; Oka et al., 2 0 1 4c; Yang et al., 2 0 1 5c; Zhou et al., 2 0 1
