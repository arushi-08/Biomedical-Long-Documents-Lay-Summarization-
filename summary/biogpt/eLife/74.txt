 with energetic constraints from growth dynamics may be broadly applicable across microbial systems where morphodynamics play an important role during development or adaptation processes such as colony spreading, swarming motility, fruiting body differentiation etc.. ▃ Broader Context ▃ Bacterial colonies exhibit diverse morphological patterns ranging from smooth surfaces (e.g. single cells) through rugose structures like slime cords up to highly structured mats composed by thousands of bacteria 1 - 3. These different forms have been observed under various environmental conditions 4 but their underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterized despite decades worth studying 5. Understanding morphogenetic programs will help us understand fundamental aspects about life at large 6; however, there has yet no general framework describing what drives complex cellular behaviors 7. In particular, little attention was paid so far towards understanding whether physical forces drive cell shape changes 8 since most studies focused only upon chemical interactions 9 while neglecting mechanics. This study provides evidence showing that both biochemical reactions and biophysical properties can act together within living organisms leading them into specific developmental pathways resulting ultimately in distinct phenotypes. Our results suggest that mechanochemistry could represent one major mechanism controlling biological form determination process beyond biochemistry alone. ▃ Results & Discussion ▃ Mechanical instability underlies V. cholera's transition from planktonic state to sessile mode: when grown planktonically, individual motile rod shaped bacterium do not produce any detectable stress fibers nor other types of extracellular polymeric substances whereas they grow well organized three dimensional multicellular aggregates termed "pellicles' after 2 0 hours incubation time. To investigate if mechanically unstable states contribute significantly to the emergence of 3D structure inside developing P. aeruginosa PA1 4ΔwspF mutant strain biofilms, we performed experiments measuring local stresses generated around isolated microfabricated probes placed near young wild type PAO1 strains embedded in agar medium. Local deformations were measured via optical microscopy coupled with digital particle tracking velocimetry technique allowing quantification of shear rates along probe paths. As expected based on previous work 1 0, Young modulus values estimated here ranged over two orders magnitude depending on location i.e. close proximity either side of the tip / wall interface. Interestingly enough, all tested samples exhibited significant negative normal compressive stiffness indicating presence of tensile deformation modes even though typical tension dominated behavior would predict positive elastic moduli due to strong adhesion effects. Furthermore, high spatial resolution imaging revealed several features consistent with locally developed buckling suggesting that curvature driven flow fields might induce localized bending moments thereby promoting self assembly phenomena similar to those reported previously for lipid vesicles exposed to external pressure gradients 1 1. Based on theoretical considerations presented below, we propose that inhomogeneous distribution of material parameters combined with fluid flows induced by capillary action lead to spatially heterogeneous distributions of effective membrane tensions thus generating regions prone to develop spontaneous curvatures. Such curved geometries then serve as nucleation sites initiating further evolution toward more stable configurations resembling mature mushroom architecture found in older cultures. Using numerical simulations involving continuum elasticity models and finite element analysis tools, we investigated quantitatively the effect of varying initial geometry and boundary condition assumptions regarding substrate rigidity and applied load levels respectively onto final equilibrium configuration obtained experimentally. Simulations showed good agreement with experimental observations confirming robustness of proposed hypothesis concerning origin of macroscopic pattern formations. Moreover, calculations indicated existence of critical threshold value above which stability becomes compromised hence triggering destabilization events responsible for initiation of branching points giving rise eventually to branched architectures characteristic of late stage maturing WT biofilms. It should noted that although many details related to molecular composition still need clarification, recent reports indicate that exopolysaccharides produced mainly by Psl polysaccharide layer constitute primary drivers behind early stages of biofilm maturation namely attachment phase followed later by accumulation of cellulose matrix layers mediated primarily by Pel polysaccharides 1 2. Therefore, given sufficient concentration gradient of EPS molecules present throughout entire thickness of nascent biofilm, initially formed spherical protrusions become elongated before reaching steady size until finally forming mushroomed appearance reminiscent of matured multi layered biofilms seen in old culture plates. Since polymer chains constituting each component of ECM polymers possess very low intrinsic viscosity compared to water, hydrodynamic drag associated with bulk liquid motion plays crucial roles determining its transport rate. For instance, diffusion coefficient D ~ 1x1 0-6 cm2 s -1 calculated for alginate molecule indicates relatively fast diffusive regime relative to pure solvent 1 3 making possible rapid build ups of concentrations necessary for subsequent polymerization reaction steps involved in synthesis of biopolymers comprising the outer shell surrounding micro scale objects. On another hand, considering viscoelastic nature of biopolymer networks, gel network characteristics dictate viscoelasticity response of materials subject to externally imposed loads. Hence, rheological characterization reveals non linear behaviour especially hysteresis loops corresponding to relaxation times τ = τmax − t * α + b reflecting dynamic heterogeneity arising out of internal microstructure heterogeneities. Indeed, rheology data shows pronounced differences among mutants lacking genes encoding proteins implicated in biosynthesis pathway of respective macromolecules implying differential contribution made by certain macromolecular species contributing to emergent physico-chemo-dynamical behaviours governing phenotypic transitions. Specifically, absence of WzzP protein leads to loss of viscous character manifested by increased storage capacity G ′ without affecting yield point G. However, lack of BslA causes increase in maximum displacement δ accompanied decrease in recovery angle β signifying higher degree of solid content than controls. Absence of SadB led to reduction in plateau
