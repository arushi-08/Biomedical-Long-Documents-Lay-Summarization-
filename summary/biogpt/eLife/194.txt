 targeting can be used for efficient vaccination strategies against cancer or infectious diseases without requiring adjuvants such as LPS which may cause severe side effects due their pro-inflammatory properties. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction: ▃ Dendritic Cells (DCs) play an essential role during immune responses because they take up pathogens from peripheral tissues via pattern recognition molecules like Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) and present them together with co-stimulatory signals derived form pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) at MHC class I complexes leading to activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes In addition to PRRs recognizing microbial components, DC express several carbohydrate binding proteins including lectins Here we report about engineering glycosylated ovalbumin (OVA; gOVAL) using synthetic glycans containing Lewis x epitopes mimicking natural ligands recognized specifically by MGL1. gOVALs were efficiently taken up into human monocyte-differentiated macrophages through mannose receptor- but not CLEC9A-pathways resulting in lysosomal localization similar to endogenous glycoproteins. Intracellular trafficking studies revealed accumulation of gOVALS within late endosomes marked by Rab7 while no colocalization could been detected between lysosomes labeled by LAMP2 staining and internalized glyco-conjugates indicating fast degradation kinetics. Importantly, compared to unmodified protein only low amounts of gOVAL1 5 2 4 needed to reach comparable levels of activated OT II splenocytes suggesting superior immunogenicity even though both forms had identical amino acid sequences except one single glycosylation site being modified. This effect depended strongly upon expression level of MGL since it did not occur when comparing wild types versus Mgl − / y BMDC. gOVA1 8 3 6 showed less pronounced differences than gOVA2 7 9. A detailed analysis demonstrated improved induction of IFN γ producing CD4 + helper T cells. iLN injection experiments confirmed strong adjuvant activity of gOVAs especially towards CTLs despite lack of TLR4 stimulation potential. Finally, our data suggest involvement of Galectin-Glycome interactions rather then direct interaction of Galectins themselves based on inhibition assays performed under non reducing conditions where galectin ligand specificity should remain intact. Taken together, targeted delivery approaches exploiting sugar moieties might represent promising alternatives over classical vaccine formulations relying solely on peptide epitope loading onto major histocompatibility complex classes I. These results have important implications regarding future design concepts aiming toward more effective vaccines avoiding toxic immunostimulation caused e.g. by bacterial contaminations. < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ < METHOD > < FREETEXT > Materials & Methods: ▃ Cell culture reagents RPMI Medium GlutaMAX TM -I supplemented with HEPES buffer solution pH = 7. 4, sodium pyruvate MEM medium 1x Non Essential Amino Acids Solution 2x Penicillin Streptomycin Sulfate Sodium Salt Solution 5x Trypsin EDTA 1X Fetal Bovine Serum FBS fetal bovine serum GM-CSF granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor IL interleukin PBS phosphate buffered saline PFA paraformaldehyde FITC fluorescein isothiocyanate PE phycoerythrin APC allophycocyanin MFI mean fluorescence intensity HRP horseradish peroxidase ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis TBS Tris Buffered Saline TMB tetramethylbenzidine FACS Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting FCS foetal calf serumsDMEM Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media HBSS Hank ´ s Balanced Salts Solution MES 2- [N-morpholino] ethanesulfonic Acid EGTA ethylene glycol tetraacetic acidRIPA Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay Buffer PMSF phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride PVDF polyvinylidene difluoride BSA bovineserum albumin ECL electrochemiluminescence OD optical density ANOVA Analysis Of Variance H h half maximal inhibitory concentration IC Inhibitory Concentration IP intraperitoneal i.n. intranasal s.c. subcutaneous i.p. intraperitoneally Ag antigenc antigenic peptideg glycoconjugate gp glycoprotein Th Helper CTL Cytotoxic Lymphocyte KLH keyhole limpet hemocyanin APCs APCmin Carboxyamidotriazole maleimide NHS N- Hydroxysuccinimide TFA trifluoroacetic anhydride ACN acetonitrile LC liquid chromatography MS mass spectrometry UV ultraviolet light HPLC High Performance Liquid Chromatography SEC size exclusion chromatographym nESI nanospray ionization TOF time oflightNMR nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy CD circular dichroism DSC differential scanning calorimetry TEM transmission electron microscopy DAMP damage Associated Molecular Patterns PAMP Pathogen Associated Molecular Pattern PRR Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein PS phosphatidylserine SPR surface plasmon resonancemAb antibody Ii Inositol MonoPhosphate PNGase F Peptide NGlycosidase F rb recombinant B mAb monoclonal Antibody mw millimass unit MW kilodalton kDa kiloDaltons pI isoelectric point RT room temperature SA streptavidin SD standard deviation SEM Standard Error Mean < / FREETEXT > < / EXP > ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃
