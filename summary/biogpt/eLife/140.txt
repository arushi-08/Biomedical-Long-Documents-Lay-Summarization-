 mechanism by which cells maintain their own high level of chemical fidelity during translation elongation. This work also suggests new avenues towards developing novel anti-malarial drugs targeting malaria parasites through selective inhibition or activation of parasite enzymes responsible for maintaining translational integrity against host homologues. ▃ Main text: ▃ Protein synthesis involves three major steps - initiation, termination & ribosomal translocation 1; 2. During each stage, correct selection / rejection of cognate vs. non-cognates at individual codon sites within mRNA template dictates whether polypeptide chains will be synthesized 3. For example, when translating codons starting with G + C nucleotides as' N's, ribosomes select A over G. However, if there exists any nucleotide mismatch between first two bases following such mismatches then they reject them 4. To ensure accurate decoding all four nucleobases must therefore remain intact 5 while single base substitutions can lead to misincorporation 6. Such errors have been shown experimentally 7 but still not fully understood 8 due partly because most studies focus solely upon structural aspects 9 rather than kinetic mechanisms involving both binding events and catalytic turnover. Furthermore, although several factors contribute significantly toward error rates including sequence composition around coding regions, secondary structures formed inside mRNAs etc …, only few reports describe detailed kinetics data using purified components under controlled conditions 1 0 – 1 2. Thus far none has studied enzymatic discrimination among enantiomers other than those containing naturally occurring L- forms like D- Phe, -Tyr, -D Trp etc. where significant differences were observed 1 3. These observations suggest existence either of highly evolved systems capable of discriminating amongst different types of enantiomeric substrates or lack thereof altogether. It was recently reported however that bacterial tyrosyl transfer RNA synthetase discriminately binds its natural enantiomer out of others based purely on steric constraints without relying exclusively on electrostatic interactions 1 4 suggesting possible evolutionary pressure acting differentially across species even though overall fold similarity remains conserved throughout evolution. Another recent report describes use of engineered variants of human glycyl t-RNAs resulting in enhanced selectivity for one particular stereoisomer compared to wild type counterparts despite being structurally identical outside chirality centres 1 5 indicating potential importance of subtle changes away form active site architecture leading up to functional divergence. Here we show biochemical evidence showing robust enantioselectivity exhibited by PfDTDs isolated independently via affinity purification methods followed by crystallization screening efforts. We further demonstrate distinct molecular features underlying enantioselective interaction allowing us to propose plausible models explaining why certain proteins may exhibit stereospecificity whilst retaining near absolute stereochemical identity elsewhere else would fail to do so effectively! Our results indicate absence of direct involvement of key catalytically important groups thereby providing strong support for our hypothesis regarding indirect role played by local environment surrounding critical atoms forming part of ligand interface contributing substantially towards stereoselectivity. Finally, given widespread occurrence of D-isomers especially in pathogenic organisms, understanding stereo-chemistry could help design more potent inhibitors specifically targeted against pathogens causing diseases ranging from1 6to1 8.Therefore, elucidation of precise details about stereoselective nature behind various metabolic pathways should prove useful in designing better therapeutic agents having minimal adverse effects on normal hosts. ▃ Results ▃ Selectivity profiling reveals broad spectrum activity displayed byPfDTD1 7.The presence ofsix consecutive prolines along α helix hinge2 appears crucial forefficient accommodation of bulky hydrophobic moieties attached onto Cα atom since deletion mutants lacking proline repeats failed to bind ligands efficiently.. Interestingly removal of just five additional alanines resulted incomplete loss of function whereas addition back restored full functionality between.1 3and.2 0μM concentrations tested here implying some degree of flexibility required beyond simple rigid helical elements. Deletion mutant Δ1 4Δ2 1showed reduced efficiency signifying requirement of proper length apart from rigidity too. Further shortening down to nine alanine repeat did result in almost total abrogation of functionality.This observation indicates possibility of formation of longer helices possibly facilitating tighter packing of subunits enabling higher levels of stability needed for functioning. Although similar trend emerged irrespective of concentration used, interestingly maximum effect seen after deleting seven Ala units seems much lower than.7 5μM concentrations.Since above mentioned deletions affect entire region encompassing α2 helix hence might influence conformation drastically affecting dimer assembly making interpretation difficult. Hence attempts made herein focused primarily onidentifying point mutations imparting differential impact depending on location relative to putative hinge area. Based on previous literature describing roles attributed to respective mutated residue positions, mutation T1 2A appeared least likely to alter global folding pattern owing to conservation of position close to surface area.3 Mutations I1 3A, N1 5A, L1 7A had drastic consequences probably altering inter domain orientation effecting dimerization efficiently.4 Mutation G1 8A seemed less disruptive perhaps disrupting hydrogen bonding network stabilizing loop connecting α1 helices.5 Point mutation S1 9A affected mainly ATP hydrolysis rate presumably influencing allosteric communication pathway relaying information received from aminoacylation site.6 Mutant G2 0A disrupted coupling between ATPase domains preventing conformational change necessary for productive positioning of acceptor arm for nucleophilic attack. Mutants Y2 1A and F2 4A seem equally detrimental abrogating aromatic stacking interactions potentially destabilizing quaternary arrangement of dimers7Overall mutational analysis revealed interesting trends highlighting significance of discrete areas located nearby central core mediating distinctive functions associated withDTD.8 Of note, except Y1 6A substitution completely abrogated function, remaining ones retained partial activity.9 All functionally
