 force transduction during neuronal pathfinding at high spatiotemporal resolution (Fig. P1). This work provides mechanistic insights on how neurons integrate multiple signals from extracellular environment through cytoskeletal dynamics toward directional motility via mechanotransduction machinery such as those described here. Furthermore, our results suggest potential therapeutic targets against neurodevelopmental disorders caused by mutations affecting cytoskeleton regulators or its effectors including SHOT1 / 2 proteins. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Axon Guidance Molecules, Cell Biology, Development Differentiation, Extracellular Matrix Proteins, Neurobiology, Signal Transduction, Actin Cytoskeleton, Myosin II Motor Protein, Mechanotransducer, Netrin Signaling Pathway, Shot1 Phosphorylation < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > The establishment of neural circuits requires precise control over neurite outgrowth guided primarily along specific pathways known collectively as “molecular highways ” formed between cells expressing different types of receptors recognizing distinct ligands expressed either uniformly across an entire field or locally confined around individual neurites growing out onto their path. In addition to chemical factors acting alone, recent studies have shown important roles played also by mechanical stimuli exerted upon migrating cells when exposed simultaneously to both soluble molecules secreted extracellularly and physical constraints imposed externally. These include substrate stiffness itself but more importantly anisotropic distribution thereof arising due to differential expression patterns among various components constituting cellular microenvironment surrounding each neuron being studied. Although many aspects remain poorly understood regarding mechanisms underlying integration of biochemical information encoded therein together with external biophysical inputs sensed directly or indirectly inside motile structures like lamellipodia driven mainly by polymerization of filamentous actins (FFs) 3 rather than microtubules nucleated predominantly near microtubule organizing centers located behind them, there has been increasing evidence suggesting critical involvement of mechanosensitive ion channels localized specifically beneath leading edges where membrane tension changes rapidly depending not only on magnitude but even sign of applied stress. Such channel activation leads subsequently to modulation of intracellular Ca + concentration thereby regulating downstream events involved critically in regulation of dynamic behaviors associated with protrusion formation followed later by retraction occurring concomitantly throughout all regions of moving protrusions under influence of actomyosin contractile apparatus powered largely though myosin light chain kinase activity activated independently albeit indiscriminately by Rho GTPases Cdc4 2p and Rac1 activating RhoA inhibiting contractility while promoting assembly respectively. It remains unknown whether any other mechanism besides direct sensing may be used concurrently so long as sufficient levels of active myosins exist allowing effective contraction generated intracellularly despite limited availability of ATP needed otherwise if one assumes energy conservation strategy adopted often employed by organisms living mostly aerobically. Indeed, although much attention was paid recently especially because some genetic diseases were found linked closely related to defects involving cytoskeletons themselves particularly motor protein families driving movement based solely on hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate coupled energetically well conserved process essential for life processes ranging widely from bacteria to humans, very little progress had yet made until now concerning identification of possible candidates mediating signal transmission linking upstream mechanotransductions initiated elsewhere still residing outside cytoplasm precisely underneath plasma membranes embedded most likely lipid bilayers harboring numerous transmembrane receptor complexes responsible for detection of diverse environmental clues thus far identified except integrins whose role seems best established experimentally nevertheless playing key functions intimately connected functionally essentially exclusively with integrin family members interacting physically with ECM constituents comprising major structural elements providing support necessary for maintaining tissue integrity whereas others serving merely adhesive function presumably engaged additionally mechanically too given relatively large size enabling close proximity to neighboring matrix fibers making contact readily available regardless nature of ligand binding sites present intrinsically capable of undergoing conformational change triggered allosterically after engagement independent of presence versus absence of bound ligand. Thus identifying additional candidate mediators functioning possibly bridging gap existing presently between cytoplasmic domains anchored proximally facing inner leaflet of bilayer containing integral parts of respective surface complex bearing corresponding cognate partners responding appropriately accordingly would certainly help us better understand fundamental principles governing development of nervous system circuitry orchestrated spatiomechanical interactions operating coordinately alongside classical chemotropic responses evoked by diffusible chemicals emanating form distant sources distributed broadly spanning tissues encompassing whole body hence termed morphogen gradient hypothesis proposed originally decades ago before discovery of actual existence of true chemoattractant secreting source producing chemotactic factor named Wnt which turned up actually produced ubiquitously instead initially thought restricted just below apical surfaces enclosing developing brain primordium giving rise thereafter to neocortex proper consisting almost entirely of cortical plate composed chiefly of radially oriented pyramidal layer 6 excitatory principal neurons projecting dendrites extending vertically down towards pial surface. β-Catenin accumulating transiently accumulated apically adjacent to adherens junctions forming basal lamina contacting lateral ventricular zone epithelium representing presumptive outer subventricular zones lying immediately above future neocortical layers 5 plus subplates sandwiched laterally bordering marginal areas separating upper intermediate cortex destined eventually becoming white matter populated principally by inhibitory interneurons tangentially invading deep preplate region occupied finally superficial Cajal Retzius type GABAergic interneuron precursors leaving subcortical area devoid altogether radial glial scaffold traversed obliquely upward past emerging lower part of newly emerged primordial cerebral wall called indusium griseum running parallel horizontally away from pia mater then entering rostral portion of corpus callosum passing ventrally again reaching ventral aspect of hippocampus ultimately terminating dorsally next to anterior commissure joining hippocampal fimbrial fornix pathway crossing caudolaterally once further continuing dorsolateraly ending abruptly beyond dorsal midline resulting
