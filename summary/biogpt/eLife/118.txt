 in cancer cells compared to normal tissue controls; however, they do not exhibit increased sensitivity towards PARP inhibition or platinum chemotherapy treatment suggesting their utility only within specific contexts such as BRCA1 / 2 inactivation. Finally, our analysis reveals several genes whose expression levels correlate significantly with patient survival times including PTPRD which has been previously implicated in ovarian tumorigenesis. Overall, our study provides new insights into mutational processes underlying somatic evolution during carcinogenesis while also identifying potential biomarkers useful both diagnostically and therapeutically.

Base excision repairs remove small lesions like oxidized purines caused primarily by reactive oxygen species whereas bulky adducts induced mainly after UV irradiation require Nucleotide Excision Repair machinery removes larger chemical modifications found predominantly around pyrimidine dimers formed between adjacent pyrimidines when exposed to ultraviolet light. Both base excisions involve damage recognition followed by removal of modified nucleotides before being replaced
