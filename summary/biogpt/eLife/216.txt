 platform will facilitate future studies on early developmental events underlying cardio / pulmonar organogenesis as well as modeling disease pathogenesis using patient iPSCs carrying genetic mutations affecting either or all three germ layers including those involved in congenital malformations such as Down syndrome [1 – 3]. Furthermore, it may also be useful when generating tissue engineered organs by co-culturing multiple cell types under defined conditions without relying upon exogenously added morphogens. In addition, since hiPSC technology has been successfully applied toward regenerative medicine applications through generation of functional cardiomyocytes capable of engrafting into injured hearts after myocardial infarction; thus far no study have used hPSCs combined together with hPSC derivatives representing different organ systems simultaneously towards multi-cellular tissues resembling native counterparts at various stages along development. Our approach provides an innovative tool not only enabling us to generate complex yet functionally competent multicellular structures mimicking natural physiological processes but can potentially serve as powerful tools facilitating drug screening platforms targeting diseases involving defects across several distinct body compartments. It should therefore prove valuable especially if one considers personalized approaches where patients ’ own somatic genomes could be reprogrammed back to pluripotency followed by directed differentiations yielding customized “off ” -state iPSC lines tailored specifically against individual needs based on genomic information obtained prior treatment onset. This would allow researchers to develop individualized therapies utilizing differentiated products generated ex vivo rather than simply delivering drugs directly to diseased sites thereby avoiding potential side effects associated with systemic delivery methods currently being utilized clinically today. Thus, while further optimization still need to occur before clinical translation becomes feasible, here we present proof-of- concept data demonstrating feasibility of creating physiologically active modular microtissues containing two major developmentally regulated mesodermal sub-populations: cardiogenic precursors expressing Nkx2. 5 + transcription factor required for normal cardiovascular function and endodermal progenitors which give rise to distal airway epithelium lining alveoli lined airspaces surrounded by surfactant secreting type I pneumocytes found throughout mammalian lungs. Such modularly assembled tri-partite organoids consisting of self organizing embryonic progenitor niches recapitulating key aspects of fetal physiology represent promising new model system allowing investigation of fundamental mechanisms governing inter-compartmental interactions essential for successful cardiopulmonary septation necessary for postnatal life support following birth. Moreover, they offer great promise for studying molecular pathways regulating specification of multipotent mesenchymal stromal precursor pools responsible for maintaining homeostasis among diverse connective tissue- forming mesenchyme subtypes residing outside vasculature beds like skeletal muscle fibers surrounding bone marrow sinusoids, tendon sheaths around joints etc.. Finally, given recent advances made recently regarding derivation of mature hepatocyte cultures exhibiting hepatic functions comparable to primary hepatocytes isolated post mortem from adult livers, similar efforts aimed at deriving fully matured respiratory epithelia might eventually lead to production of transplantable bioartificial liver devices providing temporary metabolic assistance until endogenous regeneration occurs naturally once injury resolves. Taken altogether, combining advanced technologies developed over decades ago to derive specialized parenchymal elements representative of respective target organs- e.g. intestinal villi composed primarily of absorptive enterocytes vs. bronchial tubes comprised predominantly of secretory Clara cells--coupled with emerging protocols designed to direct efficient trans-differentiating PSCs down desired fates offers exciting opportunities for engineering highly sophisticated living miniature bio hybrid constructs whose structural organization closely mimics what exists normally inside intact organisms. These mini bodies hold tremendous therapeutic value particularly because many disorders arise due to malfunctioning interplay amongst disparate anatomical units comprising vital biological entities ranging from simple circulatory networks supporting oxygen transport up to intricate vascular communications linking distant parts of internal anatomy. For example, some forms of cancer result from abnormal communication patterns resulting in aberrant blood flow distribution leading to hypoxia even though tumors themselves do contain viable oxygenated regions indicating failure of local regulatory control mechanisms.By contrast, certain rare inherited syndromes characterized by severe malformation phenotypes often involve defective connections between adjacent anatomic segments making them difficult targets amenable solely to surgical repair strategies. Therefore, creation of miniaturized synthetic analogs possessing properties akin to actual animal subjects represents significant technological advancement offering unprecedented opportunity for testing efficacy of newly discovered therapeutics targeted exclusively to affected areas whilst sparing healthy ones. As mentioned above, current treatments available for most common pediatric cancers include chemotherapy regimens administered systemically causing serious adverse reactions mainly confined to non-cancerous host tissues rendering conventional therapy ineffective unless delivered locally near tumor locations. To address limitations inherent to traditional localized administration techniques, investigators have begun exploring alternative routes of administering chemotherapeutic agents more efficiently reaching malignant lesions located deep seated behind barriers separating otherwise protected environments such as brain parenchyma away from susceptible neural crest derivative malignancies originating therein.While implantable pumps remain widely employed experimental means whereby small molecules diffuse passively out of implanted reservoirs placed subcutaneously beneath skin folds overlying cranial vault bones, however, pump implantation procedures require invasive surgery performed late postnatally precluding timely intervention needed to prevent progression of malignancy despite initial diagnosis. Alternatively, biodegradable polymer scaffolds seeded with genetically modified fibroblasts producing cytotoxic proteins were shown effective in preventing metastasis formation whereas others demonstrated effectiveness of encapsulated oncolytic viruses releasing interferon gamma protein inhibiting proliferation of glioma initiating cultures.This work demonstrates utility of polymeric scaffold implants loaded with adenoviral vectors encoding IFN γ gene inserted downstream of cytomegalovirus promoter driving expression selectively in CMV positive fibroblast population embedded within degradable poly lactic acid matrix injected subdermally onto mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts formed by murine melanoma B1 6 F1 0 cells stably transfected with luciferase reporter genes driven constitutively byCytomegalovirus promoter.The authors showed
