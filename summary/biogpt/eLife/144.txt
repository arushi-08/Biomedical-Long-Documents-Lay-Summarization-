 devices were designed based on simple mechanical principles such as spring or piston action; however, we suggest an alternative design principle: "smart valves" which allow users control when they switch between different functions during use (e.g., feeding vs. reproduction) using soft materials actuators rather than hard parts. Smart valves could be useful tools both from evolutionary biology studies about animal behavior mechanisms toward artificial intelligence applications where humans must interact directly with machines without any prior knowledge regarding animals' behaviors. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
