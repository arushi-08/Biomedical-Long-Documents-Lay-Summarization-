 roles played by both spontaneous fluctuations as well as voluntary modulation on neuronal populations' responses at multiple scales (local field potentials [LFPs]; spiking) with respect to subsequent movements. These results suggest that ongoing brain states can influence future behaviors through alterations in LFP dynamics across different spatial resolutions within individual neurons. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Beta band oscillation has long held promise as biomarker reflecting cognitive processes such attention allocation, learning / memory retrieval etc.. However its functional role remains unclear due largely to lack of direct evidence linking it directly to any particular aspect of cognition beyond simple detection based upon visual inspection alone. Here using macaque monkeys performing a new paradigm where subjects could voluntarily modulate their own beta rhythms over extended periods prior to action execution revealed several important aspects about what is happening: 1) The amplitude change between two distinct levels of baseline beta rhythm predicts upcoming actions 2) Population spike rate shifts away from one level toward another 3) Movement initiation time decreases when there exists greater difference among spikes generated before vs. after peak frequency 4) Spike timing variability increases under conditions associated with higher mean firing rates 5) There exist significant differences not only in magnitude but also temporal structure of ensemble activities depending whether they occur early versus late relative to target presentation 6) A larger proportion of cells exhibit more consistent phase relationships following high compared low gamma bursts 7) In addition to providing insight into potential mechanisms behind human clinical disorders involving abnormal resting EEG patterns 8 9% of all single units show similar response profiles suggesting common network interactions involved regardless if those represent normal physiology or pathology. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
