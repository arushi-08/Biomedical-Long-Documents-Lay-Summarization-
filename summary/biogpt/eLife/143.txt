 could also affect spike timing estimates by altering neuronal responses during spontaneous activity; however, our results suggest that genetic labeling is unlikely to have an effect on spiking patterns within single trials unless it alters baseline firing rates substantially beyond what would occur naturally due to differences among animals. Our data indicate that even if genetically labeled cells do not fire spontaneously at high enough frequencies as observed here [which may never happen], they will still contribute significantly toward overall network output through their effects upon background noise levels rather than via changes in mean response properties such as latency times relative to other nearby unlabeled units. These observations highlight important considerations regarding experimental design: while many factors influence signal strength, including dye loading time point after injection into brain tissue, optical fiber placement over recording sites, depth below surface plane etc … there appears little evidence suggesting any significant difference across dyes nor expression level dependent variation in sensitivity to detect spikes above chance rate. The ability to reliably identify individual unit signals depends primarily on several parameters related directly to physiology - e.g. number of recorded fluorescent pixels, spatial resolution achieved using different wavelengths, temporal sampling frequency... In addition, some aspects of behavior like head position must vary considerably throughout experiments so care should always be taken to ensure consistent stimulus presentation protocols. Finally, although all methods discussed herein rely heavily on electrophysiological measurements made simultaneously with Ca + -indicator injections, one advantage offered by combining electrophysiology techniques with two photon microscopy comes simply out form its capability to perform functional connectivity mapping based solely on anatomical information obtained non invasively without requiring invasive surgical procedures. This approach has been successfully applied previously to map structural connections underlying sensory processing networks in awake behaving rodents 4 6, 5 7, providing valuable insights about circuit organization critical for understanding mechanisms governing perception and cognition. However, because both anatomy and physiological measures depend critically on animal preparation, careful attention needs to paid before drawing conclusions concerning structure vs. function relationships derived purely from either technique alone. For example, recent work suggests caution might need to be exercised interpreting reports where apparent correlations exist between morphology and intrinsic excitability measured electrophysiologically despite no obvious correlation found anatomically 9, perhaps reflecting limitations inherent to each method itself. We hope future efforts aimed towards developing improved tools capable of linking cellular features identified optically to those seen electrically provides new opportunities to understand cortical circuits operating far deeper inside living brains compared to previous approaches relying exclusively on electrical stimulation combined with histology. Such advances promise exciting progress moving forward since current technologies allow us now access unprecedented detail relating fundamental biophysical processes occurring deep beneath intact mammalian tissues enabling direct observation of dynamic interactions amongst multiple types of active elements embedded deeply buried underneath layers II & III of neocortex. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All mouse strains described received approval prior experimentation according to guidelines established by Institutional Animal Care Committees at Stanford University School of Medicine and Washington State University. mThy1-YFP line M was purchased originally from Jackson Laboratories stock  MMRRC Stock Number = JAX: Tg (Thy1-YFPH * M1 8Gsat / Mmnc) 6Pjn / J. Mice homozygous for hChR2 H1 3R transgene driven off tetracycline responsive promoter element tetO sequence inserted downstream of CaMKIIα gene locus were generated following standard breeding strategy detailed elsewhere 5 8. Briefly, heterozygous male founders carrying tTA allele crossed back onto C5 7BL / 6J strain females produced offspring hemizygous for CaMKII ∷ rtTA alleles along with homozygotes for TRE ∷ HCHR transgenes resulting in double heterozygotes referred hereafter as “CamKIIαHC ” genotype. Double heterozygote males bred against wild type female resulted in litters containing pups born bearing various combinations of genotypes ranging from wildtype littermates lacking TetON cassette to triple homozygote progeny harboring three copies of Tet operator sequences upstream of Cre recombinase coding region driving constitutive overexpression of channelrhodopsin variant known as Channelrhodopsin2 fused to yellow florescent protein called YPF.
