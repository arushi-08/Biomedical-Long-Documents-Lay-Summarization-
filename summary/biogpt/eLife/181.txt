 can act at multiple levels in controlling cell fate decisions during development: it blocks exit from self renewal while promoting commitment toward specific lineages through two distinct molecular pathways acting sequentially rather than simultaneously as might be expected if they were operating separately downstream of each other or simply converging onto common targets such as transcription factors known to regulate lineage specification. These results highlight novel roles played by extracellular signals early in embryonic stem cell culture conditions before exogenous patterning molecules become available; our work provides new insights into regulatory networks governing mammalian developmental processes with implications beyond embryogenesis itself.
