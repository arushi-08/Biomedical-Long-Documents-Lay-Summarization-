 odors that occur at random times during ongoing stimulation. Our results suggest that neural computations underlying animal behavior can be implemented through temporally selective coding mechanisms operating within specific neuronal populations rather than across all cells involved or distributed over multiple cell types. ▃ ▃ ▃ SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT ▃ Animals must constantly orient themselves toward sources of food, mates, predators etc … To do so they use information about their environment provided mainly via olfaction; however it remains unclear what role different features such as intensity / duration vs. frequency play for behavioral performance. Here I show using electrophysiological recordings from insect brains that some aspects of processing may involve only particular subsets of neuron while others rely on more global properties like overall firing rates which allow efficient representation of stimulus dynamics without losing sensitivity when detecting sudden changes. This suggests possible ways forward towards understanding computation principles behind complex biological systems: first focusing specifically upon individual components then considering them collectively instead of relying solely on whole system responses. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
