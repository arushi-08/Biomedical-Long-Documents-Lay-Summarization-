 forces generated during invagination can be harnessed as an active mechanism driving vesicle formation under conditions where spontaneous curvature alone cannot overcome high tensions on cell surfaces or within intracellular compartments such as endosomes. This article has implications beyond CME: it provides insights about other processes involving dynamic cytoskeletal networks driven through molecular interactions among multiple components. The authors also discuss future directions including modeling approaches based upon their results; experiments testing hypotheses derived from simulations using genetically engineered yeast strains expressing fluorescently labeled proteins involved in CCP maturation (e.g. dynamin); single particle tracking studies probing dynamics near CCPs undergoing scission events; quantitative analysis combining experimental data obtained via fluorescence microscopy techniques like TIRFM [time lapse total internal reflection fluorescent microscope] imaging along with computational methods used here to simulate growth kinetics over long timescales; biophysical measurements determining whether there exists any correlation between local mechanical properties measured around nascent vesicles formed inside living mammalian cells.These questions will help elucidate mechanisms underlying protein recruitment patterns observed when studying individual molecules interacting dynamically throughout different stages of receptor trafficking pathways leading up to budding off cargo containing organelles. They may even lead us closer than ever before towards understanding why some receptors traffic efficiently while others do not. In addition they could potentially explain differences seen across species regarding rates of recycling versus degradation depending on which pathway dominates uptake. Finally we hope our work stimulates further discussion amongst those working closely related to cytoskeleton function.
