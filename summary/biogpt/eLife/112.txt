 lens system more than it does; however we found no evidence supporting such an effect on macular optical quality or contrast sensitivity when comparing long versus short eyed individuals with similar refractive error correction levels. Our results suggest there may exist some compensatory mechanism which allows shorter people without presbyopia compensation develop good uncorrected distance acuities despite having lower photoreceptor densities per unit area across their retina due to myopia development over time. This study provides important baseline data about human foveae from normal populations before further studies can investigate whether changes occur after cataract surgery where both rod loss and central neural adaptation could potentially affect spatial resolution performance through altered viewing strategies rather than simply decreased numbers of surviving rods within each point spread function.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Myopic defocus causes progressive thinning of outer segments along all three dimensions of individual primate retinas leading ultimately to reduced number of functional receptors available for high level processing. However previous reports indicate significant inter subject variability even among young adults who appear healthy enough to participate regularly throughout life: many show little change while others lose most if they do so. Here using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy imaging techniques we find considerable variation amongst younger adult humans ranging widely in age yet still showing relatively consistent patterns suggesting underlying genetic factors play key roles determining susceptibility towards developing severe forms of pathological conditions associated with ocular disease including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy etc … These observations highlight fundamental differences existing beyond those normally expected based upon current understanding regarding mechanisms involved in regulating cell death pathways following exposure to damaging stimuli like light damage - perhaps related to inherent variations present already early in embryonic developmental history prior to birth itself -thus providing opportunities for future investigations into possible pre natal origins of certain diseases affecting older patients later in adulthood. In addition, given recent interest surrounding use of multifocal intraocular lenses designed specifically for accommodation enhancement particularly in cases involving low hyperopia & astigmatism, knowledge gained here will help inform design considerations relating to optimal placement of focal points relative to anatomical constraints imposed by different types ofIOLs implanted under various circumstances. Finally, since much attention has been paid recently toward improving reading speed via accommodative devices especially in children whose ability to accommodate declines rapidly past childhood years, knowing what happens to peripheral regions once distances become too far away should also prove useful information allowing us to understand why improved efficiency comes only slowly behind actual improvements seen behaviorally. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
