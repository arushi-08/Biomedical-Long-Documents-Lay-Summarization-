 protein 1 2 or CFTR ∆ F5 0 8 mutant but not their stability at steady state level when overexpressed alone. Our results suggest an unexpected role for posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation and acylation acting directly after synthesis rather than cotranslationally before insertion into membranes: they act like molecular timers ensuring efficient maturation only if correctly inserted within cellular compartments where required cofactors can be present. The discovery here opens new perspectives toward understanding diseases caused either due to misfolding mutations affecting transmembrane domains or defects in accessory factors involved in quality control mechanisms operating downstream of translation initiation events. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > INTRODUCTION ▃ Membrane biogenesis involves several steps including targeting nascent polypeptides emerging out of ribosomes through translocation pores embedded across lipid bilayers; recognition of hydrophobic segments exposed outside the ribosome tunnel via dedicated chaperone systems; lateral release driven mainly by translocon components Translocase Associated Proteins TRAP complex In addition to its function promoting N α -myristoylation, NMT1 has been shown recently to catalyze methylation Of note, all three types of PTMs have already emerged as important regulators of many biological processes ranging form cell growth regulation to immune response modulation Among them, phosphorylation plays key roles both inside cells regulating signal transduction pathways and controlling subcellular localization of substrates Finally, our data indicate that ERAD machinery does play some part in removing misfolded forms of LRP6 because overexpression of SEL1L increases levels of ubiquitinated species whereas knockdown reduces those (Figure S1 3). However, since inhibition of proteasomal activity leads to accumulation of unmodified full length LRP6 without increasing amounts of modified bands suggesting no major contribution of proteasome mediated proteolysis under normal conditions, additional players must exist beside ERAD pathway contributing to clearance of aberrant receptors. One possibility could involve autophagy which was previously reported to degrade nonglycosylated variants of rhodopsin Another interesting aspect concerns whether any particular PTM might serve exclusively regulatory functions or may instead represent signals triggering different fates depending upon location along biosynthetic routes. For example, although most studies so far focused mostly on extracellular domain modification, recent reports showed intracellular trafficking being regulated differently according to site of attachment As mentioned above, there exists evidence indicating that even highly conserved residues located near TM regions do exhibit distinct functional properties On one hand, considering the high conservation among sequences belonging to homologous families, it seems likely that each residue should fulfill certain structural requirements independently of position relative to TMs. Indeed, previous work suggested that amino acids facing lipids tend to adopt helical conformations more frequently compared to hydrophilic ones Interestingly, despite having similar hydrophobicity profiles, Lys 6 4 7 appears less prone to get acetylated than Arg 5 9 1 thus raising questions about possible differences between two basic AAs regarding propensity to interact with acyl transferases responsible for Nt acetylation Therefore, further investigations will need to address what determines specificity towards various acylating machineries and why some sites appear preferentially used over others. Moreover, given the fact that single point mutation leading to loss of lipidation affects receptor's ability to activate canonical WNT signalling cascade It would therefore seem worthwhile investigating potential crosstalk existing between multiple post translational modifiers known to occur simultaneously on target substrate Such interplay includes cross talk observed between O-GlcNAcylation and tyrosine sulfation A final consideration regards the relevance of newly discovered mechanism described herein concerning defective assembly resulting in premature polyubiquitination followed by rapid disposal of incompletely assembled precursors unable to reach native conformation. Although still speculative, based on current knowledge, it remains plausible that failure to properly assemble precursor subunits prior to integration into plasma membrane causes aggregation preventing proper interaction with Frizzled co-receptors. β-catenin stabilization assay using Wnt3a conditioned medium revealed reduced activation efficiency following expression of K6 4R variant consistent with impaired processing seen earlier (Figures S9 – S2 1A available online). Furthermore, analysis performed on HEK2 9 3T stable clones expressing wild type versus mutated versions of LRP6 confirmed lower capacity of mutants lacking positive charges around TM6 region to induce TCF reporter gene transcription confirming inefficient formation of active signalosome (Figures S3 0A & B). These observations were extended beyond just LRP5 / 6R6 4K construct showing impairment of endogenous LRP6 turnover induced by tunicamycin treatment supporting existence of general principles governing early stages of biosynthesis underlying correct functioning of numerous GPCRs family members (Figures S4 5A & C). Taken together, our study reveals yet another layer of complexity involving cooperation between diverse posttranslationnal modificatons playing crucial roles throughout entire life span determining fate decisions made by individual polypeptide chains once released from ribosomal complexes. Further investigation aimed at elucidating precise timing of occurrence of every step taking place immediately upstream of TMD anchoring event shall shed light onto exact sequence determinants allowing discrimination between productive vs. non-productive interactions driving subsequent conformational transitions ultimately dictating ultimate outcome. Given importance attributed to TMDs especially in human disease related cases, identification of critical features defining successful association process represents essential first stage preceding development of therapeutic strategies aiming at correcting misguided behavior associated with pathogenic missense substitutions. < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ < METHOD > < FREETEXT > MATERIALS AND METHODS ▃ Cell culture reagents DMEM High Glucose Medium supplemented with L Glutamine, Penicillin Streptomycin solution 1X, Fetal Bovine Serum FBS Superior Premium Free Preparation purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc..
