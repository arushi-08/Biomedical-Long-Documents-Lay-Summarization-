The data suggest new approaches towards understanding inflammasome activation under physiological conditions where there may not yet have been sufficient time available through genetic manipulation experiments alone before we could begin investigating its role physiologically. In particular it suggests possible therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring normal cellular bioenergetics might help control inflammation associated diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 1 - 3. However further work will need to address whether similar mechanisms operate on other types of stress signals 4 5 0 6 7 8 9 2 9 9; ${\ rm n} ^ {H} = &  xtilde% 3ABX ~ B [\ bf text]\ hbox {O}:\ "BFIATER * OR AND OTHER OF THE COMPLEX ON BOTH PATHS IN INFLAMMATORY CELLS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THEIR ROLE AS THERAPEUTIC TARGETS FOR DISEASE PREVENTION ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > INTRODUCTION ▃ Inflammasomes play key roles both within healthy tissues To date most studies into their regulation were performed using immortalized macrophage lines stimulated either exogenously via TLR ligands or endogenously upon exposure to microbial stimuli Here we report our investigation of two different forms of stimulation known respectively to activate NLRC4 Based on previous reports suggesting NAD + depletion plays some part in regulating caspase activity Our initial hypothesis was therefore based around changes occurring following LPS priming but prior to any exogenous stimulus being applied. Indeed when measuring extracellular acidification rates over several hours after treatment with ATP, nigericin or MSU crystals no significant differences between untreated controls and those treated immediately post isolation were observed until approximately one hour later (Fig. As expected given the well documented effects of rotenone inhibition On closer inspection however, although all three treatments resulted initially in decreased OCR values compared to baseline measurements taken just minutes apart, only ATP caused sustained decreases throughout the experiment while neither Nigercin- nor MSU.induced respiration recovered significantly even though recovery occurred rapidly if added back together again (Figs 4a, b and S1a †). Interestingly despite having lower basal oxygen consumption than unstimulated samples, CCCP pre-incubation did result in increased maximal respiratory capacity relative to resting state indicating uncoupling had indeed happened (Fig. A number of observations made above suggested that loss of oxidative phosphorylation preceded glycolysis shutdown. First, oligomycin inhibited proton pumping leading to reduced ΔΨ across mitochondria resulting in diminished electron transport chain function without affecting overall energy output measured indirectly as ECAR (Fig. Given recent evidence showing succinate accumulation due to impaired TCA cycle enzyme activities leads to enhanced HIF signalling Finally since pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitors like DCA promote conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to acetyl CoA thereby increasing substrate availability for OXPHOS It has previously been reported that high concentrations of lactate inhibit hexokinase thus preventing entry of substrates directly upstream of phosphofructokinase Therefore whilst many aspects remain unclear about why pyroptotic BMDMs do so show altered bioenergetic profiles, nevertheless analysis reveals clear defects downstream of complex I blockade consistent with impairment of aerobic oxidation pathways rather than enhancement of anaerobic fermentation processes. Furthermore because LDH release occurs much more slowly then cytochrome c leakage, we conclude that early events occur independently of apoptosis execution pathway engagement. Taken altogether, these data indicate that primary BMDM cultures contain populations capable of responding differently depending on specific type of activating agent present. Whilst future investigations should aim to identify additional factors involved in mediating differential outcomes, current knowledge already indicates involvement of multiple components acting simultaneously making them difficult targets for pharmacological intervention.
