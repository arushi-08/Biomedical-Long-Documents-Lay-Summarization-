 roles in sulfur cycling by both hosts and their associated viromes.IMPORTANCE The ocean harbors one third of Earth's biomass on average; however, only 2% -3 0% originates as primary production through photosynthesis or respiration coupled via electron transport chains involving O2 − • generation at oxic surface waters. Oxygen depletion creates an anaerobic environment characterized primarily by sulfate reduction followed by sulfide oxidation into elemental S °. This process produces H2S which can be toxic if not removed efficiently during anoxic conditions when microbes become metabolically dependent upon it. Sulfide oxidizers have been shown recently to rely heavily on virally mediated horizontal gene transfer mechanisms such as CRISPR interference systems to maintain stable populations under high levels of environmental stress. Here, using metagenomic analyses combined with experimental approaches including fluorescence microscopy imaging techniques, our results show evidence suggesting long term persistence of highly diverse microvirid phages infecting uncultured members of Marine Roseobacter Group II (MRG IIe) inhabiting sulfidic sediments beneath the oxygenated water column below the euphotic layer. These data support previous studies showing enrichment of Sulfurovum spp. following exposure to low dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations likely resulting from phage predation pressure. Our work also provides novel insights regarding potential interactions among different types of DNA viruses coexisting together over time periods exceeding several months: some may cooperate whereas others compete each other out. We propose here two possible scenarios based on observed patterns of coexistence - either there exists selection favoring cooperative behavior amongst coexistent groups leading toward increased fitness benefits conferred by coinfection events vs. competition being driven solely towards individual group extinction given limited resources available per virion type present. Additionally, we hypothesize that persistent presence of lytic bacteriophages could play important role in maintaining metabolic activity of key players involved in biogeochemical cycles like those responsible for iron uptake across multiple trophic layers thereby contributing significantly to global nutrient recycling rates especially considering its relatively small genome size compared to cellular counterparts. Overall, understanding complex relationships underlying population structure will help us better understand ecological processes governing energy flow pathways along various ecosystems spanning oceans' major biogeographic zones thus providing critical information needed to improve models predicting future changes affecting coastal seas worldwide. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Microbial life thrives largely because they possess vast genetic diversity enabling them to adapt rapidly To date, numerous methods were developed aiming to isolate pure cultures containing rare microorganisms Although many advances had occurred since then, isolation efforts still lag behind what would otherwise seem feasible Based on recent reports demonstrating existence of abundant yet unknown bacterial lineages belonging to Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) Despite significant progress made so far, culturing strategies continue struggling to capture sufficient numbers of organisms required to enable detailed characterization of newly discovered taxa A more comprehensive picture about abundance distribution pattern of known species remains elusive despite decades worth effort. For example, estimates range widely depending on sampling location ranging up to thousands of cells mL -1 While culture independent surveys offer unparalleled opportunities to investigate community composition without any bias introduced by selective pressures imposed by laboratory growth media, current methodologies suffer limitations related mainly to lack of appropriate tools allowing detection of very few copies of target genes Among all currently described prokaryotic phyla, Bacteria appear particularly enriched in sequences encoding proteins homologous to tailed double stranded bacteriophage structural components Most importantly though, even after accounting for biases inherent to sample preparation procedures, sequencing depth alone does not fully account for differences seen in relative abundances reported by molecular versus traditional microbiological analysis Thus, although considerable advancements have already taken place, further improvements need to take advantage of next generations technologies capable of overcoming technical challenges posed by extremely large datasets generated by modern genomics platforms. As discussed above, development of improved protocols has enabled rapid expansion of genomic databases, opening unprecedented possibilities to explore unexplored niches occupied by poorly studied prokaryotes Recent discoveries concerning prevalence of giant viruses in aquatic environments prompted reconsideration of old paradigms describing exclusive dependence of eukaryotic phytoplankton on phagotrophic protists Giant viruses represent another class of nucleocytoplasmic Large Double Stranded RNA Virus (NCLDV) comprising three families -Marseilleviridae, Megaviduloidea and Iridoviridae Interestingly enough, almost half of sequenced isolates belong to Mimiridae family whose prototype member Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus infects unicellular eukaryotes It should be noted again that no cultivated representatives exist today for nearly 4 8 million year evolutionary history separating Archaea and Eukaryotes Last decade witnessed emergence of massive amounts of sequence reads deposited in public database Unraveling hidden aspects pertaining ecology and evolution requires integration of complementary lines of investigation encompassing classical microbiology, biochemistry, genetics, bioinformatics, phylogenetics etc. With respect to marine habitats, knowledge gained mostly comes from investigations focusing exclusively on cultured strains Isolated from natural samples include aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi phylum Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria Gammaproteobacteria Alphaproteobacteraceae Family Rhodospirillae Order Chromatiale Class Ectothiorhodospirlida Class Epsilonbacteraeota Domain Prochlorococcus genus Pseudoalteromonas Species Within Virosphere realm, cyanophages dominate numerically in terms of number of assembled scaffolds and protein coding regions Comparative phylogenetic tree constructed utilizing concatenated amino acid
