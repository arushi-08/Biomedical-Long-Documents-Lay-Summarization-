 quiescent state transitions through its dual roles as both transcription repressor during proliferation phase and activator at early stages after entering quiescence. Our results suggest new mechanisms underlying transition from proliferative growth stage back toward terminal neuronal fate specification / exit point before initiating dormancy program. This work also provides insights on potential therapeutic strategies targeting Pros pathway activation using small molecules against cancer types with high frequency of PROMPT expression such as glioblastoma multiforme tumors [1 – 3].

These regions give rise not only neurons throughout life via symmetric divisions of radial glia type I NSC population residing there, they generate intermediate precursors known as Type II astrocytes which undergo further rounds of amplification prior differentiating into mature functional neuron progeny upon exiting their niche environment under normal physiological conditions. However, it has become clear over recent years that many other areas outside subventricular zone germinal layers harbor active pools of endogenous postnatal NSPCs including dentate gyrus subgranular layer region of hippocampus, olfactory bulb subependymal area, hypothalamus arcuate nuclei, rostral migratory stream corridors, etc.. It was recently shown that human hippocampal tissue contains resident populations of putative NSPC capable of generating all major classes of excitatory projection neurons found in healthy adults suggesting conservation across species regarding fundamental properties governing maintenance versus generation of different subtypes of cortical interneurons. Therefore understanding intrinsic regulatory pathways controlling homeostatic balance among various modes of cellular behavior will be critical towards developing novel regenerative therapies aimed at restoring lost function following injury or disease affecting specific CNS compartments like spinal cord injuries, stroke, traumatic head trauma, Parkinson ’ s Disease, Alzheimer's diseases etc. characterized by progressive neurodegeneration associated with impaired production of newly generated inhibitory GABAergic interneuron subtype progenies derived primarily from local forebrain SVZ astroglia- and oligodendrocyte precursor cell- driven lineage progression events occurring postnatally rather than embryonic development processes involving pluripotent epiblast origin germ line lineages giving rise directly to neuroepithelial linage derivatives destined exclusively to produce glutamatergic pyramidal motor output neurons projecting axons out ventrally away from ventricular surface. Although much progress had already made identifying key extrinsic signals regulating overall process dynamics involved in maintaining homeostasis in vivo, our knowledge about intracellular networks orchestrating complex developmental programs leading up to final maturation steps culminating in formation of fully differentiated postmitotic outputs still remain limited despite extensive studies conducted so far focusing mainly around identification of core sets of genes expressed specifically either inside dividing vs. noncycling glial progentive- vs terminally differentiated- subsets respectively. For example, although several groups identified some common regulators important for proper control of mitotic activity required for balancing stemness features while promoting timely onset of post mitosis phases necessary for appropriate execution of subsequent step wise maturational sequence driving full acquisition of distinct fates characteristic of each particular class of functionally diverse daughter neurone phenotypes observed in vitro culture systems recapitulating sequential changes seen naturally taking place once newborn immature NPCs leave their respective microenvironment en route to becoming more committed yet less plastic astroglial progenitorial intermediates transitioning eventually onto stable astrocyte morphologies displaying progressively restricted multipotency characteristics ultimately acquiring definitive identities typical of bona fide astrocytic intermediate- and late proneural- phenotype defined here according to criteria established previously. A number of reports suggested existence of similar transitional windows wherein transient presence of certain proneural gene products were reported essential for switching off alternative potentialities acquired earlier in time allowing them to acquire later ones defining those same phenotypic traits displayed intrinsically programmed de novo downstream in parallel without any additional requirement for continued action of upstream positive acting determinants. Such observations led us hypothesize whether one could identify candidate master regulator proteins whose activities would allow initiation of dormant G0 arrest mechanism thereby preventing premature termination of NPC cycle resulting in irreversible commitment to terminal neuronal destiny regardless if initial choice remained stochastic due simply being dictated stochastically given enough opportunity to do otherwise. To test this hypothesis, we focused initially on characterizing transcriptome profiles corresponding to actively growing primary cultured wild type third instar wandering larvae central nervous system (CNSs) compared to freshly isolated ex situ aged 3rd instars non-synchronized whole body dissociated samples enriched for GFP + ve undifferentiated INP subset expressing pros mRNA endogenously tagged together with bratGAL4 driver transgene used herein. As expected, comparison revealed significant downregulation of transcripts encoding components belonging mostly to GO terms linked to general metabolism indicating successful isolation procedure yielding relatively pure fractions containing predominantly undivided mitotically inactive GMCs harboring no detectable BrdU incorporation indicative of lack of S Phase DNA synthesis marker PCNA transcript abundance relative to total poly adenylated mRNAs present therein.
