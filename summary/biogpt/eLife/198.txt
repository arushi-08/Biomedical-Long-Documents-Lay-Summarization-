 regeneration after acute damage or chronic aging induced by exercise training. These results identify an important role for posttranscriptional regulation mediated through triesteprin as part of signaling pathways controlling skeletal myogenesis. This work also demonstrates proof of principle using genetic manipulation with small molecules targeting key regulatory genes within stem cell niches can be used therapeutically to promote regenerative responses under conditions where endogenous progenitor populations have been compromised (Figure 1). The ability to manipulate cellular behavior at multiple levels provides opportunities not only to enhance normal physiological processes but may even enable new approaches designed specifically toward treating disease states associated with impaired function such as cancer metastasis [2 0 – 2 4]. In addition to its potential therapeutic applications, our approach has broad implications beyond musculoskeletal biology because it is likely applicable across many different tissues including those derived from embryonic progenitors like hematopoietic stem cells.We anticipate future studies will reveal additional examples whereby manipulating other components of signal transduction networks could lead to similar outcomes without requiring exogenous delivery systems capable of delivering nucleic acids into target organs throughout life span. For example, modulating protein phosphorylation status might allow one to bypass issues related to stability while still achieving desired effects on downstream targets. Furthermore, since microRNAs regulate diverse biological functions they represent another class of promising candidates whose modulation would require less invasive methods than direct administration strategies involving DNA vectors. Finally, given recent advances demonstrating successful reprogramming of somatic fibroblasts directly towards pluripotent state bypassing intermediate stages present between pluripotency induction protocols currently being developed, there exists tremendous opportunity to use chemical compounds alone instead of transcription factors delivered exogenously thereby avoiding some safety concerns inherent when working out complex developmental programs required for generating functional adult organ derivatives ex vivo.Overall, understanding molecular events regulating postnatal development represents critical steps forward both clinically and biologically; however much remains unknown about underlying principles governing lineage specification decisions made early postnatally before becoming fully integrated into mature organisms. Understanding fundamental aspects regarding maintenance versus disruption of homeostatic control over proliferation vs. apoptosis balance allows us to envision novel interventions aimed either promoting healthy growth trajectories rather than accelerating age dependent decline seen today. Such efforts should ultimately help prevent diseases linked to aberrant proliferative capacity e.g. cancers arising due to mutations affecting tumor suppressors or oncogenes coupled with accelerated senescence observed in certain types of tumors resulting from telomere attrition leading eventually to premature death if left untreated.. Similarly, identifying ways to reverse loss of homeostasis caused by excessive oxidative stress offers hope against degenerative disorders characterized primarily by increased reactive oxygen species production i.e. Parkinson ’ s Disease, Alzheimer's Dementia etc... Our study suggests that pharmacological intervention directed solely at enhancing survival signals emanating form activated resident mesenchymal stromal precursor pools holds promise for improving health care quality worldwide especially considering current lack of effective treatments available thus far despite significant investment invested globally. While further investigation needs to address whether systemic treatment regimens based exclusively on activating local precursors improves overall health- well-being.It seems clear now more broadly speaking though that developing therapeutics targeted at restoring proper microenvironmental cues hold great promises particularly for addressing unmet medical need stemming largely from poor efficacy encountered so often with conventional therapies focused predominantly around inhibiting pathological activity. Given growing evidence suggesting beneficial roles played by various subsets of MSCs residing outside bone marrow compartment, harnessing MSC plasticity along with identification of appropriate markers defining distinct subpopulations representing unique lineages shall facilitate discovery process allowing better characterization of each subpopulation prior to clinical translation. As discussed above, several groups recently reported isolation of multipotent human adipose derived stem cells exhibiting multipotency comparable to--albeit lower than--the widely accepted criteria established originally byInternational Society for Cellular Therapy. However, careful consideration must always bear in mind that all reports published herein-- regardless oftheiroriginals--rely heavily ondata generated utilizing mouse models wherein murine counterparts do exhibit higher degree oflymphopoietic reconstitution capability compared withhumans. Therefore caution ought to prevail until conclusions drawn therefromperforce applied universally onto humanscondition management practices unless proven otherwise experimentally. Nonetheless, taking advantage of knowledge gained studying natural mammalian model organism physiology combined wih high throughput screening technologies offer exciting possibilities fortranslating basic discoveries obtained preventively in mice back safely into clinic setting providing improved patient outcome rates. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃
