 tools for understanding human history at fine scale (Figure 1). The results presented here have implications not only on our knowledge about modern humans but also more broadly: they highlight potential problems associated with using uniparental marker panels alone when studying ancient DNA or reconstructing past demographic events such as migration patterns among ethnic / religious communities living today around Africa. For example, we find evidence suggesting some East Yoruba samples may represent admixed descendants who were originally part of either North Nigeria's Igbo tribe or southern Bantu tribes; however it is important note all three clusters contain members belonging exclusively to one group indicating there was little overlap amongst them before any major migrations occurred during prehistoric times. This finding highlights the importance of including multiple loci throughout genomes instead of relying solely upon single locus analyses like Y chromosome haplogroups because each haplogroup has its own unique evolutionary histories making inferences difficult without considering other lineages present simultaneously [2 3 – 2 5]. Finally, by providing information regarding ancestral relationships through genomic data sets, researchers will better understand what makes certain people so well adapted to life under extreme conditions while others do poorly despite having similar ancestries. As global health initiatives seek ways to improve access to medical care worldwide especially those located near resource limited settings where infectious diseases remain prevalent, knowing whether particular genes contribute towards disease resistance versus susceptibility could help guide future efforts aimed at improving treatment options against specific pathogens depending on individual ’ s ethnicity. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > To investigate variation underlying differences observed in response rates following malaria infection, we genotyped 4 8diverse Sub-Sahara African participants recruited via flyers distributed nationally representing six distinct ethnolinguistic regions spanning four countries - Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya and Tanzania (Table S1 & S2). Participants provided written informed consent prior to participation after being briefed extensively concerning study procedures involving blood sampling followed by sample storage until time of genotyping. All protocols received approval from local ethics committees according to national guidelines. Genomic DNAs extracted from whole peripheral venous bloods collected directly onto EDTA tubes underwent quality control measures described previously. Briefly, SNPs selected included 9 6 autosomal short tandem repeat polymorphisms plus X Chromosome STRs DXS8 3 7 8A and GATA1 6D0 5A designed specifically for forensic applications. Samples passing QC had call rate ≥ 9 5% per SNP tested except Xp STR DXS7 1 3 2D whose average success rate dropped below acceptable threshold given high heterozygosity values obtained from previous studies conducted elsewhere. A total number of ~ 2million genotypes passed final filtering out leaving us with approximately 1billion possible combinations resulting from pairwise comparisons made between every pair of subjects analysed herein. These pairs consisted mostly of males sampled together although females represented nearly half of the dataset thus allowing inference of sex biases if applicable. Pairwise identity disequilibrium statistics computed separately for male vs. female subsets revealed significant departure away from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium expectations particularly evident in Tanzanian women compared to men (P =.0 0 0 1 Mann Whitney U test corrected for False Discovery Rate FDR q value ≤.1) likely reflecting differential selection pressures acting differently than expected between sexes since many traits differ significantly betweengenders e.g. skin colour etc.. Principal component Analysis performed independently for males vs females showed clear separation consistent with known gender bias affecting allele frequencies thereby confirming successful stratification post QC steps (Figures S1A & S1B respectively). < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Haplotype phasing algorithms implemented in PHASE v2. 1.1 package allowed reconstruction of unphased genotype calls corresponding to common chromosomal segments segregating jointly in several unrelated persons. Haplotypes inferred individually then served as input files for subsequent calculations requiring estimates of linkage disequilibria coefficients r ^ ij calculated assuming independent assortment processes i.e. identical gametes produced randomly rather than non random ones. Linkage disequilibrium matrices constructed accordingly enabled estimation of intra-haplotypic LD parameters D ′ and R 2 indices depicted graphically alongside principal components plots generated from matrix coordinates plotted ordinally relative to distance separating adjacent blocks defined algorithmically above. Population differentiation metrics FST estimated inter-populational divergence accounting for recombination effects whereas RST statistic measured overall similarity between subpopulations grouped hierarchically by geography. Both tests yielded highly concordant outputs showing strong correlation coefficient values ranging from.8 5to.9 9.However, unlike F st metric, RST measure does account implicitly forgametic phase information.The proportion ofvariance explained byQ − Statisticswas.7 3and.6 3.When comparing mean squared error errors achieved by various models fitted to empirical observations, Akaike Information Criterion AIC indicated best fit model chosen corresponded closely to HKY + I nucleotide substitution model.This approach identified five primary axes explaining almost ¾ of phenotypic variability captured by PCA plot shown diagrammed next to multidimensional scaling representation depicting first axis orthogonal distances spanned amongsubgroups.Three large groupings emerged comprising mainly eastern Nigerian, western Kenyan and central Ugandans separated further apart inturn by Kisii speakers residing primarily offshore islands bordering Lake Victoria basin south east of Uganda. Another cluster comprised predominantly Sudanese pastoralists
