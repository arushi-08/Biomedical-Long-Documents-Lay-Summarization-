 may help us understand more about what constitutes an individual's connectome than just their resting state networks alone (see also).Our results suggest caution when interpreting differences across subjects or groups based on fMRI data without considering possible effects from inter regional interactions within each region. In particular, our work suggests it would be useful for future investigations into group comparisons involving large numbers of participants if they were able to consider both intra - versus extra cranial connections separately rather then only those connecting two different areas together. This could potentially reduce false positives arising due to spurious correlations caused by common factors such as head motion during scanning. Furthermore, while there has been much interest recently regarding whether specific structural features can predict behavioural performance – e.g. grey matter density predicts fluid intelligence; here we show no relationship exists at all between any aspect of structure measured using diffusion MRI tractography techniques nor does white matter microstructure relate significantly to cognitive ability scores even after controlling for age. These observations highlight important limitations associated with current approaches towards characterising human brains: whilst some aspects of anatomy do appear related to cognition, other anatomical characteristics cannot explain variation beyond general intellectual abilities per se. It will therefore remain challenging until researchers develop new methods capable not merely identifying relationships but predicting behaviours directly through multivariate analysis models incorporating information relating to whole person personalities including personality traits like extraversion / introversion.This article contains supplementary material online. Additional file 1: Figure S1. A schematic representation showing the experimental design employed throughout this study. The figure shows schematically where potential confounding variables might affect analyses comparing task vs. rest conditions. Please note that although most experiments involve one condition type i.e. either stimulus presentation or periods off fixation, several types exist whereby stimuli occur randomly interspersed amongst periods of quiet baseline looking away from anything else around the screen. Examples include trials consisting solely of passive viewing tasks whereas others incorporate active paradigms requiring attention allocation [3 6].The experiment was designed so that every participant completed three separate runs comprising four blocks containing 2 0 s epochs alternating between stimulation and rest phases respectively. Each block consisted of five consecutive presentations followed immediately afterwards by another 5 0s period before starting again anew. Blocks lasted approximately 4 min total duration except for the first run wherein half of them took place over 8 minutes. Participants had sufficient time available following completion of the second session allowing further sessions up till six times depending upon availability. See Methods section below for details concerning statistical testing procedures applied post hoc. Table S2. Demographic Information Related to Subjects Enrolled in Study. Mean values ± SD obtained via self report questionnaires pertaining to demographics along with mean psychometric test battery score distributions according to gender and IQ category. Note that missing responses did arise mainly because certain tests required full response options given prior knowledge of the nature of the questions posed. However, since none occurred systematically enough among demographic categories, subsequent statistics concerned means calculated overall across genders and IQS levels. Results presented refer specifically to males who scored above average I.Q. level.
