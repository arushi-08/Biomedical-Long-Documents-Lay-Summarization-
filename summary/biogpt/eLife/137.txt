 can be provided in Supplementary Information (Text S1) for further development or refinement as appropriate. We also show here using simulations with our validated kinetic mechanism that it may not always follow intuition when comparing rates measured under different conditions: differences observed could arise either due to changes in substrate concentration at steady state rather than actual change in catalytic turnover number per se but more likely through variations in affinity constants governing binding / unbinding.This article has earned an Open Data Badge For making publicly available data open access should therefore be considered possible so long as necessary documentation relating to the original work being made public transparently.To view articles published online on eLife's website http: / / www.biomedcentral.com / 1 7 4 2-6 9 0 5 / 8 / 3 ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Protein homeostasis maintains proteome integrity via balanced synthesis and destruction of proteins In eukaryotic cells most intracellular proteolysis occurs within two major pathways -ubiquitin dependent proteosomal pathway which degrades short lived ubiquitinated Proteins targeted for ubiquitination bind directly to one of several E3 ligases whose specificity determines their subsequent fate Our understanding of both general principles underlying catalysis by proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin like enzymes As well as providing insight about fundamental aspects of protease function there have been many recent studies exploring specific applications including drug design A variety of computational approaches exist for studying enzymatic reactions However, despite considerable effort efforts they remain challenging computationally owing largely to difficulties associated with sampling large conformational spaces during molecular simulation These challenges notwithstanding, significant progress towards elucidating structure based kinetics parameters describing ligand induced activation transitions in serine hydrolases There remains much debate regarding whether allosteric regulation involves global structural rearrangements or local perturbations around active site residues It was recently shown that allostery does indeed involve concerted movements across multiple subunits This study aims first to establish if detailed information concerning individual steps involved in ATP driven peptide bond cleavage events can help explain why certain peptides appear preferentially degraded while others do not.The second aim will then focus attention onto determining what factors determine selectivity among potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Specifically, given current interest in targeting immunoproteasomes for cancer therapy One important aspect of designing selective inhibitors against particular isoforms of the proteasome is ensuring sufficient potency without compromising other functions critical for cell survival e.g. inhibition of constitutive proteasome leads to apoptosis While previous theoretical investigations focused mainly on identifying optimal sequences required for efficient recognition By combining experiments with mathematical modeling we hope ultimately to gain insights useful beyond those obtained previously and thus improve future rational inhibitor designs. First, we demonstrate proof ofprinciple showing that accurate measurements of initial reaction velocities enable determination of Michaelis Menten constant K M values even though some components cannot reach equilibrium rapidly enough to allow full saturation. Second, we apply mass spectrometry techniques developed elsewhere to measure absolute concentrations of all species present throughout each experiment allowing us to construct comprehensive quantitative descriptions of system behaviour. Third, we employ stochastic methods to simulate realistic trajectories starting from random configurations taken randomly from Boltzmann distributions representing ensemble averages calculated according to standard statistical mechanics theory Finally, we perform extensive parameter sensitivity analyses guided by prior knowledge derived primarily from literature sources to identify biologically meaningful relationships amongst unknown variables. Through systematic variation of input quantities we examine robustness properties inherent to any complex biological process involving multi component systems where stoichiometry plays crucial roles. Thus far no rigorous method exists capable of simultaneously quantifying contributions arising from various interacting elements comprising biochemical networks.
