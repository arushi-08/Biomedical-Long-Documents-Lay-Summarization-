 gradients along both proximal / distal axes within an organ: the developing eye disk or pupal notum. Thus, graded distributions of FGFs generated via cell migration can be interpreted differently depending on their target tissues due to differential regulation between two antagonistic transcriptional regulators acting downstream of FGFRs during development. This study provides insights into understanding molecular mechanism underlying generation of distinct protein patterns required for pattern recognition across different organs using similar patterning molecules but operating under diverse regulatory systems involving opposing developmental genes controlling cellular behaviors such as directional guidance mediated by filopodia extension. ▃ ▃ ▃ Editorial note ▃ For more information see page 1 0 7 9 in vol. 2 3. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
