 may function as an innate immune defense against mobile genetic elements such as retrotransposons within mammalian host cells.IMPORTANCE Retrotransposons pose significant threats for genome integrity because they generate mutations at their insertion sites through reverse transcription followed by genomic reincorporation into new locations via homologous recombination with other retrotransposon sequences; however, there exist cellular mechanisms designed specifically to restrict retroelement activity inside infected hosts' nuclei. One important restriction factor identified recently was APOBEC3G / 3F from humans: it catalyzes cytosine nucleotide conversion on retroviral RNA templates before cDNA synthesis occurs but does so inefficiently when viral cDNAs become integrated back into chromosomal DNAs after infection takes place. In contrast, another enzyme called apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide 3G acts more effectively once proviral integrations occur due its ability to bind directly to integrase proteins associated with newly synthesized retrovirus particles prior to nuclear entry where provirus formation ensues. We show here that one member of the APOBEC protein subfamily also restricts transposable nucleic acid parasites like retroviruses using similar biochemical principles involving transient exposure of target site cytosines while undergoing replication processes rather than binding stably only upon completion of transposition reactions per se. This work provides insight regarding possible evolutionary origins underlying functional similarities between different members of the AID superfamily involved both in adaptive immunity responses toward foreign pathogens including viruses and nonself somatic hypermutation activities leading to antibody diversification among vertebrates. It further suggests potential therapeutic applications targeting APOBECs acting similarly across diverse species ranging over millions of years since divergence up until present day Homo sapiens. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
