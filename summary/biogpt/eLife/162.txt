 role played by LECs during early stages of tumor cell extravasation at secondary sites through regulation of MMP1 4--β1- integrin-- NOTCH3 signaling axis; thus providing new insights into cancer biology as well as potential therapeutic targets against late stage disease progression.

Although surgical resection is effective when diagnosed before regional spread occurs, once it happens patients have very limited treatment options due largely to lack of targeted therapies available so far. In addition, there remains no reliable prognostic marker capable of predicting which patient will develop recurrent loco-regionally advanced lesions after surgery alone versus those who may benefit more effectively from adjuvant therapy such radiation treatments plus chemotherapy vs. immunotherapy regimens including anti PD-L1 antibodies like pembrolizumab etc.. Thus novel biomarkers need urgent development if better outcomes can be achieved following radical excision surgeries combined with systemic interventions targeting key pathways involved in melanomagenesis and its subsequent recurrence. It should also take advantage of emerging technologies allowing direct visualization of individual circulating tumour DNA molecules present within blood samples obtained non-surgically prior to any intervention aimed at preventing relapse. Such approaches could help identify high risk individuals whose tumours would likely metastasize even without evidence of overt local recurrences post initial removal thereby enabling earlier initiation of appropriate preventive measures than currently practiced based solely upon physical examination results. Furthermore, understanding why some cancers recur while others do not--and what factors contribute thereto--in order to design rational combination strategies involving both conventional therapeutics along side newer agents designed specifically towards blocking specific oncogenic drivers implicated in each case holds great promise toward improving long term survival rates among affected populations. One promising approach involves identification of genes expressed differentially between metastasizing vs nonmetastasising subtypes using large scale genomic analyses coupled together with functional studies performed under controlled conditions mimicking their natural microenvironment where they arise naturally e.g. ex vivo culturing them directly onto organotypic three dimensional matrices containing stromal components followed by implantation back subcutaneously either orthotopically or intravenously. While informative about intrinsic differences amongst various types of malignancies one must keep cognizant however that most experimental systems used involve manipulation rather then recapitulation of events occurring physiologically i.e. inside living organisms since many important features distinguishing normal tissues form neoplasms occur only later in life making extrapolation difficult especially given our current inability to manipulate genomes experimentally outside intact animals. Nevertheless, despite all limitations inherent to model system designs detailed above several groups recently reported successful use of mouse xenograft models employing genetically engineered murine melanocytes expressing mutant BRAF V6 0E driven by melanocyte lineage restricted tyrosinase promoter driving expression of Cre recombinase leading to formation of autochthonous melanocytic neoplasia resembling common acquired nevi progressing via benign nevus → dysplastic naevus transition → radial growth phase = vertical growth phase----eventually culminating in highly aggressive visceral metastases.The authors showed that loss of PTEN function accelerated tumorigenesis whereas concurrent deletion of INK4A suppressed proliferation resulting in increased apoptosis compared to control group carrying wild type alleles of Pten + Ink4a suggesting distinct roles for PI3K pathway deregulation vis à visa.Deletion ofp1 6ink4a resulted instead in enhanced invasiveness associated with reduced E cadherin levels indicating possible involvement of EMT program similar to observations made previously in other settings wherein TGF β induces epithelial mesenchymal transitions characterized by down modulation of adherens junctions proteins accompanied by up regulated N Cadherin expressions.These data suggest critical importance of studying genetic alterations affecting multiple cellular processes simultaneously taking place concurrently throughout carcinogenesis process particularly considering complex interactions existing betweenmicroenvironmental cues and transformed cells` behavior. Indeed, numerous reports indicate significant influence exerted by surrounding stroma constituents namely fibroblasts, immune infiltrates etc. on neoplastic transformation and aggressiveness of developing tumors.1 Therefore future work needs careful consideration regarding choice of animal host species employed for experiments aiming to recapitulate aspects pertinent to particular steps of multistage carcinogenesis.2 For example, although orthotopic transplantation assays allow assessment of tumorigenic properties exhibited by transplanted cells grown atop native tissue architecture akin closely to physiological situation encountered in vivo.3 On another hand subcutaneous injection does not permit investigation of effects emanating out of interaction between implanted tumours`s own vasculature network andrecipient's vascular bed because neither lymphatics nor capillaries exist normally beneath skin surface except around hair follicles located just below epidermis layer. As mentioned already, unlike solid carcinomas arising primarily from epithelia lining internal organs mammary gland carcinoma arises predominantly de novo from neural crest derived multipotent progenitor stem cells residing deep underneath dermis layers called “milk line ”.4 Hence generation of transgenic strains harboring conditional mutations activating oncogenes selectively confined exclusively to neuroectoderm derivatives might prove useful forfurther
