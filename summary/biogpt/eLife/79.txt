 contributes significantly to autoimmunity caused by impaired TCR signal transduction via RasGRP1. These results highlight both positive (e.g., elevated basal mTORC1 activity) and negative effects [i.e., decreased antigen receptor responsiveness] for altered levels or duration of mTORC signals during immune system development and homeostasis. This study also demonstrates utility of combining forward genetics approaches such as N-ethyl nitrosourea mutagenesis screens with reverse immunology strategies like CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing technologies toward understanding complex biological processes at multiple scales from molecular mechanisms down to organismal phenotypes. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > autoimmune disease models, RASGRF1 mutations, helper effector memory phenotype CD8 + T lymphocytes, lymphocyte subsets, rapamycin treatment experiments, quantitative proteomics analysis, mass spectrometry data processing pipeline, bioinformatics analyses tools, statistical methods used throughout manuscript text review section < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > The RAS guanyl releasing protein family member RASGRP3 has been implicated recently using exome sequencing studies linked directly to primary immunodeficiency diseases characterized primarily by recurrent infections but not lymphoproliferation nor other features associated more generally with common variable immunodeficiencies including agammaglobulinemia due to Brutons ’ s tyrosine kinase- deficiency; however no cases have yet reported lymphoproliferative disorders characteristic of patients carrying germline loss-of- -function alleles affecting components downstream of LAT or ZAP7 0 adaptor proteins required upstream of RASGPS3. In contrast, heterozygous de novo gain-offunction somatic point mutants were identified within exon 2 3 encoding part of its CDC2 5 domain causing constitutive GEF catalytic activities leading to enhanced ERK1 / ERK2 phosphorylation upon stimulation compared to wild type controls. Patients harboring activating KRAS G1 2D hotspot substitutions present clinically similar symptoms consistent with those observed here involving constitutively active forms of RAS1 isoforms encoded by two distinct genes termed rasGrf1 and ras 2gap1 respectively which share 8 6% amino acid identity across their respective coding regions. Although it remains unclear whether any specific clinical manifestations can be attributed specifically to either gene product given overlapping functions between them, our work suggests caution should perhaps apply when interpreting patient outcomes based solely on sequence information alone since different residues may contribute differentially depending on cellular contexts where they operate under physiological conditions versus pathological states driven largely by oncogenic transformation events occurring later after birth. Our identification of additional rare non-synonymous single base pair changes predicted deleterious to protein structure will help clarify potential functional differences among various allelic variations found so far only once each time in humans suggesting possible roles beyond simple loss- vs. gains-of-function.While some aspects of murine physiology differ substantially relative to corresponding characteristics seen in children affected by analogous syndromes arising naturally owing to germ line defects resulting in partial rather than complete abrogation of critical pathways involved in immunity – most notably thymic output rates — others do overlap considerably enough allowing us to use animal model systems effectively even if one cannot predict precisely what degree of impairment would result physiologically akin to natural hypomorphic situations described above.. Thus while there remain many challenges inherent in translating observations made about individuals suffering from severe combined immunodeficient syndrome into effective therapies designed ultimately aimed towards correcting underlying causes, careful consideration must always accompany experimental design whenever considering appropriate preclinical testing paradigms before moving ahead therapeutically targeting candidate molecules suspected causal behind abnormal immunological responses detected incidentally following whole exomic screening efforts. It seems likely therefore prudent now to consider carefully selected combinations of complementary techniques ranging back up to unbiased high throughput genomic DNA resequencing followed immediately thereafter by targeted validation steps employing well established knock out technology along side newly emerging next generation RNA interference knockdown methodologies coupled together with sophisticated flow cytometric phenotyping assays capable of detecting subtle alterations in key parameters governing lymphoid lineage commitment decisions early in life prior to onset of overt pathology. Such considerations could prove particularly important going forwards because recent reports suggest certain types of cancer treatments themselves might inadvertently promote aberrant differentiation programs driving undesirable inflammatory pathologies known collectively as “therapy related myeloid neoplasms ” often manifesting months post chemotherapy administration especially amongst elderly people who already suffer significant co morbidities making long term follow ups difficult without invasive procedures requiring hospitalization. Given growing evidence linking chronic inflammation itself strongly predisposes older adults to developing frank malignancy, further investigation regarding potentially adverse consequences stemming from therapeutic interventions intended initially to correct defective innate sensing capabilities intrinsic to hematopoietic stem progenitor populations responsible for generating adaptive immune repertoires appears warranted. Indeed several groups working independently utilizing diverse genetically engineered strains exhibiting spontaneous autoinflammatory immunopathology resembling systemic lupus erythematosus show promise showing beneficial amelioration of signs accompanying drug induced immunosuppression regimens employed routinely against rheumatological indications despite persistent presence of autoreactive antibodies indicative of ongoing autoantibody production indicating failure of tolerance induction checkpoints normally operating late postnatally. A better mechanistic grasp over developmental windows wherein self reactive antibody specificities arise spontaneously then become fixed again soon afterwards becomes increasingly valuable knowing that successful intervention protocols need to take advantage of knowledge gained concerning precise timing whereby particular checkpoint failures occur first thereby avoiding unnecessary exposure periods until definitive corrective measures can begin being implemented earlier instead of waiting longer times past infancy thus risking irreversible damage to vital organs. As mentioned previously, much effort needs still to go forth trying ever harder to
