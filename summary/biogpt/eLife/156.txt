 work on host genes involved with E. muscaeavirulence mechanisms as well as other aspects of insect biology such as feeding or reproduction. This article describes our method - including fly husbandry protocols; inoculation procedures (both topical application onto adult cuticle surface using forceps); sample preparation techniques used during RNA sequencing analysis; data processing steps required prior to differential expression analyses; and statistical approaches employed when analyzing gene lists generated through transcriptomic profiling experiments. © 2 0 1 8 The Authors.
