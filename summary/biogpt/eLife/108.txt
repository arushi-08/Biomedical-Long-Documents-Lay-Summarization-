 by inducing cytokine production via activation of the cGAS / cGAMP signaling axis at early stages after invasion into host cell cytosol. This work provides new insights about innate immune responses against intracellular bacteria such as L. monocytogenes. It also highlights potential roles played by ISG1 5ylation machinery beyond its well characterized antiviral function. Finally it suggests novel therapeutic strategies based either on targeting IFN pathways directly using small molecules inhibitors or enhancing ISG activities indirectly without harming normal cellular functions.

Type II Interferon γ plays important regulatory effects both locally within infected tissues where macrophages play key effector mechanisms together with T lymphocytes secreting IFNγ whereas systemic levels remain low due to tight regulation exerted primarily though negative feedback loops involving suppressor factors including IL ‐ 1 8 binding Protein and soluble IFNγR2 receptor α chain secreted respectively following interaction between INFɣ produced by activated Th1 CD4 + helper lineage cells and their cognate surface membrane bound ligand IL1 8Rα expressed specifically on antigen presenting dendritic cells.1 In contrast IFNα has been shown recently to have direct antimicrobial properties independently of adaptive immunity.2 Indeed IFNβ was found able to inhibit growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis inside macrophages.3 Similarly treatment of mice deficient in major histocompatibility complex class Ia antigens resulted only partially protected when challenged intravenously with Leishmania donovani suggesting additional immunomodulatory effects.4 These observations suggest distinct modes of action depending whether they act alone or combined with other effectors belonging notably to Toll Like Receptors family members involved in sensing microbial components present extracellularly e.g. lipopolysaccharide while others acting intracellularly i.e. nucleic acids recognized by RIG ‐ I helicases TLR7 & TLR8 located predominantly in endosome.5 Interestingly recent studies showed that some viruses evolved specific countermeasures aimed at blocking IRF6- and STAT1 phosphorylation thus preventing downstream transcriptional activation.6 However no evidence yet exists concerning any mechanism allowing inhibition of IRF transcription factor itself once translocated into nucleus despite being essential component required for efficient gene transcription.7 Thus understanding precisely what controls nuclear translocation may help us understand better why pathogens need multiple counter actions since each one might target different steps along signal transduction cascades initiated upstream TLR engagement: endocytosis followed by acidification pH changes necessary for TLRs dimerization then endosomal escape before reaching cytoplasm compartment containing endoplasmic reticulum membranes harboring all enzymes needed for post translational modifications eventually resulting in active forms capable of translocating across plasma membrane.8 Ubiquitination represents perhaps most studied posttranslational modification occurring essentially under physiological conditions regulating many aspects related particularly degradation processes although ubiquitination process seems more versatile than initially thought because several types of polyubiquitin chains exist linked differently according to lysine residue used thereby generating various functional outcomes ranging form proteasome dependant degradations up to non degradative signaling.9 Ubiquitin conjugation involves three classes E1 activating enzyme E2 conjugating enzyme.1 0 E3 ligases catalyze transfer reaction onto substrate lysines providing specificity towards substrates targeted among hundreds identified so far thanks largely to bioinformatics approaches relying first on sequence homology search tools subsequently confirmed experimentally. A large number of E3s were discovered over last decade giving rise to diverse families defined structurally and functionally. Among them RING finger domain bearing ones represent largest group catalyzing formation of covalent bonds linking C terminal glycine residues of Ub molecule covalently attached to ε amino groups of acceptor proteins1 1 finally releasing free Ub1 2 however HECT domains contain catalytic cysteine residues1 3 mediating isopeptide bond linkage forming similar products except requiring ATP hydrolysis step prior ubiquitinylation. c-Cbl ligase contains really interesting genes motif conferring ability to bind phosphorylated tyrosine kinase receptors9.While polyubiquitination usually targets modified proteins destined toward proteasomal destruction, monoubiquitination regulates trafficking events controlling internalization rate of transmembrane transporters and channels playing crucial part in maintaining homeostasis especially ion balance homeostasis.5 Recently emerging evidences indicate that mono ubiquitinated species rather than polyubiquitinated conjugates regulate NF kappa B signalling pathway.1 4,1 5 Moreover there appears growing interest regarding identification of unanchored poly UB chains generated spontaneously even if less understood compared to conjugated polyUBs whose generation requires enzymatic cascade consisting minimally of two sequential reactions catalyzed sequentially by E1s, E2s and1e3 likely reflecting existence of alternative routes bypassing requirement for initial priming event provided byE3s. ubiqitination therefore emerges now as central regulator governing numerous biological processes.5b Recent advances revealed critical importance of K6 3- versus K4 8- linkages formed by attachment of single vs double moieties respectively1 6k possibly explaining differences reported earlier showing opposite consequences for same targets.3 Besides adding complexity further diversity arises given presence of mixed branched structures having unique biophysical properties. b-AP1 5 inhibitor blocks deubiquitinase USP1 7l implicated in stabilization of ERAD components4 highlighting again possible involvement of DUBs in fine tuning control of inflammation triggered by microbes entering cytosoli.5c Here we report unexpected finding revealing dual opposing capacities displayed by human Isg1 5 isoform 1 5a encoded by IFI6 locus encoding ISG1 5.d To date little information existed describing implication of ISG1 5s in antibacterial defense apart reports demonstrating upregulation of ISGs IFIT1
