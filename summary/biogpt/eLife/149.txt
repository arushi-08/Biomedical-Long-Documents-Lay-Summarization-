 can also identify functional sites within individual subunits or domains; we show here its ability to detect allosteric communication between distant regions through multiple pathways by identifying correlated motions among functionally important groups throughout GroEL's ATPase domain upon binding GroES cofactor. The results suggest potential applications ranging from drug design targeting pathogenic bacteria over engineering new enzymes into metabolic networks toward understanding mechanisms underlying disease states involving mutations at specific positions along chains as well as evolutionary changes associated with adaptation under different environmental conditions.

These efforts include both experimental techniques which require large amounts of time consuming effort but often produce high quality data sets containing tens if not hundreds ofexperimentally determined 3D coordinates per assembly andcomputational approaches developed specifically aimed at generating accurate atomistic representations without requiring any prior knowledge regarding their three dimensional organization.One approach includes molecular dynamics simulations where one observes conformational transitions occurring due to thermal fluctuations around equilibrium conformations generated via energy minimization procedures followed bytrajectory generation steps akin toMonte Carlo sampling schemes.The resulting trajectories may then undergo clustering analyses wherein representative conformers corresponding to stable clusters representing distinct metastable configurations were selected out forfurther study. This process allows researchers to generate atomically detailed dynamic descriptions of macromolecules while providing insights related therewithbiochemical properties of interest.This strategy was recently applied successfully to investigate allostery effects induced when ligand binds someother site away fromtheactive center itself.1 Another example involves studies focused onelucidating differences betweenvarious forms of amyloid fibrils formed invitro usingeither wild type transthyretin tetramers ormutant homotetrameric variants having single point mutations.2 While it would seem obvious thatexperiments conducted utilizing only native molecules should yield more reliable conclusions compared to ones performed employing mutated proteinsowing concerns relating to possible artifacts arising because some mutants might exhibit altered aggregation propensities relative to wildtypethey do however still represent valuable tools useful for studying amyloidogenesis mechanisms.3 Computational strategies similar to above mentioned MD simulation protocols though offer significant advantages since no assumptions need being taken concerning moleculardetails except themechanism behind observed phenomena thus allowing experimentalists access to vast quantities of data.4 However, even after all available resources become exhausted, obtaining correct answers remains challenging especially given our limited arsenal offood pertaining to training datasets consisting mostly of solved crystal structures.5 As discussed earlier several factors contribute significantly to making matters worse e.g. lack of sufficient numbers of homologous templates exhibiting sufficiently close similarity to target molecule leading to poor alignment scores obtained following homology modelling.6 Furthermore, although much progress had already gone hand waving off before reaching completion of CASP competitions last year scientists continue looking forward to developing novel algorithmic solutions capable of overcoming current limitations thereby improving accuracy rates achieved hereroly.7 Finally, despite tremendous advancements in computer hardware capabilities coupled with improved algorithms development software developers face challenges posed mainly by scalability.8 Thus far most existing toolkits utilize machine learningprinciples rather thantraditional statistical approaches.9 Here I describe my own attempt wedding state-of-art bioinformatics methodologies together with advanced modern computing technologies to address issues surrounding prediction accuracy.2 My goal herein istwofold — first, develop robust methodology enabling us to accurately model interactions taking place amongst atoms located outside confines imposed by spatial constraints defined by neighboring residues1 0second, demonstrate applicability of newly derived methodologys designed expressinglylower apply them wherever necessary to improve confidence levels attained previously.Figurshuiyo et al. previously reported successful application of Bayesian inference combined with maximum entropy regularization technique to infer interaction energies contributing significantlyto stability of human immunodeficiency virus protease dimer interface. They found that predicted values agree very closely with measured values.1o He etaly showed that incorporating phylogenetic informations improves performance considerably notwithstanding relatively small size of dataset employed comprising five HIV proteases each belonging to group M subtypes A1, A2, B, D and F respectively. Their observations suggested that incorporation of phylogenetically informative features leads to improvement in predictive power suggesting usefulness of phylogentic analysiso.1a To achieve better predictionsin silico mutagenesis programs typically employ mutating certain key side chain moieties thought critical for maintaining interactions.1b For instance, Wang et al. utilized Rosetta program to perform alanine scanning mutational scans considering every position in T4 lysozyme backbone separately and calculated ΔΔG value ascribable to mutation effect. Then authors analyzed distribution patterns of stabilizing versus destabilizing substitutions revealing hotspots
