 for its normal function or toxicity when expanded beyond 3 6 glutamines (ref) 1 0 2 – 1 0 4. We also discuss potential implications from our study with respect to other neurodegenerative diseases caused by abnormal expansions within intrinsically disordered proteins such as Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer ’ s Diseases etc … This article has been published online at http: / / www.circresaha.org. doi: 1 0. 7 5 8 9 / cureus.5 1 7. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Polyglutamine Expansion, Intrinsically Disordered Proteins, Electron Microscopy, Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy, Cross Linking Mass Spectrometry < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Research Highlights < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > What do I see here about my paper? < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > In order to understand why CAG repeat disorders like HD occur only after birth it would be necessary first to know what makes them age dependent pathologies rather than early onset ones associated mostly with mutations affecting enzymes involved directly into metabolism pathways. It was proposed earlier based upon genetic studies that there might exist some protective mechanism against neurodegeneration involving genes whose products were somehow related either functionally or structurally to those responsible for metabolic processes but not necessarily both types of functions simultaneously; however no evidence could support any specific hypothesis until recently. Now several groups have shown conclusively through different approaches that many human polyQ containing polypeptides can form amyloid fibrils under physiological conditions even though they lack sequence homology between themselves []. These observations suggest strongly that amyloids may represent generic structures adopted by all polypeptide chains regardless their primary sequences if appropriate environmental factors present during aging lead to conformational changes allowing formation of β sheets rich aggregates similar to classical prions found exclusively in mammals. Thus far most attention had focused mainly towards understanding structure features underlying aggregation propensity because soluble oligomers formed prior to fibril assembly appear more toxic compared to mature fibrillar species although recent data suggests otherwise depending very much on experimental system used.. Although still controversial whether oligomeric intermediates actually cause cell death remains one important question regarding pathogenesis since accumulation of misfolded monomers over time leads eventually to insoluble deposits consisting primarily of large amounts of aggregated material thus leading ultimately to neuronal dysfunction due to loss of cellular homeostasis resulting finally in degeneration observed clinically. However another possibility exists whereby small amount of monomeric forms escape degradation process thereby accumulating inside cells causing cytotoxicity via non native conformations without forming visible inclusions detectable microscopically while being highly cytotoxic once deposited extracellularly making detection difficult unless special techniques developed specifically targeting extracellular materials become available. Therefore identification of molecular determinants controlling conversion rate determining steps will help us better define mechanisms behind development of pathology especially focusing now largely unexplored role played by intrinsic disorder nature inherent to majority eukaryotic proteomes particularly transcription factor families having high prevalence of IDPs harboring polyQs stretches near N terminus region often referred to as Natively unfolded domain (NUDs). Indeed presence of multiple Q residues close together appears critical enough so long as spacing does not exceed four residue intervals whereas longer distance results in increased tendency toward self association suggesting existence of certain preferred conformation space accessible to each individual chain possibly stabilized by hydrophobic collapse driven forces acting across entire molecule giving rise to globular folded state akin to molten globule states seen frequently amongst IDP family members. Such compact folding allows efficient interaction surface area utilization reducing entropic penalty incurred per contact made hence facilitating rapid binding kinetics relative to extended linear peptides perhaps explaining faster rates of oligomerization reported previously despite lower overall affinity constants measured experimentally. Furthermore unstructured segments allow flexibility needed for recognition events required for proper functioning e.g. DNA bending mediated transcriptional activation versus steric hindrance preventing access to target sites imposed by rigid secondary structured folds typical of functional motifs typically encountered outside ID segment boundaries i.e. alpha helices & beta strands respectively. Finally higher local concentration achieved locally around poly Gln stretch along with absence of bulky side group attached to lysine ε nitrogen atom further facilitates electrostatic attraction driving nucleation event promoting intermolecular contacts essential for subsequent growth step culminating in fibrillization pathway. Since almost every known gene product contains numerous repeats ranging up to- nearly two hundred times throughout proteome except histones histone tails harbor relatively few number of consecutive lysines rendering them less prone to undergo charge neutralization induced compaction effects unlike rest part of molecules leaving open window of opportunity for charged polymers to interact efficiently enabling fast polymerization reactions characteristic feature common to amyloidogenic systems. Taken altogether above mentioned considerations make possible explanation of selective vulnerability pattern exhibited by neurons expressing particular set of transcripts encoding polyQ bearing proteins irrespective of identity of corresponding encoded proteins implying involvement of additional yet unknown regulatory elements besides simple physicochemical parameters governing polymer behavior namely hydrophobicity vs. hydrophilicity balance favoring polar vs nonpolar environment prevailing therein. One interesting observation worth mentioning relates to fact that expression levels of HTT mRNA seem unaffected significantly varying little bit slightly according to tissue type indicating post translational modifications play major roles regulating stability of mutant htt transcript itself arguing again importance of posttranslational modification phenomena influencing phenotype manifestation apart simply reflecting differences in steady level of respective mRNAs expressed.
