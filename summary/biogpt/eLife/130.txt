These isoforms share an identical catalytic domain; however they have distinct functions due to differences within non-conserved regions outside the core protein sequence encoded by exons 3 through 8. JNK1 − / − mice die during embryogenesis while JNK2 deficient animals develop normally suggesting functional redundancy between different members of the MAPK family including p3 8α MAP kinases. In contrast, compound deletion of both Jnk1 alleles together with either one allele each of Mapk9 (also known as Erk2 - mouse homologue of ERK1) and Mkk7 results in embryonic lethality demonstrating essential roles for all three MAPKs downstream from MAP3K activation following stimulation via receptor tyrosine kinsases such as EGFR on ES cells derived from blastocysts lacking MKK4 expression. Thus it appears likely that there may be some degree of compensation among individual stress activated MAP3Ks leading to redundant signals converging upon common targets like ERK and SAPK pathways when any single member has been deleted individually. However we cannot exclude other possibilities since MKK7 activates additional substrates besides SAPKα / γ whereas MKK3 phosphorylates exclusively SEK1 thus allowing us to distinguish specific effects resulting directly from inhibition of MEK activity versus those arising indirectly because of compensatory responses involving alternative routes towards MEK4 phosphorylation after disruption of upstream signalling events. To address whether genetic inactivation of multiple MAPKKs would result in more severe phenotypes than simple removal of just MEK1 alone we generated double mutant embryos carrying null mutation of Mek along with targeted deletions of Map3k4 and Map4k3 loci using standard techniques described previously. Double mutants were recovered indicating no overt developmental abnormalities although further analysis will need to determine if adult tissues exhibit increased sensitivity to environmental stresses compared to wild type controls. Interestingly though, MEFs isolated form E1 0. 5 doubly homozygous embryo failed to proliferate under normal culture conditions consistent with previous observations made comparing primary fibroblasts cultured ex vivo where combined ablation of Erk1 plus ERK2 resulted in impaired cellular transformation induced by oncogenic Ras V1 2G.Therefore our studies indicate overlapping requirements amongst closely related enzymes involved in signal transduction cascades regulating fundamental processes required for mammalian physiology. It remains possible therefore that complete elimination of several key elements might lead to synthetic lethal interactions thereby providing opportunities for therapeutic intervention based approaches targeting tumours harbouring inactivating lesions affecting critical nodes controlling important biological activities associated with tumour progression rather then simply inhibiting overall levels of active enzyme per se. For example inhibitors directed against PI3K could prove useful given recent evidence implicating AKT hyperactivation secondary to PTEN dysfunction playing major causal contributions toward malignant behaviour observed in many types of sporadic prostate carcinoma.. Similarly agents designed specifically to inhibit mTOR complexes containing raptor subunits should show efficacy particularly in cases exhibiting mTORC1 hyperactivity driven primarily by Akt independent mechanisms. Finally combination therapies aimed simultaneously blocking parallel inputs into various effector arms emanating from central regulatory hubs represent attractive strategies worthy exploration especially considering emerging reports showing resistance phenomena often arise rapidly even initially responsive patients treated with drugs acting solely on target molecules themselves. Such considerations highlight the importance of understanding molecular networks operating physiologically so that appropriate drug combinations tailored appropriately according to particular disease states can be developed rationally without compromising patient safety. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > A number of investigators reported recurrent somatic alterations identified across large numbers of diverse solid malignancies employing high throughput sequencing technologies coupled with computational analyses revealing novel candidate oncogenes whose products act dominantly promoting tumorigenesis. One class of candidates includes negative regulators of RAS GTPase superfamily functioning as GAPs accelerating GTP hydrolysis rendering them inactive forms unable to interact productively with effectors mediating mitogenic response. Another group comprises putative dominant oncoproteins belonging to RHO subfamily GTPases implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization driving invasion and metastasis. Although gain-offunction point missense substitutions clustered around residues predicted to impair GAP binding appear sufficient to activate RHOB, RAC1 and CDC4 2Hs respectively causing enhanced tumorigenicity presumably reflecting constitutive engagement of shared intracellular mediators responsible for neoplastic behavior. Other examples include NF1 neurofibromatoses characterized by germline heterozygous nonsense Nf1 truncating mutations producing truncated polypeptides retaining partial functionality capable of suppressing hyperactive KRAS G1 2D -induced lung adenocarcinoma albeit less efficiently than full length wildtype product. Furthermore, conditional knockout experiments revealed haploinsufficiency being insufficient to cause neurofibromatosis implying dosage dependent suppression exerted by intact endogenous Nf1polypeptide chains expressed independently from its own promoter despite ubiquitous distribution throughout developing organs. Similar conclusions emerged recently regarding NF2 syndrome wherein biallelic Nf2 truncation causes Schwann precursor hyperplasia whilst monoallelic heterozygosity does not.This observation suggests potential involvement of modifier factors contributing significantly to phenotypic variability seen clinically depending largely on age dependant penetrance rates influenced strongly by gender bias favoring males over females who harbor approximately four times higher risk of acquiring schwannomas later in life. Nevertheless another study showed significant reduction in schwannoma incidence rate occurring spontaneously in female heterozygotes harboring hypomorphic Trp5 3 R1 6 7H variant
