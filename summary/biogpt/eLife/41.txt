 molecules such as histones or other proteins bound at sites where invading pathogens have been damaged through cellular metabolism. Our results reveal novel insights about pathogen recognition strategies used during antiviral immunity: i] One dimension can be tuned for efficient detection; ii] Nucleosomes act like obstacles preventing formation of stable complexes iii] A combination of 1D diffusion along naked nucleic acids together with 3D interactions enables rapid sensing without sacrificing specificity iv] These observations suggest new avenues toward development of synthetic sensors based upon protein scaffolds capable of discriminating among different types of ligands under physiological conditions v] In addition our study provides mechanistic explanations why some viruses escape surveillance while others do it successfully vi} How cells discriminate self versus non-self- e.g. viral genomes vs. chromosomal DNA. vii] Finally, since many diseases involve mutations leading either up- / down regulation of genes involved in autoimmune disorders or aberrant expression patterns resulting in cancer pathogenesis, understanding principles governing gene transcription may help design therapeutic approaches against disease progression. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Innate Immunity represents the first line of defence protecting organisms against microbial invasion. It relies primarily on germline encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which detect conserved structures shared amongst microbes but absent within mammalian hosts To date several families including Toll Like Receptors (TLRs), RIG I -like helicases (RLHs), NOD-like receptor family members (NLRs), AIM2-related inflammasome activators (ALFs) and C type lectin domain containing receptors (CLEC4 3 s) were shown to play important roles in detecting various classes of PAMPs present both outside and inside infected cells. d) Nucleic Acids -RNA vs DNA--Both RNAs and DNAs serve diverse functions ranging from serving structural components required for replication of genetic information across all kingdoms of life to acting as templates for synthesis of functional mRNAs and tRNAs respectively. Although there has recently emerged evidence suggesting involvement of cytosolic dsRNA species generated via reverse transcriptase activity of endogenous retroelements in triggering autoimmunity, 1 0 most studies so far focused exclusively on cytoplasmic accumulation of exogenous dsRNAs.f) Viruses use multiple tactics to evade immunosurveillance pathways involving activation of PRR's. For example poxvirus encodes decoy inhibitors specific for key players downstream TLR signalling pathway thereby avoiding induction Of note, although IFI6 was originally identified using differential display analysis comparing mRNA levels induced following IFN treatment compared to untreated controls, its role remains unclear until now. Here we report detailed biophysical characterization of recombinant full length IFI6alpha expressed recombinantly in E. coli showing high affinity binding towards short ssDNA fragments derived from plasmid pUC1 9 mimicking bacterial genome whereas no detectable interaction could observed when tested against ssRNA oligonucleotides corresponding to sequences found throughout eukaryotic genomes. g) IFI6I binds strongly to linear duplex regions formed spontaneously due to annealing complementary ssRNA1 8 strands forming circular plasmids resembling prokaryotic chromosomes thus allowing us to test whether IFI6I recognizes any form of unwound region common to both ss + ds substrates. Indeed strong association was detected indicating preferential localization near unpaired bases rather than blunt ends. h) IFI6I assembles rapidly onto free 5 'overhangs produced after partial digestion of supercoiled pUC plasmids. j) Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy imaging combined with ensemble measurements performed over extended time scales enabled direct visualization of individual IFII6s moving unidirectionally away from their initial positions followed by oligomerization events occurring only once they encounter another target site. k) Binding kinetics measured quantitatively revealed fast onrates consistent with diffusive motion coupled oligomerization. l) Oligomerization occurs preferentially around partially melted duplexes created locally by nucleosome core particles known to inhibit access of enzymes to nucleosomal targets. Taken altogether, taken together our data indicate that IFII1 forms oligomeric assemblies specifically interacting with transiently accessible gaps left behind by local melting caused mainly by spontaneous breathing motions of helical B-DNA structure. Thus, contrary to previous models proposed earlier, here we propose that cooperative action driven solely by weak electrostatic contacts does not suffice for effective discrimination between natural biopolymers despite being sufficient enough to allow highly selective responses triggered by certain stimuli. Instead instead more complex processes relying heavily on conformational changes must take place simultaneously enabling tight control over biological function. Overall, given recent advances made possible thanks to powerful experimental tools developed especially for studying dynamic systems, our work reveals previously unknown aspects regarding fundamental properties controlling signal transduction mediated by IDIFs operating beyond simple electrostatics. Moreover, because IFI1 6 plays critical regulatory roles in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, 2 7 identification of factors regulating recruitment dynamics will likely shed light on additional layers of complexity contributing significantly to fine tuning transcriptional programs activated subsequent to stimulation. Given emerging evidences implicating dysregulation of epigenetic modifications affecting chromatin architecture in numerous cancers, further investigation aimed at elucidating details concerning interplay between histone chaperones and nucleoprotein remodeling activities might lead to better understating of tumor biology. < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ < METHOD > < FREETEXT > Materials & Methods ▃ Protein Expression and Purification.
