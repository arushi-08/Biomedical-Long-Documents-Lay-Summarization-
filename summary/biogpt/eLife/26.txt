 explains why E2 enzymes cannot tolerate mutations near their active site cysteine residues without losing catalytic function [1 2 – 1 4]; our results suggest an additional mechanism for inactivating E2s: mutation may disrupt electrostatic complementarity required during formation or stabilization of functional complexes. Finally we show that inhibition can be reversed through addition of exogenous UBCH5B but not E1 alone suggesting potential therapeutic strategies against bacterial infections caused by pathogenic species such as S. flexneri. http: / / bit.ly / 2V7YJ9U. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Ubiquitin conjugation pathway, protein structure prediction, molecular dynamics simulations, post translational modification, computational biology, structural bioinformatics analysis, allosteric regulation mechanisms, innate immunity signaling pathways < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Ubiquitination plays important roles throughout eukaryotic life including cell cycle control, DNA repair processes, signal transduction cascades involved in immune responses etc.. In eukaryotes ubiquitination occurs via three sequential enzymatic steps catalyzed sequentially by activating E1s followed by transferring activated Ub onto target proteins bound either directly on E3 ligases or indirectly after transfer of first transferred UB molecule to another substrate ’ s lysine side chain forming poly ubiquitinated substrates which then undergo degradation mediated proteolysis involving proteasomes. This process involves two classes of molecules called E1 and E3s respectively responsible for activation and ligation reactions while only one class of deubiquitinating proteases known as DUBs remove them off targets thus maintaining cellular homeostasis. Although there have been many studies focusing mainly on understanding functions associated with specific components within each step separately, little attention has so far focused specifically towards investigating cross talk among different parts of the cascade especially those related to conformational changes induced upon binding events leading up to catalysis. Here using atomistic MD simulation approach combined with experimental validation based assays we investigate effects due to single point missense mutants located close enough away from any other part of the system i.e. outside the immediate vicinity of reaction center where chemical transformations take place thereby allowing us to study possible long range communication networks across entire systems like UBC domains interacting with RBR family members. These experiments were carried out initially considering wild type structures along with mutant forms obtained computationally starting from homology models built earlier experimentally determined crystal coordinates available online servers e.g. SWISS MODEL server. However later when initial modeling was done manually instead of automatically generated ones because no suitable template could currently exist even though sequence identity shared more than 5 8% similarity amongst all modeled sequences used here. Therefore final model building procedure included manual refinement cycles performed carefully following standard procedures described below. All constructed variants except Q1 6 3E variant showed similar behavior compared to WT indicating accuracy achieved despite having less number of atoms present per amino acid making use of reduced representation scheme acceptable although some minor differences observed might arise owing to lack of explicit solvent environment employed explicitly in current work. For example K1 9 9E shows slightly higher RMSD values however RMSF profiles remain almost identical implying overall stability retained whereas R1 7 6E exhibits significantly larger fluctuations particularly around loop regions resulting into increased flexibility probably arising possibly due to loss of stabilizing hydrogen bonds formed therein. Overall average backbone root mean square deviation calculated over last 5ns trajectory frames remains lower ~ 3Å hence confirming high quality nature of predicted 3D atomic positions adopted by simulated trajectories. Further detailed analyses revealed significant deviations seen mostly concentrated toward C terminal region comprising helix α6 together with loops connecting helices α5 & α7 and α8` & β4`strands depicting local perturbations introduced by various substitutions made nearby key secondary elements namely α1, α2, α3 etc. shown schematically represented above Fig 1A. Interestingly most affected sites lie very closely positioned next to conserved WKXE motif situated just before β4 strand whose importance lies well established since mutating W → A leads to complete inactivation of Uba1 homolog gene product MoeB highlighting significance played by W1 6 0A substitution studied herein too. Apart from locally affecting surrounding areas several distant locations showing large scale motions include N terminus harboring P + 1T signature element lying right under β1 sheet displaying largest positional shift reaching maximum distance till about 1 0nm apart from mutated position itself see S1 Movie File. Similar observations regarding perturbation spread beyond direct neighborhood of substituted location were reported previously wherein authors investigated effect exerted by substituting S atom adjacent to α carbon bearing K carrying Q moiety found naturally occurring in human UBE2T ortholog UbcH7. They concluded existence of strong coupling network linking functionally essential motifs spanning whole length of polypeptide chains rather than being confined solely to few short segments immediately flanking individual modules constituting actual core machinery functioning independently. It should be noted again that none of the selected deleterious nsSNPs considered involve natural occurrence elsewhere therefore they do represent artificial replacements mimicking disease causing variations identified recently in patients suffering from autoimmune disorders. To further validate predictions derived from comparative dynamic investigations conducted employing multiple independent runs initiated randomly chosen snapshots taken every nanosecond interval from respective equilibrated production phase conformations representing stable states sampled regularly until completion of equilibration period. Results presented clearly indicate presence of highly correlated movements propagated outward upwards from central β sheets encompassing major portion of UBC fold exhibiting highest degree of correlation coefficients ranging
