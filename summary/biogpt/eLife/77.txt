 protomers as well as with other receptors on cell surfaces ("bystander effect"). These results reveal fundamental differences among monomeric versus oligomeric forms of GPCR signaling complexes: whereas monomer function can largely rely solely on ligand binding events; oligomer activity requires both intra- and intermolecular communication through which signals may flow across multiple subunits simultaneously rather than sequentially along one protomer only. This study provides an important step toward understanding complex cellular responses mediated via oligomerized G protein – coupled receptors.-Gómez et al.

C metabotropic glutamate receptors has long focused on developing small molecules capable of selectively modulating their activation state without affecting basal levels of constitutive activity.3 Such compounds would not interfere directly with endogenous neurotransmitter recognition but instead act allosterically either positively or negatively relative to agonist binding.4 In contrast, most drugs acting against Class B peptide hormone family members target extracellular domains involved in natural agonist- induced activation.5 Although there remains much room for improvement regarding selectivity profiles exhibited by existing classes of therapeutic agents directed towards specific targets expressed endogenously in human tissues, it seems likely that future therapies will involve more selective approaches designed specifically around individual disease pathways.3 For example, recent studies suggest potential benefits associated with modulation of certain subtypes of Group II mGlus over others when considering treatment options aimed at treating schizophrenia symptoms.6 However, despite considerable progress made during past decades concerning our knowledge about structure — functional relationships underlying physiological functions exerted by various types of therapeutically targeted membranes.7 As we learn further details related to mechanisms controlling signal transduction pathways activated downstream of particular pharmaceutically targetable membrane proteins8 including new insights into structural features governing regulation of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide regulatory protein subunit signalsomes interacting with them, 9 significant opportunities remain open even if current strategies continue to focus almost entirely on rational design approaches.4f Indeed, although many aspects relating to development of therapeutics intended to modulate activities controlled by different families of pharmacologically tractable plasma membrane ion channels still await elucidation, substantial advances seem possible given appropriate consideration off factors influencing efficacy outcomes arising out of use of currently available drugs.1 0a It should also come as no surprise then that emerging technologies enabling high throughput screening methods offer great promise forr identification of lead candidates exhibiting desired characteristics while minimizing risks attendant thereone.4d Moreover, because some diseases arise due to malfunction of multimeric assemblies comprising several distinct components each having unique roles contributing differentially to overall biological functions1 0b additional challenges exist beyond simply identifying suitable candidate scaffolds possessing desirable pharmacokinetic properties1 0c thus requiring thoughtful selection processes prior to embarking on costly preclinical testing stages required before clinical trials commencement.8 Finally, since numerous disorders result from defects resulting from1 0d improper assembly states adopted by physiologically functioning multiprotein complexes1f, g being disrupted, perhaps attention must now turn again toconsiderations pertaining to ways whereby functionally active multimer structures might themselves serve as viable pharmaceutical targets.2 If so, however, what exactly determines whether formation of higher order quaternary arrangements contributes beneficially vs detrimentally to normal physiology andpathophysiology? To address questions raised above, particularly ones concerned with determining contributions played byheteroligomeric associations formed between
