 in protein synthesis regulation. Our study provides insights into understanding translational pausing induced mRNA decay pathways as well as bacterial stress response systems regulated via programmed -1 frameshifting or stop codon readthrough events during co-transcriptional nascent polypeptide folding process 1 0 - 2 5. The structural information also suggests that antibiotics targeting either aminoacyl transfer RNAs (tRNAs) binding sites on large subunit can be used against bacteria harboring such unique post-translocational arrested state without affecting normal cellular functions. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Ribosomes translate mRNAs using their own machinery consisting mainly of rRNAs and proteins encoded within its genome. During each round of decoding, amino acids attached onto cognate tRNAs move along the small subunits while deacylated tRNAe Met moves from E siteside towards PTC where it forms ester bonds between carboxyl group of aa residue and hydroxyl groups of A7 6 ribose moiety located inside the catalytic core of peptidyltransferase. rRNA nucleotides A2 4 8 9 and U2 5 8 5 form Watson Crick base pairs with C7 4U7 5G7 6G2 2C2 3a2 4a nucleotide triple forming part of the entrance gate of the channel leading out of the active centre We previously solved crystal structure of E. colityl pyrophosphate synthetase bound complex containing both EF-Tu • GTP & Phe-tRNAflys ternary complexes To further understand the detailed interactions among key components involved in regulating secM mediated stall event, here we report high quality single particle electron microscopy reconstructions of SecMGGQ -RNCs trapped before proline incorporation step (PRE * -C) and after complete accommodation stage (POST * -L) respectively under near physiological conditions. This work reveals important details about the conformational changes occurring upon arresting SecM action including partial unfolding of L1 stalk helix h1 5a'region around uL2 3a loop, disruption of intersubunit bridge B2a resulting in rotation movement of SSU head domain away from LSU body domains and rearrangement of A1 4e helices surrounding the CCA ends of A-, P-, E-, D-type tRNAs causing them to adopt distorted conformations incompatible with efficient catalysis. Furthermore our data suggest that although the overall conformation of SecM1 0QG remains similar compared to those observed earlier, there exist subtle differences especially regarding H1 5b "linker regions" connecting N terminus of SecM2 1QGQ2 4Q mutant to P1 0C motif responsible for inducing strong arrests. Taken together, all above observations lead us conclude that besides blocking forward progression of elongating chain beyond Pro codons, SecMs induce additional defects like steric hindrance preventing proper positioning of substrate tRNAs required for effective transpeptidation reaction thereby inhibiting subsequent rounds of addition reactions thus providing more time window allowing slow but continuous production of polypeptides until they reach functional states. Thus, based on our current knowledge, SecMs act primarily as kinetic inhibitors rather than strict terminators of downstream processes. Finally, comparison analysis shows striking similarity between the termination efficiency triggered by SecM sequences carrying mutations introduced outside conserved motifs suggesting existence of multiple redundant elements controlling release factor activity. Overall, our combined biochemical experiments coupled with recent advances made possible by cryoET have provided new mechanistic insight into how SecM induces transient stalls prior to processive polyprolines additions. It will help better understands fundamental aspects related to codonrecognition specificity of RFs and may aid future development strategies aimed toward developing novel antimicrobial agents capable of disrupting essential biological activities associated with specific stages of protein biosynthesis. < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ < METHOD > < FREETEXT > Methods ▃ Preparation of pretranslocated Sec recom binant particles (PRESC) Complex was formed following published protocol Crystallization trials were performed manually sitting drop vapor diffusion method mixing equal volumes of sample solution mixed with reservoir solutions followed incubation over reservoirs equilibrated overnight at room temperature. Crystals appeared typically within few days when drops contained ~ 1 mg ml − 1 of purified samples suspended in buffer composed of Tris pH = 7. 5, Mg acetate 1mM, K glutamate 5mM, spermine tetrahydrochloride 2mM, PEG 8K 8kDa. For heavy atom derivatization crystals grown up till day three were soaked directly in mother liquor supplemented with sodium iodide ions ranging concentration range from1 0mM to1M added slowly every hour keeping soaking period constant. Soaked crystals grew normally except only minor improvement could been achieved even though iodine atoms diffused throughout entire volume of crystallization droplet indicating no significant radiation damage effect caused by soak procedure itself. Diffraction datasets collected initially failed because diffraction spots showed severe anisotropy likely arising mostly from non isomorphism amongst various lattices generated stochastically during nucleation phase. Therefore optimized dataset has been obtained by merging several individual reflections belonging to same lattice having very low mosaicity values close to unity hence reducing effects coming largely from anisotropic diffractions.
