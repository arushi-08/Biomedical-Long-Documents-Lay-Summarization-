 chaperones: they should be able to bind unfolded polypeptides but not folded structures because folding requires energy input from ATP hydrolysis or other sources; however we show here that ribosome binding can also reduce FP dynamics through steric hindrance effects without requiring any additional energetic cost for chaperone function. In addition our results suggest an explanation why some bacterial species have more positively charged ribosomal surfaces compared to others despite having fewer negatively charged auxiliary factors required during translation elongation [1 – 3]. Finally it was recently reported that salt concentration affects both structure formation kinetics and stability of RNA molecules at low concentrations while increasing unfolding rates above physiological conditions suggesting that salts affect all aspects related to nucleic acid structural transitions including local flexibility / rigidity changes associated with conformational switching events such as those observed between A - B form DNA transition under tension force microscopy experiments. Our study suggests similar mechanisms behind salt- induced modulation of macromolecular motions within cells where ions play important roles affecting interactions among macromolecules via direct ion pairing forces acting along specific pathways rather then simply altering solvent viscosity. These observations open new perspectives towards understanding cellular functions involving complex biomolecular networks whose dynamic behavior cannot yet fully understood using current experimental techniques alone. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Proteins perform most biological activities inside living organisms performing tasks ranging from catalysis To understand intracellular biochemistry one needs information about macromolecule conformations sampled throughout time scales spanning milliseconds down to picoseconds Here I present data showing that different types of globular domains exhibit distinct mobilities depending upon whether there exists either repulsive Coulomb potentials around them or attractive van der Waals contacts formed when two oppositely signed charges repel each other.Figs. Fig 1A shows typical examples of amino acids found in various classes of soluble globular domain sequences based on hydrophobicity scale developed earlier By comparing Figs 1B & 1C, it appears clear that only hydrophobic residues tend to interact directly whereas hydrophilic side chains do so indirectly forming hydrogen bonds leading eventually to water mediated attractions.Fig. 1D illustrates possible scenarios explaining differences seen experimentally between "sticky" and "non stickier" groups discussed below. For example, if attraction occurs mainly near the N terminus, resulting in faster movement away from the center region of mass relative to C terminal regions, see Fig 1E, F, G, H top panels, respectively. On the contrary, repulsion leads to slow movements toward the central core causing overall lower average diffusivities (i.e. higher apparent viscosities) -See bottom panel ofFig.1F and1G indicating larger values obtained for sticky groupscf. Table S1 † for details regarding statistical analysis performed. Similar trends were previously described theoretically Based on previous studies It has been suggested that electrostatics plays major role in determining global cell morphology and size However, since many biomolecules undergo large amplitude internal rearrangements coupled with small displacements occurring mostly outside the immediate vicinity of biomolecule's boundaries, e.g. long range correlated fluctuations, entropic contributions arising primarily from chain entropy must necessarily contribute significantly to measured diffusivity values.Fig. 2 presents model systems illustrating potential ways whereby multivalent cations could alter polymer conformation thereby modulating biopolymer motion.The first system consists of poly glutamic acidb polyarginine block copolymers synthesized by Dr. Karim Raab et al.. As expected, high affinity polycations lead to strong reduction in polypeptide backbone relaxation times consistent with increased hydrodynamic radii (Rh = 4 nm vs. 6 5 Å corresponding tof PGA homopolymer vs copolymer respectivelyfig 2A left column graph). Interestingly, even though polymers containing short blocks of cationic segments exhibited reduced segmental relaxations, no significant change in mean squared displacement 〈 r ^ 〉 occured implying unchanged bulk solution friction coefficient γ * ≈ η * γR ¯ T ~ 2πηRT − 1 regardless of cation length n. Thus, unlike what would occur following simple Coulombic repulsions, polyelectrolyte complexes appear insensitive to counterion valency variations likely owing to effective screened counterions' volume fraction being close to unity. Such behaviour might explain recent observation made by Dudowicz etal. who showed negligible difference in α value calculated assuming Debye regime approximation versus considering full Poisson Boltzmann theory Although the second case involves neutral linear polyethylene glycol (PEG) oligomers functionalized with carboxylic moieties attached onto pendant amine functional group s + located randomly distributed across molecule lengthstood out clearly exhibiting much smaller increase in Rh after adding divalent Mg 2 + counter ionfigure2B right columns compare Rg app values before and after metal complexation. Note again very little variation in ⟨ r ̂ ⟩ although slight increases in 〈 r ̂ 〉 indicate slightly enhanced self association propensity of PEGs bearing longer spacers connecting carboxylate functionalities. Since monovalent Na + does not induce aggregation, the latter result indicates weak interparticle correlations presumably originating from dipole coupling effectf.Fig2. iii) Neutral diaminoalkanes functionalised with alkyl tails varying in number nc ∈ {8 …} 7 9 a.u. were investigated next. While keeping constant total ligand density ξ fixed, changing spacer lengths led us observe systematic decreases inτM reflecting decreased segment stiffness (i.e. softening) followed bygradual stiffening once ligands become sufficiently spaced apart (i.e.beyond nearest neighbor distance d NN ∼ 5
