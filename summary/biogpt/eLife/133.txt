 for tuning functional characteristics by altering VSD stability during transitions between active / inactive conformations. Our results suggest that structural differences among homologous proteins can be exploited as an effective strategy toward engineering novel protein function through modulation of conformational dynamics rather than static three dimensional structure.DOI: http: / / dx.doi.org / 1 0. 7 5 5 4 / eLife.0 2 3 8 9. 0 0 6. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
