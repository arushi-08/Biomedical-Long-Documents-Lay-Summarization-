 mutations on both open probability and conductance; they alter equilibrium constants for transitions from an inward facing conformation through intermediate states toward outward or occluded ones at low [Cl −] o. Our results suggest mechanisms whereby disease causing missense substitutions could disrupt normal function via altered conformational equilibria rather than direct perturbation of functional groups involved directly in catalysis or ligand interactions. They further indicate why some variants can be rescued pharmacologically while others cannot because their impact is indirect – altering protein dynamics indirectly affects energetics required for proper functioning. These insights will help guide future drug design efforts targeting allosteric sites where pathogenic amino acid changes might affect dynamic properties critical for therapeutic rescue as well as other aspects such as folding efficiency. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Cystic Fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) belongs among ABC transporters whose members couple vectorial transport cycles driven by adenosine triphosphate (MgATP) consumption 1 0 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 To date more than 3 0 0 0 different sequence variations have been identified throughout human populations Genetic variation has important implications regarding clinical outcome For example, ~ 1% of people carry one copy each of nonsense alleles G5 5 1D and R1 1 7H, resulting respectively in severe pancreatic insufficiency and mild pulmonary dysfunction Most known loss-of-function defects result either in misfolded proteins unable to reach cell surface membranes Because most genetic alterations lead to misfolding errors, there exists no simple relationship linking genotype to phenotype However, several studies showed correlation between severity of lung pathology caused by ΔF5 0 8CFTR mutation and residual activity measured using patch clamp techniques Single molecule experiments revealed distinct kinetic signatures associated with various classes of defective mutant A recent study reported similar observations about long lived substate events observed during closing bursts Of note here was our finding That many non-synonymous SNPs were found within regions showing strong cross correlations Among all possible pairs tested, those involving positions located closer together tended to exhibit stronger couplings suggesting tighter packing around them Figure Interestingly, when considering residue conservation scores based upon multiple alignments obtained independently Using Eq. S1 below, we find that if any given pair had higher value then its corresponding position would tend towards being less conserved Overall, however, since high values do not necessarily imply tight contacts, caution should always be exercised before assigning significance levels to pairwise energy differences calculated according Eqs S2 & S3 above. It remains unknown whether individual inter-domain interfaces contribute equally strongly to overall free energies of stabilization of specific structures. As noted previously By contrast, intra-subunit networks exhibited weaker interatomic distances compared to interdomain ones indicating looser contact patterns Although detailed information concerning local structure surrounding particular side chains varies depending on experimental conditions used, e.g. temperature, ionic strength etc. Thus far few crystal structures exist for full length eukaryotic membrane bound ion pumps including SERCA Despite significant progress made over decades studying large scale rearrangements accompanying substrate translocation cycle in bacterial homologs, understanding mechanistic details governing anion permeation pathways in mammalian homologues like CFTR remain elusive. Recently published cryo electron microscopy maps of mouse CFTR captured three major configurations representing outwardingsideinward- Inward facing And fully opened Forms While previous work suggested that NBD1 undergoes substantial movement relative to NBD2 During activation transition, cytoplasmic gate becomes wider due primarily to rotation of TM6 away from TM4 thus widening access pathway to extracellular solution Another interesting observation drawn out earlier Based on homology modeling and MD simulations performed under physiological salt concentrations, Cheng et al proposed that intracellular vestibule contains four positively charged arginine clusters formed mainly by R3 3 4W, R5 5 5K, R7 5Q, R9 0W and R2 9K All data presented so farpoint clearly against existence of stable asymmetric forms of WT apo-CFTR Under saturating concentration of nucleotides, i.e. presence of Mg + ions, ADP alone does not induce detectable asymmetry whereas AMP-PNP induces partial symmetry breaking characterized by narrowing down of inner half site cavity near R region. Such effect appears largely reversible after removal of ligands Since symmetric form represents energetically favored ground state configuration, absence of apparent difference suggests lack of stabilizing forces favoring formation of symmetrical conformer. Indeed, although AMP-PCP binds tightly inside TMD cavities, presumably mimicking post hydrolytic product complex, subsequent release requires additional force generated by mechanical strain imposed by TMDs Upon addition of AMPPNP into pre equilibrated system containing preformed asymmetrical conformers, rapid conversion back to original distribution occurs immediately followed by slow relaxation process reflecting equilibration time constant ≈ τ = ∼ 1min At present limited resolution power available in current recording technique, precise kinetics describing interconversion rates between metastable intermediates along reaction coordinate leading up to final steady state condition still needs clarification. Nevertheless, comparison of rate coefficients derived therefromfort nonequilibrium ensemble average distributions provides useful insight into nature of microscopic processes taking place during early stages of interaction between substrates and receptors < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃ ▃
