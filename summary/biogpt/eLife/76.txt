One example where computational models were developed based on experimental data involves face recognition memory formation. Face learning experiments revealed two stages involving sequential synaptic plasticity events occurring over several days after training. During early stage consolidation processes lasting up to one day post acquisition, synapses undergo long term potentiation whereas those undergoing late phase changes last longer than three weeks Post completion of initial experience all memories become stable representations through stabilization of new connections. This process requires both local interactions among existing networks To understand whether similar principles apply throughout cortex it will therefore first need detailed knowledge concerning basic properties governing signal transmission dynamics operating under natural conditions. For instance, what determines which pathway should transmit particular incoming spikes given its intrinsic variability inherent to spike generation? How does firing rate relate to temporal precision when transmitting precise timing patterns encoded using spiking responses compared with more conventional amplitude modulation codes? What role do dendritic filtering effects play if they occur simultaneously with axonal propagation delays? Do dendrites contribute significantly to shaping postsynaptic potentials generated locally near soma but also propagate back onto distal regions of dendrite? Can axons effectively convey temporally coded messages without significant loss due to conduction delay imposed upon them by cable length constraints placed around axon hillock region? Are there any fundamental limitations preventing efficient use of time domain representation schemes like pulse trains vs. frequency modulated tones employed widely in neuroscience studies today? Addressing some questions related to signaling reliability can help us better interpret results obtained experimentally since reliable detection depends not only on sensitivity towards certain parameters but importantly also on response stability following repeated stimulation trials. Thus far most neurophysiological investigations focused primarily on measuring average performance metrics including mean firing rates and trial variance measures associated with various physiological variables such as membrane potential fluctuations, action potential waveforms, etc. rather ignoring possible sources contributing noise leading to unreliable measurements. However recent work suggests that single neuron behavior varies considerably depending on history dependence arising either because individual neurons receive variable amounts of excitatory drive resulting in varying degrees of adaptation or owing to stochastic variations introduced by imperfect intracellular machinery involved in generating electrical impulses. Such phenomena could potentially lead to erroneous conclusions being drawn assuming constant responsiveness despite changing internal state of network elements. Furthermore, previous theoretical works suggest that increasing number of presynaptic fibers innervating target neurons leads to increased probability of failure especially so close enough together that failures result in no output Signal transfer efficiency describes how well transmitted energy per unit volume decreases relative to ideal case wherein transmitter release occurs instantaneously regardless of distance traveled By analyzing spontaneous subthreshold activities recorded extracellularly before evoked discharges occurred, here we investigate functional connectivity amongst principal projection neurons forming major components of mouse primary somatosensory barrel cortices receiving convergent peripheral tactile afferents originating mainly from mystacial vibrissae follicles located above corresponding contralateral whiskers. Using simultaneous extracellular recordings made directly below layer IV barrels representing activated whisker pad areas, we characterize characteristics pertaining to afferent fiber recruitment probabilities and compare resultant population behaviors against predictions derived theoretically considering known anatomical structure and biophysical attributes of thalamocortical projections. Our analysis reveals strong correlations suggesting convergence exists predominantly though non-random manner implying existence of functionally connected populations whose collective outputs exhibit enhanced correlation structures reflecting shared receptive field profiles. Further investigation shows evidence supporting differential roles played by putative feedforward versus feedback loops comprising reciprocal dendrodendritically mediated recurrent excitation and feed forward disinhibition respectively. Finally, simulations demonstrate robustness exhibited by proposed model architectures allowing faithful decoding of behaviorally meaningful spatiotemporal sequences embedded inside noisy background noises encountered naturally in vivo. Taken altogether, present study provides novel insights relating structural organization of intracortical microcircuitries to emergent dynamical functions observed physiologically thereby providing valuable clues necessary for developing realistic mathematical frameworks describing computation carried out therein. It further highlights importance of studying dynamic nature of cellular assemblies beyond simple static descriptions commonly adopted currently in literature thus enabling development of improved predictive modeling approaches capable of capturing essential details pertinent to real world situations. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ ▃ < RESULT > < FREETEXT > Results ▃ Spontaneous Activity Patterns Underlying Sensory Processing.
