 strains were isolated using our microfluidic platform combined with an automated image analysis pipeline as well as traditional culture techniques such as streak plating or dilution series on solid media plates followed by identification via 1 6S rRNA gene sequencing. The presented approach enables rapid discovery processes without compromising time efficiency compared to existing approaches like microtiter assays but at much lower costs per sample due to reduced material consumption during culturing steps. This study demonstrates proof concept feasibility towards future applications where miniaturized microbiology can be used not only for basic science purposes e.g. drug development studies but also applied industrially including bioenergy production through fermentation technologies. ▃ Broader Context • Microbial cultures represent one important source for novel bioactive molecules; however their application has been hampered so far because they cannot easily access most microbes present within natural environments. Conventional liquid handling systems suffer either from slow growth rates resulting into long incubation times required before significant amounts of biomass accumulate or lack sufficient resolution allowing precise control over cell numbers / volumes needed for subsequent analyses. In contrast, microfluidics offers fast processing speeds enabling parallel cultivations under controlled conditions thus reducing experimental variability caused by differences between individual experiments performed manually. However, current microdevices still require further optimization regarding automation strategies and data management tools. To overcome limitations associated with currently available platforms, here we developed a new device combining both aspects: increased throughputs together with improved detection capabilities leading us to isolate more diverse organisms previously unknown even after extensive efforts involving classical laboratory procedures. Our method allows direct coupling of microbioreactors containing thousands of droplets hosting hundreds up to several thousand micro colonies thereby providing unprecedented opportunities for efficient sampling regimes. These developments will enable researchers working across different disciplines ranging from environmental sciences to biotechnology to accelerate discoveries about microbe ⁻ environment interactions and biotechnological potential especially when considering emerging antibiotic resistant pathogens. ▃ Conclusion & outlook ▃ Microfluidic technology provides powerful solutions toward accelerating fundamental knowledge generation concerning complex ecological phenomena underlying ecosystem functioning and human health related issues alike. It opens exciting perspectives beyond pure academic pursuits aiming at developing innovative diagnostic concepts complementing established analytical workflows already being implemented today. Furthermore it may serve industrial needs requiring large scale manufacturing capacities equipped with advanced robotic equipment capable of performing multiple operations simultaneously. Finally, integrated multi-functional lab chips could help bridging gaps among fields spanning biology, chemistry, physics, engineering etc … Thus, integrating all mentioned areas would open possibilities for interdisciplinary collaborations addressing challenges arising out of societal concerns around sustainable resource use instead of focusing solely upon technological advances alone. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
