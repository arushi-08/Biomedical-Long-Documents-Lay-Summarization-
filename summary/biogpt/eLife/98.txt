 vectors for delivery of nucleic acids into plants; they can be used as carriers not only DNA but also siRNAs / miRNAs targeting genes involved in disease resistance mechanisms against other diseases such asXanthomonas campestris pathovar vesicatoria causing bacterial spot on tomato crops [1 0 2 •]. This work provides structural insights useful both for understanding fundamental aspects of infection by flexible filaments like those found among eukaryotes including humans, animals and fungi, and providing information about potential applications involving them. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > atomic model building, cryo EM reconstruction, Helical assembly mechanism, nucleoprotein filament formation, non-segmented negative strand RNA genome packaging strategy, X-ray crystallography refinement pipeline < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Research organism: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Virus < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Viruses infect all living things except bacteria using an array of proteins called capsid subunits assembled around genetic material inside tiny structures known as capsids. Capsids protect the genomic materials before infecting cells so it ’ s essential if we want new treatments based upon interfering RNAs — molecules made up entirely out of ribonucleic acid packaged within virions. However our knowledge regarding what makes different types of virion stable enough remains limited because there have been few high quality images available showing details of individual components interacting together during replication cycles. Here, Khan et al. use modern microscopy techniques combined with computational methods to reveal detailed pictures of one type of human pathogen named pepper mottle virus when replicating itself inside fruit trees growing under field conditions. These experiments show why some parts of the capsidsubunit interact more strongly than others making sure each part has specific roles depending on where along the way the process takes place. In addition, knowing exactly who interacts could help us design drugs able to block certain steps without affecting normal cell processes elsewhere. For example, blocking just two key regions would stop most infections occurring while leaving healthy tissues unaffected. Further studies will now need to investigate whether similar strategies apply across species too wide ranging from insects through mammals down to single celled organisms. Finally, since many animal pathogenic agents carry double stranded genomes instead of positive sense ones, future efforts should focus on determining three dimensional models describing how host factors recognize particular sequences present throughout the entire length of any given particle rather then focusing solely on identifying contacts formed amongst amino acids located near either ends of capsomers. Such approaches may lead researchers closer towards developing novel antiviral therapies capable of preventing spread of deadly infectious threats worldwide. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Plant viruses belonging toPotyviridaefamilies Totitidae andTombusviradesfamaines Carladiviafamiliae replicate themselves via complementary strands synthesized de novo after entering infected hosts' cytoplasm followed bytranscription ofminus stranslated messenger RNAleading inultimately to production of plus strand progeny carrying full complement of genomicsegments encoding necessary functions required for successful completion of life cycle.They form icosahedral shells composed primarily offamily members having T = 3symmetry consisting ontentimes of 6 0meric units arranged radially surrounding 5 0nm diameter cylindrical channels running parallel withencapsidated dsRNA segment forming icosahedrons ~ 4 5nm long × 7 6nmouter diagonally.The major component of spherical cowpea chlorotic mottled crinklingovirus was shown recently to consist oflexamer rings stacked atop pentameric pentamersencircling circular dsDNA molecule representing closed ring architecture isodensity packing arrangement characteristic fords orisometric particles.While numerous crystal structureswere determined over recent years revealing molecular basis underlying various biological properties exhibited by diverse groups of plant viruses, relatively little attention had focused lately on elucidating higher order organization inherent betweentudies associated with complex macromolecular complexes containing multiple componenets organized differently relative to simple globular proteins.To address this issue, we chose pepo mosaichordeiosisvirus (PMH) -another member fromTobraviroidae family- whose morphology closely resemble those observed previously described for tombusviruses although being much larger due to presence of additional satellite moleculesin vivo. It contains linear ssDNA covalently linked to five identical CPs comprising 8 1kDa polypeptide chains folded similarly to tobamoviral CPs3 featuring N & O domains separated by hinge region flanked by N- and C- termini domains4 enveloping inner surface of tubular shell measuring approximately 8nm6 surrounded by thin layer of amorphous material.7 As expected thusPMHforms quasi-continuous tubes whereas TMV assembles into discrete rods owing to differences in size and shape of respective core domain despite sharing common ancestor origin. Despite significant sequence similarity shared amongTMVCps, subtle variations exist resulting in distinctive features distinguishing theTMV class from otherss negativessRNAs.8 Although no 3D image data exists yet for PMHV
