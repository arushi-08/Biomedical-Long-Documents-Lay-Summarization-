 protein but neither with phospho-mimicking nor non phosphorylatable versions thereof indicating that phosphorylation switches off an essential regulatory mechanism during nutrient deprivation stress adaptation (Figure 8). Our results suggest that plant cells have evolved specific mechanisms allowing them to fine tune their transcriptome under fluctuating nutritional status without compromising on survival rates or fitness costs associated therewith.We propose here one such strategy involving post translational modification via reversible serine 1 7 4 -threonine 2 0 6 double phosphosite switch within the basic leucine zipper domain regulating DNA binding specificity through conformational changes upon activation state change induced by upstream signaling events like sugar sensing pathway mediated by SnRK1s [5 9]. This mode of regulation has been described before e.g. for mammalian c-Jun where multisite phosphorylations lead to altered dimer formation resulting into differential promoter occupancy depending on cellular environment [6 0 – 6 2]. In addition it was shown recently also for human ATF4 suggesting similar principles might apply more broadly across eukaryotes including higher land plants although further studies will need to address whether other members from group C can undergo analogous modifications leading to functional diversification among family members.It remains unclear if additional posttranslational modifications besides S1 7 4T2 0 6N may occur since our MS analysis did identify several phosphopeptides containing both sites simultaneously albeit less frequently than single site peptides supporting previous observations made previously using synthetic peptide substrates showing enhanced efficiency when multiple phosphoacceptor residues were present close together [6 3].The identification of novel targets downstream of SNF1 suggests new avenues towards understanding complex biological processes involved in carbon source utilization especially considering recent advances regarding roles played by alternative splicing variants generated after initiation codon selection between ATG codons located either side of exon junction sequences [6 4].This study provides evidence linking glucose homeostasis directly to amino acid biosynthesis pathways providing insight about possible molecular links connecting carbohydrate availability and nitrogen assimilation required for optimal cell proliferation rate observed already decades ago [6 5]. Furthermore, given the central role assigned so far mainly to glycolysis intermediates derived from sucrose breakdown rather then starch synthesis products, future work should focus now onto elucidating potential cross talk points integrating information concerning metabolite flux distribution throughout glycolytic branches toward storage compounds accumulation versus biomass production respectively. Finally, while most current knowledge relates primarily to heterotrophic tissues grown ex planta, growing evidences point increasingly to important functions performed specifically in autotrophic organs pointing even closer ties existing beyond simple substrate competition models currently used to explain photosynthesis driven respiration dynamics [6 6]. Thus, unraveling detailed mechanistic details underlying integration of light signals along photosynthetic electron transport chain components would help understand why some mutants affected in chloroplast biogenesis exhibit impaired photorespiratory defects whereas others do not- something likely linked to differences found earlier based solely on transcript profiling data obtained mostly from leaves exposed to high CO2 concentrations [6 7]. Such insights gained herein shall contribute significantly to improving crop productivity strategies aiming at maximizing yield per unit area cultivated soil available resources thus reducing dependency on fossil fuels consumption over time. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All experiments presented below conform strictly to institutional guidelines set forth by Max Planck Society for Experimental Biology Institutional Review Board; permit number TVV  P-0 5-1 8A2.
