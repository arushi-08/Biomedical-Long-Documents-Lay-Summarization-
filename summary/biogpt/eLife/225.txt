 cycles (e.g. diurnal or seasonal).IMPORTANCE Circadian clocks allow organisms from all kingdoms of life to anticipate daily changes such as sunlight intensity fluctuations over 2 4 h by regulating gene expression patterns accordingly. In addition to temporal control of metabolic processes within individual cell types, clock outputs can also coordinate cellular physiology across tissues through systemic signaling networks involving hormones like melatonin which act via G protein coupled receptors expressed throughout animals' bodies. Here we show evidence suggesting that one key function of cyanobacterial rhythms may be coordination between different organs under natural lighting regimes where multiple environmental cues combine together into complex signals whose interpretation requires integration among various organ systems including those controlling photosynthesis. This study provides insight about potential roles played by rhythmic transcriptional regulation mediated directly downstream of core oscillator components in coordinating organismal responses to fluctuating environments. These results have implications beyond biology: they suggest new approaches towards engineering synthetic circuits capable of responding appropriately both spatially and temporarily according to changing environment parameters. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
