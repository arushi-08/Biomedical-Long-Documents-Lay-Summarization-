 transport by myosin motors toward nuclear envelope where spec2 / BSM proteins localize on ER membranes surrounding plastids as well as around nucleus via their interaction with kinesin motor protein KCBP [Formula: see text] -interacting kinesins 1 9 0 kDa polypeptide at plasmodesmata sites. Spectrains could also play roles similar those proposed here but further studies will be needed before we can draw any conclusions about them because our data do suggest some degree of functional redundancy among different isoforms within each class. The significance statement This article describes new functions associated with dynamic tubules extending out from plant cell organelles known collectively as stroma containing bodies - stromal domains derived form thylakoid membrane stacks found inside leaf mesophyll cells.These structures were first described over 6 5 years ago when electron microscopy revealed long filamentous projections emanating off thylakoids into cytoplasm; however little progress has occurred regarding understanding what role such fibers might serve due largely to lack of genetic tools available until now.Here I describe two types of cytoskeletal elements involved in regulating formation and maintenance of one type of stromal domain termed "stromules' using Arabidopsis thaliana mutants defective either microtubule organizing center activity or F-Actin polymerization combined with chemical inhibition experiments.. My goal throughout my presentation is to highlight novel insights gained through studying specific components important for cytoskeleton regulation while still maintaining overall cellular homeostasis under normal growth conditions. http: / / dx.doi.org / 1 0. 7 8 3 4 8ki.2. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
