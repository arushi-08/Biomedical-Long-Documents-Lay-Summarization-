 step through an epigenetic mechanism involving DNA methylation / demethylation processes. These results suggest new roles for both neat1as transcripts and other RNAs with repetitive elements such as transposable element derived ones during development or cellular differentiation where cell cycle progression could be regulated according to environmental cues via clock genes like Bmal1 which also display cyclic expressions patterns [2 0 – 2 4]. The fact that many different types of mRNAs can accumulate within them suggests possible additional functions beyond those already described but still remains elusive since most studies have been performed on reporter constructs lacking endogenous regulatory regions. Our data show however some interesting similarities between our system using natural target sequence inserted into the 3'UTR region compared to previous reports showing accumulation of artificial targets inside perinucleolar caps after transfection of plasmids expressing either tandemly repeated copies of the same repeat unit from human α satellite centromeric heterochromatin or tandem arrays composed of short interspersed nucleotide retroposons SINE B1 associated with mouse embryonic stem cells pluripotency state maintenance. It would therefore appear likely that any transcript bearing multiple cis acting sites able to bind specific RBPs will localize specifically near its site of transcription due to interactions among trans factors bound nearby allowing local concentration effects without requiring direct interaction with each others partners. Such mechanisms may allow fine tuning regulation depending upon physiological conditions rather than being restricted just to certain tissues while maintaining robustness against genetic variations thus ensuring proper functioning under various circumstances. Further work should now focus more precisely onto understanding whether similar molecular pathways exist outside brain tissue although it appears clear here again that paraspeckle formation plays important functional consequences regarding temporal organization of genome activity especially concerning key developmental events occurring throughout life course e.g. neurogenesis... We believe that future investigations aimed towards better characterizing spatio-temporally controlled transcriptome dynamics might help us understand why so few organisms survive today despite having evolved complex genomes whose complexity has increased dramatically over evolutionary times … < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All animal experiments complied strictly following European guidelines 8 6 / 6 0EEC directive and French legislation Laws n ° 9 7 / 5 4 8EC dated March 4th, 1 9 th, 1 9 9 7.They received approval number CEEA : B 7 5-0 5VIC du Comité d'Ethique en Expérimentation Animale de la Règional Languedoc Roussillay - Centre National pur Est et Ministère Français des Affaires Études sur l 'Utilisation Normale Gent; authorization numbers C7 5-0 6MVT and B7 5- {"type": "entrez-nucleotide", "attrs": {"text": "A7 5-A0 0 2 1 2", "term _ id": "4 7 0 8 6 2 9"}} A7 5-A0 0 2 1 2.Mice used in this project correspond respectively to C5 7BL / 6J mice obtained directly from Charles River Laboratories France (L ′ Arbresle Cedex, F Vernier Saint Germe Chesnes, France) and NMRI outbred strain purchased locally. Animals were housed individually until sacrifice except for behavioral analysis carried out blindly before starting light phase recordings. For behavior experiment animals were kept together one per cage up till day two then separated afterwards if necessary based on genotype information provided later. Light cycles consisted of alternating periods of darkness followed by exposure to white fluorescent lights emitting diodes set off at ZT0 = dawn + 1h, ZT1 2noon − 2h, ZT2 4midnight ± 4h etc.. Zebrabox software (Viewpoint Life Sciences Inc. Lyonne Village, Switzerland) allowed recording every minute of locomotor activities recorded separately for males and females. At least three independent cohorts consisting of five wild type littermates and six mutant siblings aged eight weeks old were analyzed simultaneously. Behavioral analyses started once daily beginning at mid dark period i.e. corresponding to zeigenthal Time zero (ZT6) and ending immediately prior to onset of active phases defined herein as “subjective dusk ” (ZT4).The first cohort included seven WT female subjects sacrificed 3h apart along the entire LD cycle (ZT3, -6, -9, -1 2, -2 h relative to CTmax) and nine KO littermate controls euthanized 6h apart across the whole photoperiod (ZT8, -3, -7, -0. 5h relative to CT maximum). A second group comprised ten WT male subject killed 8h apart spanning the full photocycle (CT1 3h--1 9h1 0h vs. CT2 4h2 0min vs CTT5, -8, -1 5min versus CTT7, -5 min). Finally another third population comprising eleven mutants plus twelve sex matched wildtype individuals underwent continuous monitoring of wheel running behaviors conducted blind to genotypes. Wheel revolutions measured automatically every hour served thereafter as surrogate marker reflecting general locomotion levels.
