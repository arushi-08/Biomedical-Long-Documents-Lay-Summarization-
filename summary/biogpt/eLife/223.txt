 protein expression including p (S9) -GSK 3β Y2 1 6p, total c-Myc levels as well as nuclear localization of active form of β-catenin.These results suggest potential utility of targeting both kinases simultaneously or downstream effectors such as GSK3 kinase activity may be more efficacious than inhibiting upstream components like Frizzled receptors which have been shown not only ineffective against advanced cancers due to their high redundancy among family members 2 7 – 3 0] yet still capable of suppressing early stage tumors when used alone 4 5, 4 8.. The fact that pharmacological blockade of either Src [Dasatinib treatment has also demonstrated efficacy at reducing tumor burden without causing significant toxicity during clinical trials on patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)} nor Abl tyrosine kinse inhibitor Imatinib mesylate did show any effect suggests specificity between different classes of small molecule drugs targeted towards specific families of proteins involved in oncogenic pathways. Our data support further investigation using selective dual SFK blockers together with other agents aimed toward blocking multiple nodes within one single network is warranted given recent evidence suggesting synergistic effects can occur upon simultaneous suppression of two distinct networks converging onto common targets 9, 4 9. In addition our work provides mechanistic insight regarding why some colon carcinomas do respond better to anti-EGFR therapy while others fail despite having wild type KRAS status indicating combination therapies involving dasatinib should perhaps include those directed specifically against mutant RAS driven malignancies where resistance mechanisms remain poorly understood. Finally it will important now determine whether similar regulatory mechanism exists beyond APC mutations since activating mutation of CTNNB1 itself occurs frequently across many types of solid neoplasms making up over half all cases diagnosed each year worldwide. It would thus appear likely that strategies designed around modulating aberrant RTK mediated PI3K / AKT activities through combined treatments incorporating SRC TKIs might prove beneficial even if they target cells harboring wildtype Ras alleles thereby circumventing possible compensatory feedback loops associated with direct MEK inhibitions.While additional studies need to address several key questions raised here before moving forward therapeutically exploiting SFKs ’ ability to regulate canonical WNT signals there appears sufficient rationale exist based on what already known about CRC biology so far to justify pursuing future investigations focused directly addressing them. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All animal experiments were approved under protocol  {"type": "entrez-nucleotide", "attrs": {"text": "A1 1 0 0 7", "term _ id": "4 9 2 3 9 7", "term _ text": "gb | ia1 1 0 0 7y"}} A1 1 0 0 7- “Targeting Focal Adhesion Kinases ” by IACUC committee at University Health Network Research Ethics Board Toronto ON Canada. Mice carrying heterozygous germline Apc Min allele generated via homologous recombination resulting in truncation after codon 8 5 0 leading to constitutive stabilization of truncated adenomatous polyposis coli product (ΔN8 5ac) expressed exclusively throughout mouse intestine epithelium were obtained originally from Dr. Bert Vogelstein's laboratory (Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions School of Medicine Baltimore MD USA).

For xenograft experiment female athymic nude Foxn1 nu strain Nu / J purchased from Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME USA maintained according to institutional guidelines. Animals received humane care following recommendations outlined in Guide for Care and Use of Experimental Animal Resources Commission Recommendation No. 8.The age range utilized herein ranged from six weeks old till twelve months depending on experimental design. No randomization method employed because animals had no prior knowledge concerning genotype identity except gender assignment performed blind whenever feasible. Sample size estimation required considering statistical power analysis taking account inter individual variability observed experimentally i.e. number of polyps per group varied significantly ranging from few dozen lesions detected macroscopically in young adult male cohorts aged less then three month versus thousands seen microscopically in older females cohort aged nine months.1 0 mg kg − 1 body weight dose level chosen being equivalent to- lower doses reported elsewhere 5 0ml Kg − 1 volume administered intraperitoneally every day until sacrifice unless otherwise stated. Tumor growth rate calculated daily assuming exponential increase model. At least five independent biological replicates comprising ten randomly selected individuals representing four genotypes namely WT littermates control treated vehicle n = 5 & untreated n = 5 vs. KO controls receiving same dosage regimen plus drug n = 5 & untreated n = 5 respectively. Statistical significance determined utilizing unpaired t test comparing average values ± SEM * P ≤.0 5. χ ² Test applied wherever applicable. Number of samples analyzed included indicated above. Data presented represent mean value ± standard error of means (s.e.m.).
