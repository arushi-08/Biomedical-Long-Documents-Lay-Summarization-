 editors can use to improve our understanding of complex biological systems such as animal symbioses or microbial communities associated with humans. This work provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that motility itself plays important roles beyond simple locomotion; indeed, many microbes have evolved mechanisms whereby their movement facilitates communication between themselves (e.g. quorum sensing) 1 0 - 2 3. Our results suggest another mechanism: direct interaction via surface appendages could facilitate exchange among cells within populations without requiring cell contact per se. It will be interesting if other motile microorganisms employ similar strategies involving secretion from one organism into its environment while simultaneously allowing others access at distal sites where they might benefit more directly. Finally, given recent interest regarding potential therapeutic applications based on LPS molecules 4 7 - 5 6, future studies should explore whether modulating flagellar activity would affect disease outcomes caused by pathogenic strains expressing flagellated surfaces decorated with immunostimulatory components like those described here. In addition, since V. harveyi does encode two distinct types of type IV pili — which do not require any additional proteins besides MotAB / C homologs -there remains much room open for exploration concerning non-canonical functions mediated by diverse prokaryotic nanomachines capable of rotating around solid substrates. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Strains used were E. coli DH5α λpir, SM1 0λ − pUT derivative strain S1 7ZIMCR 8 9, ES2 1n ΔflgK fliM mutant SMRS4 [gift of S.

All plasmids constructed using PCR products amplified from genomic DNA isolated according to standard protocols unless otherwise noted below were confirmed correct prior to transformation into appropriate recipient strains. pBADFLAGHis was created previously 8 9. For construction of pJN1 0 5L derivatives containing motB * alleles under control of native promoter sequences, fragments corresponding upstream plus coding sequence up until codon  2 1 of each gene except fimA were generated separately by overlap extension PCR. ftsEX constructs contained ~ 2kb regions flanking either side of the region targeted for mutagenesis along with codons  1-  2 1. pilMNOPQ variants included approximately half of the intergenic space separating all four genes. pelBCD fusions utilized roughly equal lengths of up- and downstream regulatory elements relative to the predicted translational initiation site of pelBC followed immediately after translation termination signal encoded by pelB. chiAVIH fusion vectors consisted solely of chiPHIJK fused together following removal of intervening nucleotides specifying amino acids  2-  1 5. cheYAZ chimeras comprised residues  3-  2 1 of CheY3 joined behind residue  -1 of CheY before replacement back onto full length ChpY protein beginning again just past position  -2 2. minCDE expression vector pSL1 carried entire operon comprising min locus {"type": "entrez-nucleotide", "attrs": {"text": "NC _ 0 0 2 6 5 5", "term _ id": "1 5 6 0 0 7 7 3", "term _ text": "NC _ 0 0 2 6 5 5"}} NC _ 0 0 2 6 5 5.g1 2.t1 0.y1 1.a1 separated out frame starting near base pair  -3 0 then ending shortly thereafter so no frameshifts occurred upon insertion of gfp casseted. pMTL8 3 1 5 1D plasmid carrying wild-type copies of mltC and nlpD cloned adjacent to Ptac yielded low levels of MlpC production even when induced strongly whereas introduction of frameshift mutations resulted in high level accumulation regardless of induction conditions suggesting instability due to premature stop codons.To construct pLAFR3 suicide delivery system compatible with
