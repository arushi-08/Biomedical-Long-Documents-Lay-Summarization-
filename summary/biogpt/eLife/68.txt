 role between two previously unrelated membrane protein families: MFS (multidrug resistance) transporter subunits and glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases / acylglyerophosphorylcholinases that we term GDE – AGL supercomplex formation. This finding provides new insights into lysosome function with implications beyond metabolic diseases such as cancer biology where both members have been implicated recently [1 0 8]. In addition our study suggests an unexpected link among different types of lipid metabolism including sphingolipid catabolism via sphingomyelin synthase 2 activity on one hand and phospholipid biosynthesis through phosphatidylcholine synthesis catalyzed by choline phosphotransferase domain containing 3 enzyme complexes at least partially dependent upon glmpc gene expression on another side. Finally it may be possible to exploit components within this newly discovered interaction network therapeutically because they could serve as targets against cancers characterized by high rates of glycolysis but also other disorders associated with abnormal glycosphingolipid homeostasis like Fabry ’ s Disease caused by mutations affecting α -galactosidase A. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Major Facilitator SuperFamily Transporter, Glycophosphodiesterase Domain Containing Protein, Glycerophosphocholine Phosphodiesterase, Sphingomyelin Synthase Pathway, Choline Phosphotransferase Enzyme Complex, Glycolipid Metabolism Disorders, Mouse Models < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Research organism: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Human; Other < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Membrane channels allow molecules inside cells — called ions - to move across membranes while keeping them outside so their concentration can stay constant throughout each cell's interior space. These ion channel pores open when certain signals activate specific enzymes which then add sugars onto some parts of those sugar chains attached to various amino acids found all over every molecule made up of DNA known as ‘ nucleic acid '. When activated many more genes produce similar structures referred to collectively as lipids around themselves instead of being covalently bonded together forming fatty substances named fats. Some fat compounds become part of biological membranes surrounding individual living organisms whereas others travel away leaving little behind what was originally produced during life itself. However there were no clear mechanisms described about moving water soluble small chemical entities out of human blood plasma before now. Now researchers know something goes wrong if any particular type of pore fails opening properly due to genetic defects leading people suffering from rare inherited conditions to accumulate toxic waste materials normally removed after birth. For example patients who lack functional versions of a single pump responsible for transporting chemicals out of red blood cells die young prematurely often having heart problems resulting directly from too much cholesterol accumulating in tissues rather than dying simply owing to faulty pumps alone. Understanding exactly why defective pumping leads to accumulation might help scientists find ways to treat related illnesses without killing healthy individuals unnecessarily. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > One group of highly conserved integral membrane proteins involved specifically in removing unwanted material includes ones belonging to the large class of solute carrier carriers. Another important category consists of multi pass trans-envelope glycoproteins located either intracellularly near organelles specialized for degrading old macromolecules termed “autophagy ” vacuoles or extracellularly facing vesicles released by damaged tissue macrophages termed exosomes. Both groups work closely alongside several additional classes of functionally diverse non-selective permeants whose exact roles still need further investigation although recent studies suggest involvement in nutrient sensing pathways regulating growth factor signaling cascades. To date only three mammalian ABC half size permease homologs had already received attention despite extensive searches using bioinformatics approaches suggesting hundreds likely exist even though most appear inactive under physiological circumstances unless stimulated artificially e.g. following exposure to drugs used clinically today. Here I describe experiments designed to identify novel putative drug efflux regulators working independently of ATP hydrolysis involving four distinct yet homologous sets of five long chain hydrophobic organic anions transported selectively back down electrochemical gradients generated solely by proton motive force utilizing energy stored primarily along hydrogen bonds formed reversibly between hydroxyl oxygen atoms lining substrate binding pockets contained entirely within relatively rigid internal cavities lined predominantly by aromatic residues surrounded by polar uncharged sidechains. Using mass spectrometry techniques combined with biochemical assays performed initially on mouse kidney brush border preparations followed later on whole organs excised post mortem allowed identification of candidate substrates identified subsequently confirmed experimentally thus far exclusively functioning physiologically independent of ATPase driven processes. Among candidates uncovered here are well established mitochondrial anion translocators SLC2 2A5 (OAT1) and SLC3 5A3 5 (OCTN2) operating respectively towards anionic metabolites excreted mainly apically and basolaterally whilst SLC1 7A9 transports bile salts secreted almost equally bidirectionally depending largely on whether sodium gradient potentials drive uptake or excretion. Two poorly studied orphan SLC paralogs designated SLC4 7A1 and A2 encoded by Slc4 1a1 and slc4a2 attracted special interest since neither has ever been shown biochemically nor bioinformatically to operate actively apart form ATPases albeit sharing 4 6% sequence identity overall making them good potential therapeutic target candidates especially considering previous reports implicating loss of Slc1a4 encoding GLUT4 glucose importers causing insulin insensitivity possibly explaining increased risk of diabetes mellitus observed amongst relatives carrying heterozygous inactivating variants of SLC4A1
