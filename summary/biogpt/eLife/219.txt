Long lasting forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity require new transcription resulting either directly via activation of nuclear signaling pathways downstream of neurotransmitter receptor stimulation or indirectly following modification / remodeling of existing synapses leading ultimately to altered patterns of connectivity between neurons. We have previously shown that RNA binding proteins play key roles both locally regulating mRNA translation required for spine growth but also acting more broadly across multiple subcellular domains controlling nucleo cytoplasmic trafficking of mRNAs encoding critical components involved in synaptogenesis and neural network function. However whether specific RBPs can act simultaneously throughout different cellular locations remains unknown. This study identifies one member of the large family of heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle associated splicing factors called RING finger domain ubiquitin ligase ten homolog (Rnf1 0l aka Rnuf l1 0) as being expressed specifically post synaptically along dendrites and localized predominantly near glutamatergic terminals suggesting its potential role in modulating neurotransmission mediated signal transduction cascades affecting global levels of transcript expression necessary for normal brain development and adult physiology. Furthermore our data suggest that while there may be functional redundancy among members of the same RBP class they do exhibit distinct sub regional localization profiles reflecting their unique physiological requirements depending upon cell type specificity and developmental stage. These results support previous studies showing differential distribution pattern amongst various hnRNP A / B related genes indicating possible non redundant biological activities despite similar biochemical properties. Moreover, given recent reports implicating mutations in several hnRNPs linked to neurodegenerative diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) further investigation regarding the precise molecular mechanism whereby individual isoforms exert neuroprotective effects could potentially reveal therapeutic targets against neurodegeneration caused by aberrant RNP metabolism. Our work provides additional insight towards understanding why certain individuals develop neurological disorders when carrying mutant alleles whereas others remain unaffected even though all carry identical genetic defects. It would therefore appear logical if future investigations should focus primarily around identifying those transcripts whose regulation depends solely on intact hnRNPA2B1 isoform rather than total pool size because loss of only single variant might result in subtle yet significant perturbations particularly under conditions involving increased demand e.g. stress exposure etc … Thus identification of functionally diverse variants present exclusively in affected patients versus healthy controls using next generation sequencing approaches coupled with high resolution imaging techniques holds great promise toward unraveling disease pathogenesis especially considering emerging evidences linking many other hnRNPs implicated in human pathologies to neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Overall, our current report suggests that although most known hnRNPs share common features i.e. association with pre ‐ spliced RNAs forming stable complexes together with core spliceosomal elements, each exhibits distinctive characteristics allowing them to perform specialized tasks inside cells thereby contributing significantly to overall complexity arising form genome wide transcriptome diversity. Further characterization of regulatory networks governed by select hnRPs promises valuable insights about basic principles governing mammalian nervous system functioning thus facilitating better diagnosis and treatment strategies targeting neuro degenerative maladies characterized so far mainly attributed to abnormal processing of nucleic acids. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
