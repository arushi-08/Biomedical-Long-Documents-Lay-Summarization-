 may be considered an "on / off switch ” controlling local actin polymerization at nascent or mature adhesive structures depending upon whether it contains active integrins with high affinity towards extracellular ligands or inactive ones without ligand binding capacity respectively. This mechanism could explain why cells need both force generation through actomyosin contractility and external traction forces during early stages but not later phases when stable contacts form independently from myosin activity 1 2 7 – 1 3 0. In addition our results suggest new strategies aimed at modulating cellular responses such as migration via manipulation of specific interactions within individual proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation rather than targeting global signaling pathways like Rho GTPases activation. Finally, since many cancer therapies target key regulators of cytoskeleton dynamics including kinases, phosphatases etc … Our study suggests novel ways forward based on understanding molecular mechanisms underlying spatial organization of intracellular networks regulating motility processes important e.g. metastasis formation.. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Integrin Adhesion Complexes, Focal Adhesions, Actin Cytoskeleton Dynamics, Fluorescence Cross Correlation Spectroscopy, Molecular Motors, Diffusion Coefficient, Protein Exchange Rate constants, Cell Migration < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > ► Cytosolic pools exist for most major constituents of the mammalian integrin adhesome.2. These molecules have similar diffusion coefficients indicating comparable sizes distributions.3. They show fast turnover rates suggesting transient interaction partners. Thus all known members of the human integrin adhesomes appear capable of assembling into large macromolecular assemblies even before being recruited there where other factors assemble them together forming functional adhesions. www.nature.com / scientificreports www.nature.com / srep = supporting information file  S1 5 6 4 8 9 9.This work was supported by grants from Deutsche Forschungsgemeinshaft SFB TRR5 7 - Project B2“ Cellular Assembly Line Model of Tissue Morphogenesis ”; DFG Cluster of Excellence REBIRTH Grant EXC1 1 5 Collaborative Research Centre No. 1 1 5A4 9 'Structural basis for mechanotransduction ’ funded by the German Ministry of Education & Science under grant no.

One way organisms achieve complex functions involves compartmentalization of biochemical reactions leading either directly to defined outcomes or indirectly providing additional layers of specificity resulting in more precise tuning of output parameters. Such compartmentalized modules include membrane microdomains enriched in particular lipids species creating lipid rafts whose size depends strongly on cholesterol content whereas others contain scaffolding proteins- caveolae scaffolded mainly by caveolin coat components--surrounded by scaffold domains containing PDZ domain interacting molecules` PDLIM2 respectively.Another example includes nuclear pores composed mostly of nucleoporins embedded in double layered proteinaceous shells surrounding chromosomes ensuring selective transport only those macromolecules passing though themajorallysized pore complexes.All three examples above involve direct physical contact among compartment parts facilitating communication amongst compartments although some also rely additionally on chemical communications mediated bysmall molecule intermediatesto facilitate crosstalk betweensignalingpathwaysin vivo. A third type of spatially organized module consists ofmultiprotein scaffolds localized close enough apart yet still able tointeract physically witheach other`s counterparts giving rise to larger supramolecular entities called membraneless organelles ´ characterized by liquid demixing properties rendering possible highly sensitive response mechanisms.Examples hereof include stress granules formed around stalled translation initiation factorsas well as P body foci consisting primarily of RNA decay enzymes bound non covalently to mRNA transcripts stabilized against degradation andcytoplasmic processing bodiescontainings mRNAs translationally repressed until needed only.While much has been learned about subcellular localization patterns of various biomolecules, less attention has focused specifically on determining if certain biomolecular units remain associated following recruitment onto specialized regions despite having moved away laterally along cytoskeletalfilaments. For instance does clustering occur prior to recruitmentationwhereabouts what happens once clusters
