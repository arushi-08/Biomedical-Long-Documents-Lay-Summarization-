 molecules such as host factors or drugs targeting specific steps during infection may represent promising strategies against retroviral infections. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV) has evolved an elegant strategy involving multiple interactions among its structural proteins Gag polyprotein Pr5 5gag, nucleocapsid protein NCp7, matrix domain MA, integrase enzyme IN, reverse transcriptase RT, protease PR, Vpr accessory factor Vif, Vpu viroporin Nef, cellular restriction factors TRIM5α, TRIMCyp, MxB, SAMHD1, Tetherin, SERINC5 etc.. During assembly at membranes, CA forms hexameric rings connected through their C termini into helical bundles forming immature particles; upon proteolytic cleavage from precursor polypeptide CAp2 4gag, mature cores form containing approximately 2 0 0hexamers arranged on a hexagonal surface lattice We recently reported our development of methods allowing us to monitor directly individual intact virions undergoing spontaneous disintegration ex vivo using total internal re ection uorescence microscope TIRF Microscopy allows direct visualization of both early events associated with fusion pore formation and late post entry processes including core stability following cell attachment. Here, we describe new approaches enabling monitoring de novo generation of defects within native conical shaped HIV-1NL4 3 cones under conditions mimicking those occurring inside cells: i) permeabilization of virion envelope via addition of detergent Triton X-1 0 0 ii) removal of soluble components iii) incubation of permeabilized viruses with ATP generating system iv) observation of uncoated cone structures over several hours v) analysis of kinetic parameters describing progression towards complete dismantling of each observed structure vi) determination of critical concentration values corresponding to half maximal rates of appearance of defective intermediates viii. comparison of effects induced by known inhibitors affecting distinct phases of replication cycle. These studies reveal important differences regarding regulation mechanisms controlling initial versus later stage of uncoating suggesting potential targets for antiviral therapy aimed either preventing premature activation before completion of genome delivery or stabilizing incoming complexes until they reach sites where integration occurs. < / FREETEXT > < / SECTION > ▃ ▃ < RESULT > < FREETEXT > Results & discussion ▃ Monitoring natural decay pathways leading to disappearance of assembled wild type HIV-1 tubes A er removing all non-spectator bound nucleotides by extensive dialysis, freshly prepared samples were incubated overnight without any additional additives. Under standard assay conditionsi.e. presence of Mg + ions -most assemblies remained stable throughout experiments while some small fraction underwent slow gradual decrease in intensity due to photobleaching (Fig. As expected based on previous reports For further characterization of changes accompanying loss of signal intensities caused by bleaching, dark state lifetimes t D s measured for various objects varied signicantly depending on size and shape (Table Next, we monitored temporal evolution of bright spots present initially in sample solutions obtained just above equilibrium concentrations determined previously Using similar experimental approach described earlier, we also analyzed dynamics of dark- eld images recorded shortly a erwards when no more visible signs of tube breakdown could yet been detected visually (Fig. k obs ¼ K d [P] n H ðKdÞ Equation was used here instead of pseudo rst order approximation assuming one site per hexamer since only about 6% of available holes remain open even though overall population density remains high enough to allow detection of many dim dimmer dots representing partially opened lattices. This assumption appears reasonable considering relatively low number of accessible pores compared to average occupancy estimated previously.T h value calculated according to eqn. corresponds well to experimentally derived data shown in Fig. Finally, we performed quantitative analyses comparing relative fractions of bright- "dead ends" vs. faint ringlike structures.The results presented so far indicate existence of two kinetically distinguishable populations whose ratio depends on temperature and duration of experiment. However, given limited resolution power provided by conventional imaging techniques, detailed mechanistic interpretation requires information concerning distribution functions characterizing spatial distributions of brightness states along contour lines drawn across entire image areas covered by selected object classes. Such histograms show clear evidence of heterogeneity underlying dynamic behavior displayed by studied systems (see ESI † section IV for details). Thus, rather than analyzing mean properties extracted from histogram plots alone, we decided next to analyze them quantitatively taking advantage of statistical tools routinely employed successfully in other elds of science providing insight into complex molecular phenomena driving biological reactions. First, we examined whether apparent broadening seen in raw spectra might result simply from variation in local environment surrounding chromophores making emission less efficient e.g. because of quenching effect exerted by nearby residues located close together. Indeed, if there exists correlation between spectral features characteristic of particular species then broad peaks should appear somewhereelse around peak positions typical for mixed composition. Analysis revealed indeed strong dependence of width parameter w app on wavelength indicating possible contribution of quenched emitters contributing significantly to line shapes near maximum absorption wavelengths (blue region centered ca $8 9 nm) whereas narrow bands appeared otherwise (red part centred approx. ~ 9 6 nm. www.nature.com / scientificreports / second derivative curves showed very good agreement with Gaussian ts showing maxima typically shi ed toward shorter wavelengths consistent with expectations arising out of simple photophysical considerations outlined above.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry
