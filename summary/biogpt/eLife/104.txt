In addition there exists crosstalk among different lineages involving cytokines secreted locally which can either promote Th1 polarization while inhibiting Th2 responses leading towards allergic inflammation mediated primarily byIL ‐ 4i vs. IFN ‑ γ respectively, but may involve additional factors depending upon local cytokine milieu. For example Th1skewing occurs when TGF ‑ β drives naive precursors toward IFNγ production whereas under conditions favoring Th2 induction they favor IL4 secretion.Conversely IL1 2p7 0promotes expansion of both IFNg producing effector CD8 cytotoxic lineage members along withIL4- secreting regulatory subsets termed Tr1s characterized by high levels of interleukin -1 0 (IL - 1 0).1 Thus it becomes important not only to define molecular pathways involved in regulating each subset individually so we might better predict disease outcomes based thereon.2 However our understanding remains incomplete because many aspects of cellular biology underlying specific processes controlling naiveTH fate decisions still need further elucidation especially those pertaining to events occurring prior this.3 Indeed several recent reports suggest key roles played by microRNAs in modulating gene expression.4 Moreover epigenetic modifications play crucial role in determining whether precursor cellsdestined to become mature effectors will undergo terminal differentiation.5 Finally post translational modification has been shown to regulate stability of mRNA transcripts encoding various components required for proper functioning of innate immunity pathways.6Therefore identifying novel regulators playing central rolesacting upstream would help elucidate fundamental biological principles underpinning adaptive immunity.7 Here using forward genetics approach combined with next gen sequencing technology led to identification of blottin hostmutants harboring missense point mutationshiftablecording zfp3 5a gene.8 As expected given theirpredicted functions betweenZpf3 5A family member ’ s encoded proteins8 all affected animals exhibited severe defects in B lymphopoiesis resulting in reduced numbers circulating peripheral blood B2 2 0- positive cells. however unexpectedly some had normal number of splenic IgM memory population suggesting possible differences in requirements for maintaining homeostasis versus generating antibody response against foreign antigen.9 Surprisingly although no significant difference was observed whatsoever regarding total splenocyte counts compared wtih wild types control littermates were noted after analyzing thymusesderived immature single positives (ISP = TCRlo CD2 5- DN2a thymocytes) isolated fromBlt\ moths homozygous for mutated allele showed significantly lower proportion than controls indicating impaired transition out of DN stage where most αβ TCR signallingoccurs.1 0 Furthermore analysis revealed decreased proportions of SP CD4hi CD8low double negative compartment consistent with previous reports.1 1 Interestingly despite having similar percentages of DP populations overall fewer SPs developed althoughmore progressed beyond CD3- pre-selecting state since less differentiated CD3 − CD5 dull CD6 9lowCD1 1a highNKR int phenotype predominated over higher matured CD3hiCD5 bright CD6 9- NK dim population. lest again unlike what obseved previously reported results showing increased frequency of γδ TSCM subpopulation wasn't observed1 2 perhaps reflecting distinct genetic background used here vs C5 7BL / 6J strain employed previously.1 3 Overall these data suggested possibilty involvement of ZPF3 5A2 in promoting efficient progression though late transitional states before commitment to αβTCRs signaling pathway thereby contributing importantly to developing functional repertoire diversity necessary for effective host defense mechanisms.1 4 To confirm if lack of nullZPf3 5A1 resulted indeed leads to defective iNKT differentation, splenocytes obtained form controlsand homozygotes werestimulated ex vivo with α -GalCer followed by intracellular staining for NK1. 1- marker together with CD1d tetramer conjugated to Ova peptide H2 K b restricted epitope OVA2 5 7Latex conjugate serving as surrogate ligand for Vα1 4.Jα3 3.IT1 NKT cloneformers1 5 demonstrated markedly diminished percentage of iNKT subpopulations bearing invariant V alpha J region rearrangement characteristic of conventional natural killer T lines1 6 even without any alteration in frequencies γδTconv counterparts lacking canonical rearrangements.2 Taken altogether these observations indicated requirement for ZPF A3 5 isoform activity in mediating optimal transitions across multiple maturational steps needed for appropriate establishment of diverse repertoires capable of responding appropriately following antigenic stimulation. It should now turn interesting question about mechanism whereby loss of ZPF3 5A2 affects downstream consequences
