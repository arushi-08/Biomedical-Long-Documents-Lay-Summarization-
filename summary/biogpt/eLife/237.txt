 motors such as Kif2A at both poles; however, other factors must contribute for accurate division plane positioning without compromising mitosis duration or fidelity. These results establish experimental systems with which one can investigate fundamental questions about cellular morphogenesis including those related to cancer progression where altered tissue architecture may arise due to changes in growth rates associated with increased tumor ploidy levels 1 – 5. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Kinesin motor proteins, Spindle assembly checkpoint signaling pathway, Mitosis length control, Cell cycle regulation, Cytokinesis timing, Microtubule dynamics, Importin alpha protein family members, Mitotic spindle geometry maintenance, Chromosome alignment defects, Kinetochore attachment errors, Aneuploid divisions < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > The goal was first set up to determine whether our extract model could recapitulate key aspects of embryonic spindle formation observed previously 6. For example, it has been shown recently that early cleavage stages exhibit large variations in nuclear sizes compared to later embryo types suggesting there might be some sort of “sensing ” process operating within blastomeres 2 9. In addition, recent work showed that microtubules grow faster than predicted based on their lengths alone indicating they have dynamic instability properties similar to interphase cortical arrays found elsewhere throughout animal tissues 3 0. Finally, previous studies reported significant increases in overall tubulin polymer mass per unit volume over time consistent with increasing numbers of nuclei undergoing DNA replication cycles leading ultimately into multiple daughter cells each containing half genome equivalents relative to mother nucleus after cytokinesis completion 6. Therefore, all three parameters were measured simultaneously across different age groups ranging from egg activation until late blastula transition just prior to gastrulation onset (Figure 1A & B). As expected, total polymerized tubulins decreased significantly upon fertilization followed immediately thereafter by dramatic increase beginning around mid gastrulae corresponding approximately to MBT initiation (~ 2hrs post fertilisation [hpf]) reaching maximum values near hatching larvae (6dpf = 8hr post- hatch) while remaining relatively constant beyond 7dpf representing adult frogs (Fig 1B top panel). This pattern closely matches what had already been described earlier showing very high variability among individual blastomere volumes before MZT induction resulting in highly variable number of somatic stem cells derived directly from pluripotent germ line progenitors called neoblasts versus differentiated lineages arising via asymmetric partitioning events termed endomesoderm specification occurring shortly following zygotic gene expression programs induced by maternal transcription factor Zygotic genes expressed only once zygote undergoes its final round of S phase thus allowing them to function independently whereas maternally inherited transcripts persist longer providing additional support functions required for normal development past midsegmentation period 3 1. Consistent with observations made above regarding decreasing average oocyte diameter along oogenesis maturation axis starting at Stage I oocytes becoming smaller then larger again culminating in mature eggs being twice the initial oocyte diameters at ovulation, mean fluorescence intensity measurements revealed gradual decreases in fluorescent signal intensities reflecting progressively lower amounts of GFP labeled EB1 binding sites present on growing plus ends of astral MTs emanating out toward cortex surface membranes marking centrosomes thereby confirming progressive reduction in MT nucleation rate concomitant with reduced centrosome size also known to occur concomitantly with meiotic resumption under physiological conditions 3 2 (Supplementary figure S1 A + C). Interestingly though, although no statistically significance difference exists amongst various ages tested here except for two points i.e. 5hpf vs. 9hpf p value ≤.0 5 and 6dpf vs 7dpf P Value ≥.1 respectively, data shows trend towards higher amount of EB signals detected initially perhaps because of presence of small fraction of immature oogonia still arrested at prophase I. However, since most of the experiments presented below focus exclusively on comparing younger samples collected soon after meiosis resumes (e.g. pre-MBT times point onwards unless otherwise stated), any potential contribution provided by residual meiotically inactive population will likely remain insignificant even if minor effects do exist given low frequency occurrence of meioses arrest seen experimentally so far. Furthermore, despite slight fluctuations noted especially at older sample collection dates possibly owing to temperature variation affecting stability of certain components involved in regulating spindle morphology like NuMA etc., general trends clearly indicate steady decline in several features analyzed herein namely: i) Total polymeric tubulin content ii) Average distance separating sister kinetochores iii) Mean kinetochore fiber density iv) Number of chromosomes attached to bipolar spindles.Taken together, analysis suggests establishment of reproducible assay capable of recapitulating major characteristics underlying complex processes taking place inside living organisms making use of easily accessible material obtained non invasively from fertilized frog ova. Moreover, unlike live imaging approaches requiring expensive equipment and specialized expertise often unavailable outside laboratories working primarily on basic biological problems involving Drosophila melanogaster models, assays developed here allow researchers interested solely in investigating molecular basis behind specific phenomena encountered physiologically more readily available tools enabling direct comparison against existing literature generated mostly utilizing mammalian cultured cell lines grown either adherently or suspended cultures amenable to transfection protocols commonly used today. Importantly, future directions should include testing applicability of the same approach employed presently employing human HeLa S3 culture adapted versions of reagents currently commercially purchased now widely utilized routinely in studying mechanistic details
