 functions required for accurate meiotic cell division: it protects centromeric sister chromatid arm cohesins from separase cleavage; promotes their removal at anaphase onset through APC / C- dependent degradation during prometaphase or metaphase depending upon whether they have been protected against proteolysis via phosphorylation by Plk1 before nuclear envelope breakdown 1 5 – 3 0 min after NEBD; regulates bipolar attachment of kinetochores onto microtubules prior to establishment of tension across them once chromosomes align along the equatorial plate towards opposite poles; facilitates stable amphitelic attachments following initial capture so that when both sisters attach simultaneously there will be no further stretch imposed on either one until all pairs achieve proper alignment under full inter-KT tensions then allowing rapid release back into prophase I. Thus we propose that SGol2s act not only as protectors but also regulators of key events involved in ensuring faithful chromosomal disjunction including protection of centromere integrity early in mitosis followed later by regulation of k − MT dynamics which together ensure timely progression though M phase exit without premature loss of mitotic fidelity. This study provides new insights about mechanisms underlying error correction pathways operating specifically within female germ cells where errors can lead directly to aneuploidy resulting in infertility while somatic mutations may contribute significantly to cancer predisposition [4 8]. It suggests potential avenues toward therapeutic intervention aimed at correcting such defects thereby preventing birth defects.Significance Statement The generation of viable offspring requires precise control over each step leading up to successful separation of homologous maternal chromatids during oocyte maturation culminating ultimately in fertilization. Errors arising due to faulty execution of any stage result inevitably in aneuploid eggs whose development cannot proceed normally thus compromising fertility whilst increasing risk factors associated with increased incidence rates of cancers include age related aneuploidies caused primarily because females accumulate more than males genetic damage throughout life making reproduction particularly vulnerable even if repair systems remain intact. Here using mouse models combined with live imaging approaches reveals novel roles played by shugoshin- Like Protein 2 (SGO2) distinct from those previously described involving other members of the same family namely MELT proteins our data suggest two separate modes whereby SGO2L acts sequentially first to promote correct localization of centromeres relative to the spindle equator and subsequently regulate stability of kMTs providing mechanistic insight regarding why mice lacking Sgol2exhibit reduced fecundity despite normal levels of recombination per se suggesting possible targets for future therapies designed around restoring function rather than simply inhibiting expression. Our results highlight specific molecular players acting downstream of SGO1 enabling us to better understand fundamental aspects underpinning human reproductive biology and disease pathogenesis linked to defective DNA replication stress response pathway components known collectively as Fanconi Anemia genes. Furthermore given recent evidence implicating FANCM helicase deficiency causing primary ovarian failure coupled with high risks of breast carcinoma indicating significant overlap among different FA subtypes, understanding common regulatory networks governing cellular responses could potentially help identify additional candidates contributing to inherited forms of gonadal dysfunction highlighting opportunities for targeted therapy based strategies aiming to restore functionality instead of merely reducing gene dosage alone.

PP2Aα subunit A & B subunits, BubR1 Kinase inhibitor motif etc.. These mutants expressed well compared to wild type form although some appeared unstable especially when co-transfected with wildtype construct implying dominant negative effects exerted possibly owing to competition for available endogenous partner molecules. As expected deletion of N terminus resulted in complete abrogation of association with PPP2R1A whereas deletions affecting TPR repeats did not affect association with B5 6δ confirming previous observations made elsewhere (Fig 2A top panel lanes marked “WT ” vs ΔN1 + N2 * , lane" ΔC '' vs. ΔN ′ ″ -term *, lane "ΔS'Δ '´ ‘ ∆ S ’ ′ … ’). Deletion analysis revealed that neither the central nor carboxy termini was essential for targeting SGO to chromatin unlike what has recently reported for yeast homologue Mph1 albeit truncations deleting amino acids comprising part of the conserved SPDR repeat motifs failed to localize properly consistent with studies showing requirement of similar residues for efficient nucleolar accumulation of fission Yeast orthologue Swi6p (Fig 2B upper panels compare GFP signal intensities in nuclei stained positively for DAPI staining shown above bars labelled“ WT ” versus indicated truncation variants)
