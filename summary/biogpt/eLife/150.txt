 objects (e.g. animals) rather than optimizing speed or accuracy per se; they also highlight important limitations on current models for understanding human behavior during natural vision tasks such as reading aloud text. ▃ ▃ ▃ SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT ▃ We investigated whether observers actively sample images based upon their own experience within complex naturalistic environments while performing visually guided actions like recognizing words presented at different spatial positions relative to each other. Participants looked more often toward areas where word recognition would be easier but not necessarily faster: regions containing animal names compared against non-object background features. This suggests that people use strategies similar to those used previously in artificial settings involving relatively simple stimuli - sampling quickly so it can efficiently represent large amounts of data without sacrificing either efficiency or precision. However, even after taking into account differences between individual subjects due primarily to variability across trials, there remained substantial variation among individuals regarding which parts of image sequences attracted attention most frequently suggesting some degree of idiosyncratic decision making processes may influence what happens next once fixations have been selected. These observations help constrain theories concerning mechanisms underlying real world perception / action interactions under conditions likely encountered outside laboratory experiments. They further demonstrate potential benefits associated with incorporating explicit feedback via interactive computer graphics systems designed specifically for studying everyday cognition through experimental manipulations over time. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃
