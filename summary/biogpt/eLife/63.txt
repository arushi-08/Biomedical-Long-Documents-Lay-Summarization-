 could help explain why some animals have evolved specialized neural circuits for detecting behaviorally important stimulus features while others do not.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The ability to perceive specific environmental cues is critical during development as well as adulthood; however it remains unclear whether evolution has shaped or simply followed existing mechanisms used across taxa when perceiving similar information from diverse environments. Here we show that two closely related mormyromast fish lineages use distinct electrophysiological strategies: one uses temporally precise spiking patterns ("temporal jumpers") whereas another relies on spontaneous oscillations without spikes at all ("non-jumper" electroreceptive neurons). Temporal jumpers also exhibit greater sensitivity than other cells types tested here toward conspecific social calls containing frequency modulations known to be salient behaviorally.Our results suggest there may exist multiple solutions available within animal populations depending upon ecological constraints such as resource availability. This work provides insight regarding possible selective pressures shaping neuronal physiology over time through natural selection experiments designed specifically around ecologically significant behaviors rather than general measures like body size alone. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
