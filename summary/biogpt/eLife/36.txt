 editor & reviewer Information: If your article has been judged scientifically suitable for publication based on all reviewers' comments, then it will be formally accepted without peer review at eLife. Your manuscript may also undergo an external validation process by Randy Schekman's group before acceptance, but only if they can confirm their claims with statistical significance. Once submitted, however, our decision letter should indicate whether such formal approval would be necessary [see comment 1].Note: This revised version was first published online 2 5 October 2 0 1 7; there were no new experiments required except minor text changes made during revision processes.. Reviewers have indicated none known conflicts of interest associated withthis paper. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Background information For more details please refer to Point 3 below regarding statistics used throughout the study section.

Following stereotaxic surgery, brains exposed through craniotomy show evidence of trauma characterized primarily byedema around the site oflesion followed later onlyby hemorrhage along needle track indicating successful delivery of virus particles across ventricular walls (Fig 1B). To assess potential effects of viral infection alone versus combined surgical procedure plus lentiviral transduction upon neuronal survival over time, whole mount immunohistochemistry against GFP revealed similar numbers of neurons surviving up to2weeks post- injectionaltimepoint regardless of treatment type suggesting minimal effect caused solely by either intervention (Figs 1C and1D). However, while most cells survived well beyond 1week postinjury, some showed signs oflong beading indicative of degenerating neurites consistent with previous studies reporting neurodegeneration afterexcitotoxic lesions inDrosophila melanogaster larval central nervous system models1 7.The same approach could potentially allow us to monitor any long term consequences resulting fromtransgene overexpression itself since lentivirus vectors integrate randomly wherever transduced cells.As shown previously, widespread distribution of YFP positive axons occurs radially away from ventricle wall outlining forebrain structures reminiscent of axonal projections emanating rostrallyout ventricles.3 While overall neuron density appeared unaffected relative to controls, subtle differences did emerge among individual transgenic lines depending on level of exogenous protein expression.8 Specifically, high levels of mutant Tau3R1N led to increased dendritic branching whereas low levelsresulted in reduced complexity suggestive of impaired synaptic connectivity possibly related to altered microtubule dynamics observed previously.9 Interestingly, even though both wild type3N4R and mutated forms appear equally toxic themselves, co ‐ injecting wildtype tau2N3R together with mutantTau3R3N appears protective perhaps because excess soluble WT proteins sequester misfolded Mutatedproteins.1 8Thus, although virally mediated gene transfer does result in robust ectopic expression patterns outside targeted regions, its impact seems limited enough so thatother approaches need to be considered forfuture studies.4 < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Figures 2A through2C showexamples of confocal z stack reconstructions obtained one month lateringstereotactic implantation of LV encoding mCherry controlvs Venus tagged versions of wildtyemutant hTau3R2N + EGFP fusion constructs driven by CMV promoter. Both transgenes express predominantly cytoplasmic isoforms of TAU fused N terminal to fluorophore reporters allowing visualization of subcellular localization patterns.3 Expression pattern analysis reveals diffuse neuropil staining typical of endogenous TAURs expressed normally in mature neurons3 accompanied occasionally by rare neuritic aggregations resembling neurofibrillary tangles seen postmortem in AD brains.2 Indeed, quantitative image analyses reveal higher frequency offollowed puncta representing aggregated vs. dispersed cytosolic pools of fluorescently labeled HTurquoise variants of overexpressed TAU reflecting formation of insoluble filamentous deposits characteristic of pathological states (Fig 2D). Importantly, quantification confirms comparable fluorescence intensity profiles demonstrating equivalent amounts of total cellular content being analyzed irrespective of construct identity thus validating use of imaging techniques developed elsewhere for quantifying aggregate load directly used.6 Moreover, western blot analysisconfirmed presence of full length recombinant proteins corresponding to expected molecular weights detected specifically by anti ‐ RFP antibody confirming integrity of chimeric molecules generated despite cleavage events occurring somewhichway upstream thec terminus of native TAU molecule leading to loss of fluorophores attached therefore.7 Finally, double labeling immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates
