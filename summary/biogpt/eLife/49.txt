 clocks within each tissue type which may be important for synchronising rhythms with external cues such as light intensity changes during daylight hours (Figure 1). This work provides new insights into understanding both temporal organisation on an organismal scale by examining whole plants rather than just isolated tissues, but more importantly reveals novel information about cellular timekeeping mechanisms underlying rhythmic behaviour from intact multicellular organisms like those found throughout nature. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
