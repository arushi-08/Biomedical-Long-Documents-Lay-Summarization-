 may have therapeutic potential for autism spectrum disorders by restoring normal perceptual experience during interpersonal communication. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction ▃ Social interaction involves both verbal exchange between two or more people (e.g. conversation) and nonverbal behavior including facial expressions, bodily movements etc.. In contrast to human beings who can communicate verbally from their first year on, nonhuman animals do not develop language until after birth Our previous studies showed that humans perceive longer durations when interacting physically With respect to other species' communicative behaviors, it has been shown that chimpanzees show similar patterns regarding interactional timing When viewing video clips depicting an actress performing different types of actions, monkeys tend to overestimate short intervals while underestimating long ones We recently reported evidence suggesting that some aspects of embodied cognition might reflect individual differences among young children; specifically, infants whose parents had higher levels of attachment anxiety tended to exhibit greater overestimation bias toward brief events While there was no significant difference found across groups concerning age distribution, participants were all right handed according to Edinburgh Handedness Inventory scores All experiments involving healthy adults gave written informed consent following approval provided by Institutional Review Board at Keio University School of Medicine. Participants received 1 0 mL nasal spray containing either 2 4 IU Oxytocin dissolved into sterile water or 5 mg Atosibant solution diluted using saline before participating in experiment. Each participant completed three experimental sessions separated by approximately 3 days each under placebo condition followed immediately thereafter by drug treatment conditions. For details about study design see SI Appendix S1. A total number of 6 8 subjects participated successfully completing four trials per session resulting in 9 7 data points collected over six separate testing occasions. Data collection took place within five months starting March 1st, 2 0 1 7.Results revealed that movie clip segments displaying interactive action exhibited reduced mean length relative to non-Interactive Action Segments regardless whether the actor acted alone or together with another person (Fig 1A & 1B). This result suggests that perceiving moment-scale information pertaining to movement sequence plays important role in determining overall impression size irrespective if actors act individually or cooperatively. Importantly however, the degree of shortening varied greatly depending upon subject's level of ASD traits measured via AQ questionnaire score (Table To examine possible mechanisms underlying observed effects, we conducted correlation analyses examining relationships between AQ measure values obtained prior to any intervention and changes induced by OT vs. AT treatments respectively. As expected based on earlier reports demonstrating positive relationship Between group comparisons indicated that only Group C receiving OT demonstrated reduction in underestimation biases towards Short Intervals (p =.0 0 0 1 * * *) but did so without affecting Mean Length estimates (p =.1 1 2). No change occurred in Groups B nor A. On the contrary, AT caused increase in estimation errors related to Long Interval Duration (i.e. Increase in underestimation error for Long interval segment, p =.0 0 0 1-.2 1 0ns) although its impact seemed limited because no corresponding decrease could also be detected in terms of Mean Length estimate (P ≥.5 9NS). Thus, results demonstrate differential impacts exerted by OT versus ATswhich supports the notion that exogenous application of OXT selectively modulates certain aspect of visual processing associated with inter personal communications. It should noted here again that most behavioral measures used throughout present work include multiple items reflecting various dimensions characterizing performance accuracy and response consistency. Therefore, further analysis will need to consider what specific factors contribute to altered judgment precision along particular dimension. Nevertheless, taken collectively, current observations support the idea that subtle alterations occurring early in development affect subsequent adult functioning. Specifically, given recent advances revealing critical roles played by brain regions involved in self awareness During infancy, reciprocal exchanges play key developmental functions relating closely to later socio emotional competence. Infants rely heavily on parental guidance to guide them developing appropriate responses Towards understanding why atypical perceptions occur despite seemingly intact sensory systems, we examined correlations between baseline physiological parameters [heart rate variability] and judgments made post manipulation. Heart rates recorded just preceding stimulus presentation served as indices of autonomic arousal state. Although preliminary due to small sample sizes, neither Baseline HR nor HRV differed substantially amongst high vs low scorers on Autism Spectrum Quotient Scale (AQ) indicating comparable sympathetic activity states Among several variables tested, none predicted improvement produced by OT treatment.The lack of association indicates that improved ability does not depend solely on peripheral physiology However, since increased parasympathetic tone often accompanies enhanced attention capacity, we speculate that heightened attentional focus likely contributes to better discrimination abilities seen Post Treatment. Taken altogether, above observation provides initial indication supporting the hypothesis that exogenously applied neuropeptides modulate neural circuits responsible for generating internal representations necessary for accurate interpretation of external stimuli. Further investigation would require detailed examination focusing particularly on cortical areas known to underlie emotion recognition and empathy Given the fact that many facets of neuroendocrinology involve complex interplay between central nervous system structures and periphery organs, future investigations must address questions raised herein. First, even though neuropeptide receptors exist outside blood vessels, circulating hormones cannot cross cell membranes easily. Second, peptides released locally exert relatively slow diffusion properties making precise localization difficult Even then, direct injection methods
