 for defining different physiological conditions related to altered arousal.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe transition between awake behavior or consciousness during natural waking experience as well as under anesthetic agents can be described using measures derived directly from neuronal signals recorded at multiple spatial scales within cortical networks: local field potentials; spike trains; multi unit activities; scalp electroencephalography - all measured over time periods ranging up totens seconds. Here, we show that one such measure termed'slow wave frequency slopes' provides an alternative approach towards characterizing changes across behavioral states.We find evidence supporting previous reports suggesting that low frequencies reflect synaptic strength whereas high frequencies represent axonal conduction velocity along axons connecting distant regions throughout cortex. Our results suggest that both processes contribute significantly toward determining global network dynamics underlying cognitive function but may operate independently depending upon their respective temporal characteristics. These observations have implications beyond neuroscience because they offer novel approaches for understanding human cognition through analysis of spontaneous fluctuations observed outside task performance paradigms. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
