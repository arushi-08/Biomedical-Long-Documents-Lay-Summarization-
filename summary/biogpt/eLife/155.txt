 < / FREETEXT > ▃ ▃ < ABSTRACT > < FREETEXT > The ventral occipitotemporal cortex is involved both during perception tasks requiring categorization or discrimination between stimuli from different semantic domains as well as when viewing images depicting objects with distinct functions 1 – 3. This region has been traditionally divided into two functionally specialized areas: an anterior part called Visual Word Form Area 4 which responds preferentially to words 5; 6 while posterior parts known as Object Recognition Areas 7 respond selectively either to pictures 8, 9 or faces 2, 3. More recently it was proposed also including other object related regions such as those located at lateral occipital complex within category specific clusters named Lateral Geniculate Body Complex 1 0. These studies have shown clear differences among brain activation patterns elicited by word versus picture presentation suggesting some degree of specialization along each processing stream but they did not address whether there might be any difference across modalities regarding representation mechanisms per se. In particular no study so far investigated neural representations underlying auditory recognition memory processes associated specifically with speech comprehension compared to non verbal vocalizations like environmental noises. Here we addressed this question comparing cortical activity evoked respectively through passive listening conditions involving natural spoken sentences vs. continuous white noise stimulation applied on subjects who had undergone complete bilateral blindness before puberty due to retinopathy caused by prematurity birth complications [Early Blind Subjects]. To assess possible effects linked to modality specificity, participants performed identical experimental procedures under monocular condition where only right eye light source remained active throughout scanning sessions thus allowing us disentangling contributions arising exclusively form left hemisphere structures. Results showed significant activations bilaterally distributed over temporal lobes extending anteriorly towards inferior frontal gyrus after hearing meaningful sentence material whereas exposure to noisy background produced significantly weaker signals mainly confined to superior parietal lobe. Importantly, analysis revealed greater BOLD signal changes following stimulus onset relative to baseline levels particularly evident around primary sensory cortices irrespective of task type indicating higher sensitivity toward incoming information regardless if heard passively via audition vs sight although overall stronger modulation occurred upon scene encoding consistent with previous reports showing enhanced perceptual abilities driven primarily by experience acquired postnatally even though cross modal plasticity can occur later still 1 1.Moreover our data show evidence supporting existence of multiple parallel pathways linking subcortical nuclei directly connected with extrastriate associative neocortex thereby providing direct access to high level linguistic knowledge without need of input coming back from striato − thalamo − collicular loop circuits. Finally comparison analyses indicate increased recruitment of dorsal fronto - opercular network components especially engaged whenever scenes must first undergo conceptual transformation prior to being recognized independently of language ability implying involvement of executive control system possibly subserved by Broca ’ s area. Overall present observations support view according to which human brains possess highly efficient systems capable of extracting meaning out of seemingly incomprehensible inputs independent of external sensorial cues hence opening new perspectives about what may constitute basic building blocks enabling successful communication acquisition outside conscious awareness. Further investigations will help clarify why certain aspects seem less robust depending on age since earlier stages could benefit most likely from training programs aimed at improving cognitive skills required for effective use of augmentative devices based on sign languages instead of relying solely on oral expression alone. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Auditory Processing, Brain Imaging, Functional Magnetic Resonance imaging, Language Acquisition, Speech Comprehension, Sensory Integration Disorders < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Research Highlights < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > What does "Semantic Categorization" mean here?

Such relations allow organisms to communicate effectively and efficiently sharing common goals and interests. For instance animals share many attributes making them easily recognizable e.g. birds recognize humans very accurately thanks to learned associations formed between species typical facial expressions and vocal characteristics (Kemler et al., 2 0 0 4). Similarly social interactions often rely heavily on understanding others' mental states i.e. emotions expressed verbally and nonverbal behaviors displayed accordingly. As illustrated above, several lines of evidences converge pointing to commonalities existing beyond mere similarities among members of various taxa raising questions pertaining to evolutionary origins of cognition itself. One hypothesis suggests evolution originated initially in primitive forms already endowed with rudimentary capabilities leading eventually to emergence of increasingly sophisticated capacities ultimately giving rise to modern day intelligence. According to this theory, biological agents would represent themselves essentially akin to abstract mathematical models whose internal state determines behavior once properly interpreted by appropriate effectors resulting finally in adaptive behavioral outcomes (Holyoak & Rizzolatti, 2 0 0 4). Another possibility posits that complexity arose gradually starting off simple pre ‐ evolved units becoming progressively integrated together forming larger complexes
