 us understanding what is happening at each stage along perceptual pathways: Noise increases as more data accumulate but does not affect performance until after an accumulated amount has been reached; thus it affects only later stages than early ones (e.g.).Our results suggest that neural mechanisms underlying human behavior can be understood through simple models based upon basic principles governing brain function rather than assuming complex computations such as Bayesian inference.
