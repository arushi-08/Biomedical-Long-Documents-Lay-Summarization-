 could not detect any evidence for awareness or consciousness at behavioural level during fMRI scanning sessions that lasted up to1 2 hours per day over several months after injury onset. We conclude: i] The primate brain can support complex cognitive functions despite severe sensory deprivation; ii] This suggests potential avenues towards recovery from blindness following lesions affecting early stages of vision processing iii] Our results suggest caution when interpreting data obtained using non invasive neuroimaging techniques alone as indicators of'residual function ".These observations also highlight challenges associated with translating experimental paradigms developed primarily within rodent models into clinical applications involving primates including humans. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
