 virulence factor as part of bacterial warfare between bacteria using different types of intercellular communication signals such as N -acyl- l ‐ homoserines or autoinducer 2 molecules. It further demonstrates cooperation within microbial communities where one species can be exploited but at times harmed when another member's activity threatens their own survival through interception / interference mechanisms like T6SSs deployed against other members' competitors. ▃ < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃ < INTRO > < FREETEXT > Introduction: ▃ Bacteria use multiple strategies including chemical signaling networks called "Quorum Sensing" (QS; Fig. In addition to being used alone, some microbes have evolved cooperative behaviors whereby they benefit from interactions with neighboring cells via diffusible factors produced either endogenously or exogenously To combat intruders, many Gram negative pathogens deploy Type 6 Secretion Systems (T6 SS) which inject toxic effector proteins into target eukaryotic host cells Our group has previously shown that B. pseudomallei K9 6MP ∆ tonB1 Δhcp1 strain lacking both T2SSrelated components Hcp1p and TonB2 was attenuated compared to parental strains in murine models Of note, our previous studies showed that while deletion mutations were made only in hcp loci, all three copies of tssA encoding putative structural subunits of T6SS1 had been deleted leaving behind two functional alleles of each locus One possible explanation could involve competition between siblings present inside colonies grown under conditions favoring biofilm formation versus liquid cultures growing exponentially without biofilms Growth restriction may occur if sibling rivals compete directly For example, it might happen if individual organisms grow faster than others due to differences in nutrient availability or oxygen tension resulting in more rapid division rates leading them out before competing neighbors. Alternatively, direct killing of non-kin bystanders would result If so, then nonlethal attack should lead to enhanced competitive advantage relative to isogenic controls even though death does take place. Indeed, several recent reports suggest that certain toxins delivered by T6SS2 contribute toward niche adaptation and pathogenesis While most known examples of interspecies antagonism rely upon physical interaction between interacting partners, here we report evidence suggesting that inter-specific antagonistic activities involving T6S1s play important roles in shaping community structure. Specifically, we found that expression levels of T6SS1 correlated positively with population density across various culture media containing diverse carbon sources indicating potential involvement of T6S1 effectors in intra-generic competitions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that loss of function mutation affecting any component protein encoded outside of the core set resulted in reduced ability to outperform WT counterparts in mixed populations despite having similar numbers per unit volume implying active participation of T6SS1 system itself rather than just secreted products. Finally, since T6SS1 plays critical functions in mediating resistance towards antibiotics targeting DNA replication and transcription These results support the hypothesis that T6SS1 contributes significantly to collective behavior enabling cross talk amongst genetically distinct individuals thereby contributing substantially to overall diversity Within polymicrobial infections caused by opportunistic human pathogenic Burkholderiae, spatial organization appears crucial for successful establishment of infection As mentioned above, although T6SS1 seems dispensable for planktonic lifestyle, it remains unclear whether T6SS1 mediates intra- vs. interspecific conflict in spatially structured environments such as mammalian hosts. Therefore, future experiments will focus primarily on understanding ecological consequences arising from differential contributions played by T6SS1 depending on environmental niches occupied by cooperating microorganisms. Overall, given emerging data implicating T6Ss in inter- & intraspecific conflicts, together with observations presented herein demonstrating significant contribution of T6SS1 to social dynamics, collectively highlight new facets about complex interplay occurring between closely linked groups of co-existing micro bes whose genomes encode numerous genetic elements involved in regulation of physiology and metabolism. Further investigation along these lines promises exciting discoveries regarding molecular basis underlying beneficial effects observed following antibiotic treatment. Moreover, identification of additional players controlling collaborative relationships shall help us understand basic principles governing emergence of drug resistant phenotypes especially considering increasing prevalence of multidrug tolerant persister subpopulations in chronic disease settings. < / FREETEXT > < / RESULT > ▃ ▃ < METHOD > < FREETEXT > Materials and Methods: ▃ Bacterial Strains and Media: All Escherichia coli K-1 2 derivatives constructed throughout this study carry F'lacI q pro Q Tn1 0 proC + 4 8 7 9 lacZ ΔM1 5 Δ [lac] X7 4recA1 endA1hsdR2 7supE4 4D gyrA RP4 derivative plasmid pKNG1 3 1. pBBR1MCS plasmids carrying deletions corresponding to btts1a, bts1b, vgrG  1, clpV, tagH, PAA0 0 5 5c, paaA2, ygiT, lolD, lipL, msbB3, fadR, rplU, fabZ, waaA, wzzE, lpxO, phoP, glpD, gacS, phzM, ppk, relBE, rpoBC, prsA, rssB, trxB, cysW, yejJ, yceY, ymdB, yoiX, yieI, ynfA, ylcA, ypdA, yrdC, ysbA, ygfH, ytfB, pdhA, nagAB, purEK, pyr
