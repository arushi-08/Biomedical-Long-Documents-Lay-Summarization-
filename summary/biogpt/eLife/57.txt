 genes. Our results demonstrate an evolutionary mechanism through which pleiotropy may be exploited as part of adaptive evolution at multiple levels within biological networks. They also highlight the importance of considering both functional redundancy among interacting components when studying complex traits such as flower size or shape because it allows buffering effects from one gene's interaction partners while maintaining its own contribution toward overall network performance under selection pressure.

[maize], Antirrhinum majus L.. In all cases, key regulators have emerged with conserved roles across diverse taxa; however, their relative contributions vary considerably depending on environmental conditions and organism – environment relationships. For instance, mutations affecting core patterning factors often result only mildly altered phenotypes compared with those caused directly via changes in growth rate during early stages of organogenesis but become more severe later due to compensatory mechanisms acting upon cell proliferation rates throughout ontogeny. These observations suggest strong selective pressures operating along different axes — temporal versus spatial dimensions — even if they share common molecular players involved in regulating similar processes. Thus far most studies investigating morphological diversity focus either exclusively on differences arising late after morphogenesis begins or consider patterns emerging earlier than morphology becomes apparent yet still being shaped developmentally. By contrast, few investigations address whether there might exist additional sources contributing significantly towards generating variability already before overt differentiation occurs. Such “cryptic ” variations could arise stochastically without any direct influence whatsoever until selected against once other aspects begin shaping final morphologies. Alternatively, some degree of preexisting structural plasticity would allow rapid responses following perturbation events occurring very soon thereafter. Indeed, recent work suggests substantial heritable variance existing prior to visible signs of organismal specialization exists not just amongst individuals belonging to distinct populations but rather seems ubiquitous irrespective of ecological niche preference. It remains unclear what role pre ‐ established structures play in facilitating evolvability given limited knowledge about potential causal variants driving observed population level heterogeneity. Nevertheless, understanding predispositions leading up to observable features will help elucidate general principles governing macro- vs. microarchitecture generation thereby providing insights into fundamental questions regarding modularity vs integration underpinning higher order organization of developing systems. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > One system where significant amounts of information concerning structure and dynamics of morphogenetic programs remain elusive concerns petals whose shapes differ dramatically between two sister Brassicaceae genera, A. thaliana1 2 0 ° rotated anticlinal septae facing each side instead of parallel ones found in C. hirtus ssp. filipes. Petalation thus appears highly plastic allowing plants varying widely in body plan complexity including leaf form, inflorescence branching pattern etc. To date no candidate transcription factor known so far controls differential specification of organs forming opposite sides of otherwise identical leaves nor does loss of AP3 activity lead to homeotic conversion suggesting alternative pathways must underlie asymmetric identity acquisition. Interestingly though, ectopic activation of class B MADS box proteins leads to transformation of adaxial cells giving rise to abaxially located carpels onto adjacent lateral tissues resulting in carpelloid stamens indicating partial reversion back to ancestral states. Furthermore, although many mutants affect meristem determinacy causing indeterminate meristems persisting beyond normal termination times, none affects initiation timing per se implying independent modes operate downstream of stem maintenance signals. Taken together, available evidence indicates that establishment of asymmetry involves several layers of hierarchical coordination involving various types of molecules ranging from small RNAs mediating epigenetic modifications to protein complexes capable of binding DNA sequences flanking target sites influencing chromatin state locally around promoters ultimately modulating transcript abundance. Given considerable conservation of major signaling cascades directing vegetative phase transition and shoot apical meristem fate determination little attention was paid previously to possible involvement of intrinsic determinants potentially responsible for initiating asymmetries preceding obvious anatomical distinctions. Yet, our previous study revealed striking similarities between mutant alleles associated with delayed onset of determinate phases originating independently in three distant lineages strongly supporting existence of shared mechanistic underpinnings behind heterochronic shifts seen here. Therefore, identification of causative polymorphisms should shed light on universal rules guiding emergence of novel architectures enabling diversification based solely on subtle alterations in spatiotemporal deployment of master switches coordinating critical steps required for proper progression of life cycle transitions. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Despite extensive efforts aimed at identifying sequence polymorphism putatively accounting for interspecific disparity in corolla symmetry, nothing had hitherto escaped notice except for rare examples showing complete absence of bilateral symmetric arrangements typical of wild type relatives whereas hybrids were intermediate phenotypically resembling parental genotypes. Although recessive inheritance seemed likely since reciprocal crosses yielded offspring exhibiting full penetrance, segregation ratios deviated markedly away from Mendelian expectations raising doubts surrounding heritability estimates obtained experimentally. More recently, comparative mapping approaches identified genomic intervals harboring putative candidates explaining hybrid incompatibilities revealing trans ‐ allelic incompatibility mediated disruption of cis
