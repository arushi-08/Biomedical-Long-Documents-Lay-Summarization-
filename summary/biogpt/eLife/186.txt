 role during synapse maturation / remodeling events such LTP induction. These results have implications on interpreting data obtained using single particle imaging techniques based upon organic fluorophores attached directly onto receptors rather than through chemical modification strategies used commonly when labeling proteins other than membrane transporters like GPCRs. The use of chemically modified protein tags may not be appropriate if one wishes to study surface dynamics over time scales beyond minutes due to potential changes caused by covalent attachment itself.
