 robots (e.g., “Jack ”); free flying insects such as bumblebees [Bombus impatiens]; humans walking on flat ground at different speeds while wearing various types of protective clothing – all within minutes after video recording without human intervention - thus demonstrating potential applications beyond simple insect surveillance systems used today. Our approach is also applicable outside biological contexts: it can be applied broadly to other image analysis domains where rapid high resolution object localization remains difficult due to low signal contrast between objects / background. ▃ ▃ ▃ Availability & implementation ▃ Source code freely accessible via GitHub https: / / github.com / kulp / deepposekkit under MIT license http: / / dx.doi.org / 1 0. 5 2 8 7 / zenodo.1 3 6 4 9 5 5.
