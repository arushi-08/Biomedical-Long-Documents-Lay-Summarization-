 processes such as filament assembly or disassembly by hydrolyzing nucleotides other than NTPs (Figure 1). The ability to engineer new activities into proteins will enable researchers to explore novel roles played by enzymes without altering their native function; however, our results highlight potential pitfalls when engineering enzyme active sites based on structural homology alone. In particular, mutations designed solely around conserved residues may have unintended effects if they alter interactions between catalytic groups rather than directly affecting catalysis itself [2 6 – 3 0]. Our work also demonstrates one way forward: using directed evolution methods combined with biochemical assays allows us to identify key differences among related molecules while avoiding many false positives due simply to sequence similarity within homologous families. These insights could help guide future efforts aimed at understanding complex cellular pathways where multiple enzymatic steps must occur simultaneously before any given step has been identified experimentally. Finally, although there were no obvious changes made near the putative phosphate sensor region of spoIVA compared to canonical G domain sequences, several amino acids surrounding this site differed significantly across species suggesting some degree of functional divergence had occurred over time since gene duplication events leading up to modern day B. anthracis strains. Thus far only two members of the family containing both domains — YlqF / YeaZ and RsgA - appear capable of catalyzing NTP hydrolytic cleavage via either single turnover kinetics experiments or crystal structures solved under different conditions including those lacking divalent metal ions thought necessary cofactors needed for most hydrolases. It remains possible that additional uncharacterized homologs exist whose mechanism differs substantially enough so that even subtle alterations would result in loss of functionality despite high levels of overall conservation throughout all three classes. Indeed, recent studies suggest that more diverse mechanisms might operate outside traditional hydrolase folds like Rossmann fold α + β motifs found commonly amongst metabolic kinases. Therefore, further investigation should focus upon identifying which residue positions contribute specifically towards each reaction type catalyzed by SpoIV orthologs. Such information provides insight regarding whether certain aspects of metabolism differ widely depending on organism phylogeny thereby providing clues about environmental pressures driving molecular adaptation through natural selection. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All chemicals unless otherwise noted came from Sigma Aldrich Chemical Co..

E. coli strain DH5α cells were grown routinely in Luria Broth medium supplemented with ampicillin sodium salt solution (Fisher Scientific International LLC) at 5 0µg ml − 1 final concentration except cultures harboring plasmids pEXP5-CT TOPO TA vector system (Invitrogen Life Sciences Corp.). Plasmid pET2 8a encoding N terminal His6 tag followed by TEV protease recognition motif was transformed into BL2 1DE3 competent cell line according manufacturer ’ s instructions provided by Novagen ®. Competent Escherichia Coli Rosetta ™ Cells (EMD Millipore Chemicals Ltd.) carrying plasmid pET4 1a coding C terminus Strep Tag fusion human GBP1 full length wild type construct kindly gifted Dr. Kevin M. Daumke (University College London School of Medicine & Dentistry). For expression purposes, bacteria were cultured overnight at room temperature until OD6 0 0nm reached ~ 0. 8 then induced with 1mM IPTG added drop wise after every 3hr till reaching desired O.D.6 0.nm value prior harvesting them later. Bacteria pellets collected following centrifugation were stored frozen at -8 0C ° C. Frozen pellet samples corresponding approximately 5gm wet weight per sample were thawed quickly once resuspended thoroughly in lysis buffer consisting of Tris HCl pH 7. 9 @ RT = 1X PBS 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set V EDTA free (Calbiochem  5 3 9 1 3 4) diluted 5X stock solutions prepared immediately beforehand and lysed mechanically by sonication method described below. Cell debris removed first by centrifuging twice at maximum speed for 2hrs at 4C °. Supernatant recovered next centrifuged again at max rpm for another hour at 4ºC resulting supernatant fraction enriched primarily consisted mostly of soluble recombinant target protein along with small amount insoluble inclusion bodies remaining trapped inside membrane fractions. Soluble extract thus isolated served subsequently as crude lysate source material suitable for purification procedures outlined here. Protein concentrations measured spectrophotometrically against known standards ranged generally above 1mg mL -1 making use of Bradford assay technique feasible. Purification procedure involved affinity chromatography performed essentially identically regardless what kind of column matrix employed namely Ni Sepharose High Performance resin packed columns equilibrated previously washed extensively with wash buffers composed of increasing imidazole gradient ranging from 5mM to 1M respectively dissolved in equilibration buffer.1 0mM Imidazole present in elution buffer helped remove non-specificly adsorbed contaminants efficiently leaving pure targets concentrated down to.5 mg L − 1 range yielding sufficient quantity for subsequent analysis techniques detailed below.The purity level achieved varied slightly dependent mainly on nature of bait molecule utilized i.e. His tagged versus StrepTactin fused constructs.
