 professors have no idea what they're doing but it's important because if I don't know then there will be nothing right … It ’ ll take some years before scientists can tell us more about why people die when their brains go into trouble after hours without oxygen!

Cells plated onto poly D Lysine coated glass coverslips placed inside Petri dishes containing Neurobasal medium supplemented withB2 7- supplement minus antioxidants (Invitrogen Life Technologies Inc. Carlsbad CA USA) plus penicillin streptomycin antibiotics solution (Sigma Aldrich Co LLC St. Louis MO USA). After incubation overnight, media was replaced every three days. siRNA transfection procedure Cultured primary cortical neuron preparation Primary dissociated mouse embryonic day E1 5cerebra cortex obtained asdescribed above were triturated mechanically until homogenous suspension followed bycentrifugation of1ml supernatant at2rpm for 5min.

Resuspended astrocyte suspensions weremixed gently with equal volume of freshly prepared purified CGC isolatesin vitro co culturedish pre-treated with Poly L Ornithine hydrobromide (SIGMA Chemical Company St Loius MI USA). Mixed glia - enriched layer separated out manually based ondifferential adherence characteristics. On DIV1 2. microglia outgrew rapidly overgrowing other types of non-astrocytic population which settled down around them later. Astrocytes remained attached even beyond second week onwards whereas microglial populations disappeared almost entirely thereafter. At least four independent preparations yielded similar results.2 4h prior experimentation all experimental groups except Control group received normal growth conditionstotal density = ~ 6x1 0 ^ ³ cm -2 seeded evenly across six wells each. Experimental groupswere exposed to normoxia (room air equilibrated atmosphere supplied with humidified gas mix composed of O2\ CO2 ¼ 9 5. percent ∶ 5 percentÞ throughout experiment duration. Hypoxic treatment consisted only of continuous supply of atmospheric level pure argon balanced gaseous phase maintained below pO2 value of approximately 1 0mm Hg. Oxygen tension measurements indicated effective reduction of ambient partial pressure of oxygento less than zero values already after first hour of hypoxictreatment.2 h timepoint samples collected immediately preceding initiation of normoxic vs. hyperoxygenation treatments served as controls.
