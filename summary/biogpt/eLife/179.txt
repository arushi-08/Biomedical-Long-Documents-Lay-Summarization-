 allele system at the genomic level. Our study also provides evidence supporting convergent functional shifts associated with morphological diversification across angiosperms: from flower size control through organ number determination toward changes affecting plant architecture such as branching patterns. Finally, given their role in controlling important traits related to reproduction success, including pollen tube growth rates during pollination events, CYP7 3 4A enzymes may represent promising targets for crop improvement strategies aimed at increasing seed production efficiency via assisted cross hybridization techniques. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > â–ƒ
