 sites promotes binding between DAF-2 5, an inhibitor protein for calcineurin activity, and DAF-2L2 7 0 – S2 9 4 region containing two conserved LxVP motifs required for interaction with CNA subunits [; Figure 1A]. Thus, our results suggest that calcium signals from different sources converge on common downstream effectors such as CANNA proteins during aging processes via distinct mechanisms: Insulin signaling inhibits CALN1 function while activating other isoforms of calnexins whereas nutrient availability stimulates both types of calcineurin- mediated pathways leading to activation of FOXOs. Our study provides new insights into molecular interactions underlying longevity control under diverse environmental stresses encountered throughout life course. These observations may be useful when designing therapeutic strategies against age related diseases associated with impaired proteostasis network functions due to altered cellular homeostasis caused either directly or indirectly by genetic mutations affecting components involved in Ca ² ⁺ -regulated signal transduction cascades. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > C.

(1 7K, docx) Image 1 < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > In mammals, there exist four genes encoding catalytic subunit A isozymes α, β, γ and δ encoded by Ppp3ca, Ppm1g, Ppp 3cb and Ppp1 0g loci, each having multiple splice variants resulting in over twenty possible combinations among them. Similarly, three regulatory subunit B1 isozyme ε, γ1 and γ2 gene products coded by Cnb1, Cntg1 and Cng2a have been identified along with several alternative splicing forms giving rise to more than thirty potential heterodimers. Therefore, functional diversity within PP2A family members arises not only because they differ slightly in their amino acid sequences across species, but even further owing to differences arising out of post translational modifications occurring specifically upon association of specific pairs of A- and B- subunits forming heterotrimeric holoenzymes exhibiting unique substrate specificities towards particular substrates depending on cell cycle stage or tissue specificity. For example, methylation catalyzed exclusively by leucine carboxyl methyltransferase LCMT-1L increases affinity toward certain phosphoprotein targets thereby enhancing dephosphorylation rates significantly compared to unmethylated counterparts suggesting differential roles played by methylated vs. non-modified PP2As. Likewise, acetylation has recently emerged as another important modification regulating enzymatic activities of many key players implicated in cancer progression and neurodegenerative disorders. Acetylation occurs predominantly though lysine residues located outside active site pocket where most known inhibitors bind indicating existence of novel allosteric pockets amenable to drug targeting. Although much remains unclear about precise role of individual PTMs carried out individually or together especially considering complex nature involving interplay amongst all those mentioned above events one can envision development of drugs capable selectively modulating any given PTM event without compromising others simultaneously if desired outcome could indeed emerge following treatment using appropriate combination therapies based solely on knowledge gained regarding target identity and mode of action rather then relying entirely on empirical approaches currently used clinically today. This approach would help avoid undesirable side effects often observed after administration of broad spectrum agents designed originally intended primarily aimed at inhibiting single enzyme class acting promiscuously instead taking advantage of selective inhibition directed precisely according to disease etiology targeted therapeutically. It should however remain clear now whether similar principles apply true beyond just human systems since recent studies indicate presence of extensive cross talk existing between some classes of posttranslational modifiers themselves making identification of effective combinatorial therapy difficult particularly once redundancy exists inherent property shared by almost every member belonging to same group e.g. histone deacetylases etc.. Nevertheless, despite tremendous progress made in understanding complexity behind pathogenesis linked aberrant epigenetic changes being increasingly recognized playing critical causative links contributing greatly to onset and maintenance of numerous chronic degenerative pathologies ranging from metabolic syndrome characterized mainly by obesity coupled diabetes mellitus Type I to cardiovascular complications culminating eventually causing heart failure, neurodegeneration etc. still very limited number of pharmacological interventions available till date effectively address major causes responsible for majority cases diagnosed worldwide suffering debilitating ailments collectively termed “Age Associated Disorders ” (AAD ’ s) whose incidence continues unabated posing serious threat to global health care system unless concerted efforts will come up addressing issues pertaining prevention altogether! We believe discovery of small molecules able to modulate expression levels of crucial regulators controlling physiological responses essential for maintaining healthy state irrespective of etiological origin holds great promise providing better options for treating patients afflicted with AADs long before symptoms arise hence reducing overall burden placed on already overburdened healthcare facilities presently facing us world wide population living longer lives thanks largely unaffected by current medical advances introduced earlier decades ago. To achieve success, detailed mechanistic insight must first become evident followed thereafter implementation of rational design strategy employing structure guided screening methods allowing selection of compounds possessing desirable properties suitable enough to meet stringent criteria set forth beforehand ensuring no adverse effect might occur subsequent to use of said compound later developed commercially offering huge market share. Such endeavors require establishment of robust high throughput assays enabling rapid evaluation of large numbers of chemical entities rapidly identifying lead candidates prior going ahead costly clinical trials requiring
