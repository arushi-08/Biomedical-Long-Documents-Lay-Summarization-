 roles as selector TFs at specific positions within animal development programs. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The origins of morphological differences: keys to understanding arthropod diversification'. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > homeodomain, phylogenomics, regulatory network reconstruction, transcriptional regulation, embryonic patterning < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Animal embryogenesis relies on highly regulated spatio-temporal activation or repression events involving hundreds if not thousands of developmentally important regulators (Davidson et al. 2 0 1 5). These include sequence-specific DNA binding motifs such as zinc fingers [C2H2 type; Krüppel family member 3 6], homeodomains [HD; Paired class Homeobox containing domain], POU domains [Pit Class Homeodomain Containing Domain] etc.. In addition they often contain one or more transactivation domains allowing recruitment of co activators like CBP histone acetyltransferase complexes among others leading ultimately to changes in chromatin structure thereby facilitating access of RNA polymerase II machinery required for active mRNA synthesis (Levine & Tjian, 1 9 8 4; Ptashne, 1 9 7 8a, b). Although most known metazoan genomes encode several hundred TF types each having distinct combinations thereof depending upon species ’ needs, it has been shown recently through comparative genomics studies across metazoans that only few core components have remained largely unchanged throughout evolutionary time scales while many new ones appeared independently multiple times over history suggesting functional redundancy between existing homologs when lost due to mutations (King et al. 2 0 1 2a, c; Srivastava et al. 2 0 1 5a, d). For example, although Drosophila melanogaster genome encodes about ∼ 1 4 0 predicted HDs belonging mostly to four classes — Antennapedia complex (ANT-C), Ultrabithorax (Ubx) -abdominal A cluster (ABD-B), Abdominal B clusters (AbdB) and Deformed (DfD) - none was found outside arthropods whereas vertebrates possess up to six HOX paralogs per chromosome arm indicating massive duplications occurred after divergence from invertebrates probably resulting into novel genetic circuitries controlling vertebrate morphogenesis including limbs formation (Mann et al. 2 0 0 9a, b). Similarly, despite conservation of basic features involved in early cell fate specification processes, there exist major divergences regarding later stages where cells acquire specialized fates giving rise to various tissues and organs characteristic of particular clades thus providing unique opportunities towards generating diverse morphologies via differential deployment of key players acting downstream of initial signals received initially similar amongst organisms yet diversified thereafter (Arendt et al. 2 0 0 7a, b; Bürglen, 2 0 1 4a, b). How did so much complexity evolve without losing essential elements needed for proper execution of fundamental cellular decisions remains poorly understood especially since little attention had hitherto focused exclusively onto identifying those parts whose loss would be detrimental enough to prevent survival beyond single celled ancestors even though recent work suggests otherwise (Kadam et al. 2 0 1 5b). Here I will discuss what could explain why certain aspects of eukaryotic biology appear less robust than expected given current knowledge concerning mechanisms underlying control of spatiotemporal dynamics associated with tissue differentiation programmes based mainly around cis ‐ element sequences rather then trans ‑ factor repertoires deployed differently according to organism's requirements. To do so first requires reconstructing ancient versions of biological systems before considering whether extant forms can still perform similarly under altered conditions arising either naturally occurring e.g. environmental fluctuations or artificially induced i.e. experimental manipulations aimed at mimicking natural scenarios encountered earlier in life cycles hence potentially revealing hidden traits possibly critical for adaptation capabilities acquired subsequently following speciation event. Such approach may help us understand better both general principles governing evolvability versus robustness issues faced by living beings facing ever changing environments and perhaps shed light on possible routes toward artificial design strategies capable of reproducing real world phenomena observed today albeit far away from reality. Indeed, synthetic biologists strive nowadays to develop ‘ smart molecules ’ able to mimic properties inherent to actual entities ranging from simple chemical reactions used widely in industry to sophisticated multi modular structures designed originally conceived out of scratch aiming ultimate goal being emulation of original designs seen now in Nature itself (Ali et al. 2 0 1 2b; Csermely et al. 2 0 1 3a, b; Gavrilov et al. 2 0 1 3b; Hart et al. 2 0 1 4b; Romero et al. 2 0 1 6a, b). One way forward lies indeed in revisiting old models developed decades ago focusing primarily on biochemical characteristics instead of looking specifically at organismal level functioning particularly because modern approaches allow studying individual modules operating together inside larger contexts recapitulating entire pathways enabling identification of missing links responsible for emergence of emergent behaviors unattainable solely relying on reductionist methods alone. As discussed below, here my aim shall focus on exploring potential role played by combinatorial use of two evolutionarily unrelated groups of ubiquitous master regulator TFs namely the HOM
