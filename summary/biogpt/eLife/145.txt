 suggests an important function: it prevents premature disassembly by chaperones before SNAREs assemble into fusogenic complexes at sites where vesicles dock with target membranes prior to membrane merger during neurotransmitter release. This study provides insights about molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic transmission as regulated through multiple layers within individual protein molecules using single molecule techniques combined with biochemical assays. © 2 0 1 9 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
