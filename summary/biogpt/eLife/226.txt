 helices can be found at any position within transmembrane segments 6 – 8; however, only those located between two conserved proline residues have been shown previously not to affect function or stability when mutated individually. Finally, our results suggest distinct roles during substrate translocation: whereas one side chain coordinates copper on both sides of membrane bilayer via hydrogen bonds / salt bridges involving backbone atoms, another residue serves solely as part of proton relay network required by ATP hydrolysis cycle. This study provides fundamental insight regarding structure − activity relationships among eukaryotic Cu + -translocating P1B-4A subfamily members involved in human health disorders like Menkes disease and Wilson ’ s syndrome. It will serve future studies aimed toward understanding molecular mechanisms underlying diseases caused due to mutations affecting ATP7A gene encoding hSPCA1 protein responsible for egress of excess intracellular cuprous ions out of cells [2 0 •]. In addition it may help design small molecules targeting specific sites identified here using computational approaches based upon homology models built herein. These compounds could potentially aid treatment strategies against pathologies associated with aberrant functioning of other pathogenic proteins belonging to similar class A family pumps implicated in multidrug resistance phenotypes observed clinically today — e.g., ABCB1 transporter causing cancer drug efflux phenotype. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Keywords: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Copper trafficking machinery, Membrane bioenergetics, Molecular dynamics simulations, Homology modeling, X-ray crystallography, Functional analysis, Metal selectivity determinants, Proton transfer pathway < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Research organism: < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Other < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > All living things need trace elements inside them because they cannot grow without some kind of nutrient molecule known generically as ‘ iron '. For example, many enzymes use Fe II instead of oxygen gas produced naturally every day while burning food sources rich in fat. However if too much iron goes unchecked then humans become sick - most notably brain damage which leads children born prematurely often suffer later life long disabilities. To prevent problems getting worse researchers must understand what happens where there's more than enough iron left behind after birth. One way people get rid themselves off unwanted levels of iron involves pumping it back outside healthy body tissues rather than leaving waste products stuck under skin tissue around blood vessels. But exactly why do bacteria pump extra amount of iron away from each cell compared to normal mammalian physiology? And does having less active enzyme make animals sicker again? Answering questions about bacterial systems would allow scientists working towards developing drugs designed specifically targeted at preventing harmful effects related to high concentrations of certain types of nutrients being pumped out of diseased animal bodies before symptoms appear. Such treatments might include making antibiotics able to enter unhealthy parts of your own immune system better target microbes growing abnormally fast since antibiotic resistant strains continue spreading worldwide despite efforts made over decades now trying hard ever harder to find effective solutions. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > Bacteria contain specialized organelles termed magnetosomes used to orient along magnetic fields generated externally allowing movement down water currents created near earth surface. Magnetotactic microorganisms produce nano sized particles composed mainly of magnetite crystals surrounded by lipid bilayers containing various kinds of biomolecules necessary for biomineralization process. Iron oxide nanoparticles synthesized intracellularly form chains wrapped up together forming spherical clusters referred to as “cubes ” whose size varies depending on species composition ranging typically 5 0nm diameter for uncultured marine Proteobacteria named Candidatus Nitrosoarchaeum limnia strain ANA-3 (Figure 1A top panel). Each cube contains approximately 7 × 9 nm single crystal unit consisting mostly of Fe3O4 phase arranged face centered cubic lattice stabilized primarily by organic ligands attached covalently onto its surfaces resulting in superparamagnetic behavior above room temperature. Interestingly, genes coding for putative multi subunit complexes mediating synthesis of biogenic minerals were recently discovered next to genomic regions harboring homologs of cation diffusion facilitator superfamily (CDF) -type divalent cations importers suggesting possible involvement of secondary carriers in formation of inorganic mineral aggregates resembling ferrihydrite cores formed extracellularly prior mineralization steps mediated exclusively by primary carrier FeoAB complex described earlier (Figure 1C bottom panels). Based on sequence similarity search performed elsewhere, three different families of CDFs namely ZntA, MntC and YiiM subfamilies encoded close proximity to respective operons predicted to mediate uptake of Zn 2 +, Mn 2 + & Co 2 + respectively indicating potential cooperation amongst diverse classes of solute symporters- possibly serving multiple functions besides facilitating import of transition metal- substrates transported subsequently followed by reduction reactions leading ultimately to biosynthesis of ferric oxides. Among others, genome sequencing projects revealed presence of additional uncharacterized paralogs closely linked to corresponding operon sequences further strengthening hypothesis implicating existence of functionally redundant yet unidentified players capable of performing analogous tasks thereby providing protection against toxicity arising owing to accumulation of non physiological level of particular metallic cofactors. Indeed recent experimental evidence suggests co occurrence of homologous sets of orthologs representing either CdfA- or MntC-
